While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector of image Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straight-forward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs. Please check out our webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/stablediffusion-with-brain/.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

In 2021-2022, study participants described the arrival of new, unusually potent tablets sold as ostensibly controlled substances, without a prescription, directly from pharmacies that cater to US tourists. Concurrently, fentanyl- and methamphetamine-based counterfeit prescription drugs have driven escalating overdose death rates in the US, however their presence in Mexico has not been assessed.

AimsTo characterize the availability of counterfeit and authentic controlled substances at pharmacies in Northern Mexico available to English-speaking tourists without a prescription.

MethodsWe employed an iterative, exploratory, mixed methods design. Longitudinal ethnographic data was used to characterize tourist-oriented micro-neighborhoods and guide the selection of n=40 pharmacies in n=4 cities in Northern Mexico. In each pharmacy, samples of ""oxycodone"", ""Xanax"", and ""Adderall"" were sought as single pills, during English-language encounters, after which detailed ethnographic accounts were recorded. We employed immunoassay-based testing strips to check each pill for the presence of fentanyls, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and methamphetamines. We used Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy to further characterize drug contents.

ResultsOf 40 pharmacies, these controlled substances could be obtained in any form with no prescription at 68.3% and as single pills at 46.3%. Counterfeit pills were obtained at n=11 (26.8%) of pharmacies. Of n=45 samples sold as one-off controlled substances, n=20 were counterfeit including 9 of 11 (81.8%) of samples sold as ""Adderall"" that contained methamphetamine, and 8 of 27 (29.6%) of samples sold as ""Oxycodone"" that contained fentanyl, and n=3  Oxycodone samples containing heroin. Pharmacies providing counterfeit drugs were uniformly located in tourist-serving micro-neighborhoods, and generally featured English-language advertisements for erectile dysfunction medications and  painkillers. Pharmacy employees occasionally expressed concern about overdose risk and provided harm reduction guidance.

DiscussionThe availability of fentanyl-, heroin-, and methamphetamine-based counterfeit medications in Northern Mexico represents a public health risk, and occurs in the context of 1) the normalization of medical tourism as a response to rising unaffordability of healthcare in the US, 2) plummeting rates of opioid prescription in the US, affecting both chronic pain patients and the availability of legitimate pharmaceuticals on the unregulated market, 3) the rise of fentanyl-based counterfeit opioids as a key driver of the fourth, and deadliest-to-date, wave of the opioid crisis. It is not possible to distinguish counterfeit medications based on appearance, because identically-appearing authentic and counterfeit versions are often sold in close geographic proximity. Nevertheless, US tourist drug consumers may be more trusting of controlled substances purchased directly from pharmacies. Due to Mexicos limited opioid overdose surveillance infrastructure, the current death rate from these substances remains unknown.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

MethodA cohort was selected from German routine health care data covering 38.9 million individuals. Based on documented diagnoses, we identified individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 through December 31, 2020. Patients were matched 1:3 to control patients without COVID-19. Both groups were followed up until June 30, 2021. We used the four quarters preceding the index date until the end of follow-up to analyze the onset of autoimmune diseases during the post-acute period. Incidence rates (IR) per 1000 person-years were calculated for each outcome and patient group. Poisson models were deployed to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of developing an autoimmune disease conditional on a preceding diagnosis of COVID-19.

ResultsIn total, 641,704 patients with COVID-19 were included. Comparing the incidence rates in the COVID-19 (IR=15.05, 95% CI: 14.69-15.42) and matched control groups (IR=10.55, 95% CI: 10.25-10.86), we found a 42.63% higher likelihood of acquiring autoimmunity for patients who had suffered from COVID-19. This estimate was similar for common autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, or Sjogren syndrome. The highest IRR was observed for autoimmune disease of the vasculitis group. Patients with a more severe course of COVID-19 were at a greater risk for incident autoimmune diseases.

ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an increased risk of developing new-onset autoimmune diseases after the acute phase of infection.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

The high genetic similarity between HKU4-related coronaviruses and MERS-CoV makes them an attractive subject of research for modeling potential zoonotic spillover scenarios. In this study, we identify a novel coronavirus contaminating agricultural rice RNA sequencing datasets from Wuhan, China. The datasets were generated by the Huazhong Agricultural University in early 2020. We were able to assemble the complete viral genome sequence, which revealed that it is a novel HKU4-related merbecovirus. The assembled genome is 98.38% identical to the closest known full genome sequence, Tylonycteris pachypus bat isolate BtTp-GX2012. Using in silico modeling, we identified that the novel HKU4-related coronavirus spike protein likely binds to human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor used by MERS-CoV. We further identified that the novel HKU4-related coronavirus genome has been inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome in a format consistent with previously published coronavirus infectious clones. Additionally, we have found a near complete read coverage of the spike gene of the MERS-CoV reference strain HCoV-EMC/2012, and identify the likely presence of a HKU4-related-MERS chimera in the datasets. Our findings contribute to the knowledge of HKU4-related coronaviruses and document the use of a previously unpublished HKU4 reverse genetics system in apparent MERS-CoV related gain-of-function research. Our study also emphasizes the importance of improved biosafety protocols in sequencing centers and coronavirus research facilities.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine first became available, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over the following 26 weeks was examined. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression, with change in dominant circulating lineages over time accounted for by time-dependent coefficients. The analysis was adjusted for the pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 51017 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 4424 (8.7%) during the study. In multivariable analysis, the bivalent vaccinated state was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 during the BA.4/5 dominant (HR, .71; 95% C.I., .63-.79) and the BQ dominant (HR, .80; 95% C.I., .69-.94) phases, but decreased risk was not found during the XBB dominant phase (HR, .96; 95% C.I., .82-.1.12). Estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 29% (95% C.I., 21%-37%), 20% (95% C.I., 6%-31%), and 4% (95% C.I., -12%-18%), during the BA.4/5, BQ, and XBB dominant phases, respectively. Risk of COVID-19 also increased with time since most recent prior COVID-19 episode and with the number of vaccine doses previously received.

ConclusionsThe bivalent COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded modest protection overall against COVID-19 while the BA.4/5 lineages were the dominant circulating strains, afforded less protection when the BQ lineages were dominant, and effectiveness was not demonstrated when the XBB lineages were dominant.

SummaryAmong 51017 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the bivalent COVID-19 vaccine was 29% effective in preventing infection while the BA.4/5 lineages were dominant, and 20% effective while the BQ lineages were. Effectiveness was not demonstrated when the XBB lineages were dominant.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

Here we used COVID-19 patient data from Hong Kong to characterise the severity profile of COVID-19 and to examine factors associated with fatality of infection.

MethodsTime-varying and age-specific effective severity measured by case-hospitalization risk and hospitalization risk was estimated with all individual COVID-19 case data collected in Hong Kong from 23 January 2020 through to 26 October 2022 over six epidemic waves, in comparison with estimates of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 during the 2009 pandemic. The intrinsic severity of Omicron BA.2 was compared with the estimate for the ancestral strain with the data from unvaccinated patients without previous infections. Factors potentially associated with the fatality risk of hospitalized Omicron patients were also examined.

ResultsWith 32,222 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 9,669 deaths confirmed over 6 epidemic waves in Hong Kong, the time-varying hospitalization fatality risk dramatically increased from below 10% before the largest fifth wave of Omicron BA.2, to 41% during the peak of the fifth wave when hospital resources were severely constrained. The age-specific fatality risk in unvaccinated hospitalized Omicron cases was comparable to the estimates for unvaccinated cases with the ancestral strain. During epidemics predominated by Omicron BA.2, the highest fatality risk was amongst unvaccinated patients aged [&ge;]80 years and the risk was inversely associated with the number of vaccination doses received.

ConclusionsOmicron has comparable intrinsic severity to the ancestral Wuhan strain although the effective severity is substantially lower in Omicron cases due to vaccination. With a moderate-to-high coverage of vaccination, hospitalized COVID-19 patients caused by Omicron subvariants appeared to have similar age-specific risks of fatality to patients hospitalized with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

After COVID-19 infections, amyloid-{beta}, neurogranin, tau and phosphorylated tau were detected extracellularly, implicating possible neurodegenerative processes.

The present study describes the possible induction of protein aggregation by the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease (3CLpro) possibly relevant in neuropathology, such as aggregation of tau, alpha-synuclein and TPD-43. Further investigations demonstrated that tau was proteolytically cleaved by the viral protease 3CL and, consequently, generated aggregates.

This has involved the removal of measures for limiting viral spread, resulting in a large burden of recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Crucial for managing this burden is the concept of the so-called wall of hybrid immunity, through repeated reinfections and vaccine boosters, to reduce the risk of severe disease and death. Protection against both infection and severe disease is provided by the induction of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against SARS-CoV-2. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) waning and rapid viral evolution both degrade nAb binding titers. The recent emergence of variants with strongly immune evasive potential against both the vaccinal and natural immune responses raises the question of whether the wall of population-level immunity can be maintained in the face of large jumps in nAb binding potency. Here we use an agent-based simulation to address this question. Our findings suggest large jumps in viral evolution may cause failure of population immunity resulting in sudden increases in mortality. As a rise in mortality will only become apparent in the weeks following a wave of disease, reactive public health strategies will not be able to provide meaningful risk mitigation. Learning to live with the virus could thus lead to large death tolls with very little warning. Our work points to the importance of proactive management strategies for the ongoing pandemic, and to the need for multifactorial approaches to COVID-19 disease control.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

An essential step towards understanding brain function is to obtain a parts list, i.e., a catalog of cell types, of the brain. Here, we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell type atlas was created based on the combination of two single-cell-level, whole-brain-scale datasets: a single- cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of [~]7 million cells profiled, and a spatially resolved transcriptomic dataset of [~]4.3 million cells using MERFISH. The atlas is hierarchically organized into five nested levels of classification: 7 divisions, 32 classes, 306 subclasses, 1,045 supertypes and 5,200 clusters. We systematically analyzed the neuronal, non-neuronal, and immature neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell type organization in different brain regions, in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain: the dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. We also systematically characterized cell-type specific expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and transcription factors. The study uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types across the brain, suggesting they mediate a myriad of modes of intercellular communications. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell type classification in the adult mouse brain and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole-mouse-brain transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for deep and integrative investigations of cell type and circuit function, development, and evolution of the mammalian brain.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

China, the last large country to end its ""zero-COVID"" policies, is currently facing its own massive Omicron-related wave, and the final impact of that wave remains uncertain. We have seen repeatedly that the epidemiological characteristics of new variants can have profound impacts on global health outcomes. While the characteristics of these new variants are difficult to predict ahead of their emergence, considering the impact of potential future scenarios is of central importance for prudent planning and policy making. This paper samples across a range of potential variant-level characteristics to provide global forecasts of infections, hospitalisations, and deaths in the face of ongoing Omicron-related transmission and waning levels of past immunity and evaluates a range of interventions that may diminish the impact of future waves.

MethodsWe created a susceptible-exposed-infectious dynamic model that accounts for vaccine uptake and effectiveness, antiviral administration, the emergence of new variants, and waning protection from both infection- and vaccine-derived immunity. Using this model, we first estimated past infections, hospitalisations, and deaths by variant, location, and day. We used these findings to more fully understand the global progression of the COVID-19 pandemic through December 12, 2022. Second, we forecasted these same outcome measures under five potential variant emergence scenarios. Third, we evaluated three different interventions in isolation and in concert within each potential variant scenario, to assess the impact of available intervention strategies through June 30, 2023.

FindingsWe estimated that from November 15, 2021, through December 12, 2022, there were 8.60 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6.37-11.7) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 13.1 million (10.6-16.5) hospitalisations, and 3.04 million (2.65-3.55) deaths, the majority of which were attributable to Omicron variants (98.5% [97.4-99.1] of infections, 82.6% [76.7-86.3] of hospitalisations, and 72.4% [66.4-76.0] of deaths). Compared to the pre-Omicron pandemic period from January 1, 2020, to November 15, 2021, we estimated that there were more than twice as many infections (214% [163-286]) globally from November 15, 2021, to December 12, 2022, but only 20.6% (19.8-21.4) of the estimated deaths. The massive Omicron waves and high vaccination rates in many high-income countries have together contributed to high levels of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, leaving only 97.3% (96.3-98.2) of the global population with no protection as of December 1, 2022. Concurrently, however, China, where only 17.6% [5.28-34.8] of the population have ever experienced infection due to its zero-COVID policy, requires special attention over the next few months, as all our future scenarios predict substantial increases in transmission, hospitalisation, and death in China in now that zero-COVID policies have been relaxed. Under the future scenario we consider most plausible (a scenario with another new Omicron-like variant emerging and reference levels of the drivers of transmission), we estimated there will be an additional 5.19 billion (3.11-7.78) infections, 13.6 million (8.50-21.8) hospitalisations, and 2.74 million (1.40-5.68) deaths between December 12, 2022, and June 30, 2023, with the Western Pacific region projected to sustain the highest rates of additional deaths, driven primarily by the uncontained outbreak in China. By comparison, a baseline scenario in which no new variant emerges results in 3.54 billion (2.24-5.43) infections, 6.26 million (4.11-9.65) hospitalisations, and 1.58 million (0.829-3.95) deaths in the same forecast period. The ability for a new variant to break through past infection- and vaccine-derived immunity greatly influences future outcomes: we estimate a new variant with the high severity of Delta, but correspondingly moderate immunity breakthrough rates will have difficulty overtaking current variants and will result in similar outcomes to the Omicron-like variant scenario with 3.64 billion (2.26-5.83) new infections, 7.87 million (4.81-13.0) new hospitalisations, and 2.87 million (1.03-5.56) new deaths. Finally, if we consider a variant that combines the high infectiousness and breakthrough rates of Omicron with the high severity of Delta, we again estimate 5.19 billion (3.11-7.78) new infections, but due to the presumed increase in severe outcomes, we estimate 30.2 million (13.4-51.2) new hospitalisations and 15.9 million (4.31-35.9) deaths over the forecasted period. The impacts of interventions vary by variant characteristics and region of the world, with increased mask usage and reimplementation of some mandates having massive impact in some regions while having less impact in others. Finally, assuming variant spread was as rapid as observed for Omicron, we find almost no impact of a rapidly developed and deployed variant-targeted booster.

InterpretationAs infection-derived and vaccine-conferred protection wanes, we expect infections to rise, but as most of the worlds population has some level of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as of December 12, 2022, all but the most pessimistic forecasts in this analysis do not predict a massive global surge by June 30, 2023. Paradoxically, China, due to its lower levels of population immunity and effective vaccination will likely experience substantial numbers of infections and deaths that, due to its large population size, will adversely affect the global toll. This could be substantially mitigated by existing intervention options including masking, vaccination, health-care preparedness, and effective antiviral compounds for those at most at risk of poor outcomes. While still resulting in morbidity and mortality, this endemic transmission provides protection from less transmissible variants and particularly protects against sub-lineages of the more severe pre-Omicron variants. In the scenarios where a new variant does emerge and spread globally, however, the speed of this spread may be too fast to rely on even the most quickly developed mRNA vaccines to provide protection soon enough. Existing vaccines and boosters have played an important role in increasing immunity worldwide, but the continued contribution of mask usage (both past and future) in the prevention of infection and death cannot be understated. The characteristics of future COVID-19 variants are inherently difficult to predict, and our forecasts do show considerable differences in outcomes as a function of these variant properties. Given the uncertainty surrounding what type of variant will next emerge, the world would be wise to remain vigilant in 2023 as we move to the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a plethora of COVID-19 models developed; most were designed to focus on a specific location (or small set of locations) and a short time horizon (usually less than a month). A number of modelling consortiums were created to develop ensemble predictions across models of this sort (e.g., the COVID-19 Forecast Hub [maintained by the Reich Lab of the University of Massachusetts Amherst in collaboration with USA CDC (Centers for Disease Control)] or the European COVID-19 Forecast Hub [created by a multitude of infectious disease modelling teams and coordinated by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)]), and the final results typically predicted four weeks, and at most, six weeks forward. The models combined for these ensembles ran the spectrum from transmission dynamic models that incorporated complex mixing patterns between individuals, to machine learning models that were agnostic of the fact that the input and output were associated with infectious diseases. Moreover, most of these models were designed to predict the most likely outcome as opposed to evaluate potential future scenarios. A small subset of these models were created with this sort of flexibility, though they have primarily been applied to limited global regions (e.g., USA CDC scenarios) and they typically do not evaluate multiple potential scenarios three to six months into the future. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) COVID-19 model has been generating and publishing forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths globally with four-month time horizons and making these available at mostly weekly intervals on its website since March 26, 2020 (https://covid19.healthdata.org). The cadence has now slowed to monthly updates as in many parts of the world, data needed to support the modelling of COVID-19 have reduced and/or ceased to be collected as the attention of policy makers and funders is drawn elsewhere. Several epidemiological scenarios have been evaluated in these online estimates, but the outcomes have not been formally compared across these scenarios globally into 2023. This article is also the first full formal documentation of the IHME-SEI model incorporating foundation work on infection-fatality ratio, more robust cumulative infection calculations, as well as more recently developed work that allows for waning immunity.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this study is the first to forecast multiple future COVID-19 scenarios of variant emergence against a background of high rates of past SARS-CoV-2 exposure globally, nationally, and for a set of subnational locations, six months into the future. It is also one of the first to forecast the impact of China relaxing its zero-COVID policy. The scenarios considered were selected to represent a range of realistic potential futures and are directly comparable by region, country, and territory (and in many instances subnational units), to identify future risk as well as inform on the effectiveness of potential intervention strategies. In particular, we directly compared scenarios where a future variant is presumed to be similar to Omicron (high infectiousness, low severity, high immune-breakthrough), Delta (moderate infectiousness, high severity, moderate immune-breakthrough), a Delta with increased immune escape (moderate infectiousness, high severity, high immune-breakthrough), or the worst of both (high infectiousness, high severity, high immune-breakthrough) to a scenario where no new variant emerges. We then evaluated several interventions against each potential variant future, each in isolation and in concert. In addition to providing timely predictions for China as they remove restrictions, we provide insight into which locations may be at highest risk for future COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations, and deaths, and what they might do to mitigate the worst possible outcomes.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe Omicron waves have already resulted in an estimated 8.60 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6.37-11.7) infections in the past 13 months globally (from November 15, 2021, through December 12, 2022). Previous exposure to other variants and vaccination have together resulted in 97.3% (96.3-98.2) of the global population being estimated to have some immunity to SARS-CoV-2 as of December 12, 2022. While infection- and vaccine-derived immunity has and will continue to wane, this protection and ongoing transmission of currently circulating variants will mitigate the scale of the next COVID-19 wave. The scale of mitigation possible is highly dependent on the characteristics of the next variant. To assess the potential for a COVID-19 surge in early 2023, we evaluated several future variant scenarios, as well as the unlikely baseline scenario of no new variant emerging. In the absence of any new variant, our baseline model predicts 1.58 million (0.829-3.95) deaths globally between December 12, 2022, and June 30, 2023. If a variant with similar characteristics to Omicron (eg, high infectiousness and low severity) emerges on January 15, 2023, our model predicts 2.74 million (1.40-5.68) additional deaths over the same period. A variant with the characteristics of Delta is predicted to have difficulty overtaking current variants and past immunity, and despite its substantial severity, our model predicts a number of deaths similar to an Omicron-like new variant (2.87 million [1.03-5.56]). In the worst-case scenario considered, a variant with the transmission and breakthrough characteristics of Omicron and the severity of Delta would result in 15.9 million (4.31-35.9) deaths, 14.3 million (3.33-32.7) more than a scenario where no new variant emerges. In China, the potential morbidity and mortality in 2023 is high, due to a combination of pandemic history and policy that has kept levels of population immunity to COVID-19 low. In our ""worst case"" variant scenario, we estimate initiatives to return mask use to 80% of the population (or the location-specific current level, if higher) as well as the reimplementation of moderate mandates would avert 32.8% (18.7-51.3) of the predicted deaths, with maximal impact occurring in the European region (44.8% [28.7-61.6]). In every variant scenario, given the estimated speed of global spread, we predict that variant-targeted mRNA boosters are not able to be deployed soon enough to have a substantial impact. While there is considerable uncertainty in the future of COVID-19 variant characteristics, this study demonstrates a range of plausible outcomes expected across a spectrum of future realities. Although it would require nations to react quickly to newly detected threats, our predictions show that increased mask use and (where necessary) reimplementation of moderate social distancing mandates can mitigate much of any future challenge.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

MethodsWe gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated.

ResultsAll ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journals formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing.

ConclusionChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

Tracing these evolutionary histories contextualises virus spill over events and may help to elucidate how and why they occur. We used a combination of total RNA sequencing and transcriptome data mining to extend the diversity and evolutionary history of the order Articulavirales, which includes the influenza viruses. From this, we identified the first instance of Articulavirales in the Cnidaria (including corals), constituting a novel and divergent family that we tentatively named the Cnidenomoviridae. This may be the basal group within the Articulavirales. We also extended the known evolutionary history of the influenza virus lineage by identifying a highly divergent, sturgeon-associated influenza virus. This suggests that fish were among the first hosts of influenza viruses. Finally, we substantially expanded the known diversity of quaranjaviruses and proposed that this genus be reclassified as a family (the Quaranjaviridae). We find evidence that vertebrate infecting Quaranjaviridae may have initially evolved in crustaceans before spilling into terrestrial Chelicerata (i.e., ticks). Together, our findings indicate that the Articulavirales has evolved over at least 600 million years, first emerging in aquatic animals. Importantly, the evolution of this order was not shaped by strict virus-host codivergence, but rather by multiple aquatic-terrestrial transitions and substantial host jumps, some of which are still observable today.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

However, for one of the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders, Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), patients only marginally differ from healthy individuals on the group-level. Whether Precision Psychiatry can solve this discrepancy and provide specific, reliable biomarkers remains unclear as current Machine Learning (ML) studies suffer from shortcomings pertaining to methods and data, which lead to substantial over-as well as underestimation of true model accuracy.

MethodsAddressing these issues, we quantify classification accuracy on a single-subject level in N=1,801 patients with MDD and healthy controls employing an extensive multivariate approach across a comprehensive range of neuroimaging modalities in a well-curated cohort, including structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Diffusion Tensor Imaging as well as a polygenic risk score for depression.

FindingsTraining and testing a total of 2.4 million ML models, we find accuracies for diagnostic classification between 48.1% and 62.0%. Multimodal data integration of all neuroimaging modalities does not improve model performance. Similarly, training ML models on individuals stratified based on age, sex, or remission status does not lead to better classification. Even under simulated conditions of perfect reliability, performance does not substantially improve. Importantly, model error analysis identifies symptom severity as one potential target for MDD subgroup identification.

InterpretationAlthough multivariate neuroimaging markers increase predictive power compared to univariate analyses, single-subject classification - even under conditions of extensive, best-practice Machine Learning optimization in a large, harmonized sample of patients diagnosed using state-of-the-art clinical assessments - does not reach clinically relevant performance. Based on this evidence, we sketch a course of action for Precision Psychiatry and future MDD biomarker research.

MethodsIn a retrospective cohort study, we estimated the 21-day post vaccination incidence of stroke among COVID-19 first dose vaccine recipients. We linked the Georgia Immunization Registry with the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry and the Georgia State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System data to assess the relative risk of stroke by vaccine type.

ResultsAbout 5 million adult Georgians received at least one COVID-19 vaccine from December 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022: 54% received BNT162b2, 41% mRNA-1273 and 5% Ad26.COV2.S. Those with concurrent COVID infection within 21 days post vaccine had an increased risk of ischemic (OR=8.00, 95% CI: 4.18, 15.31) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.11, 24.64) with no evidence for interaction between vaccine type and concurrent COVID-19 infection. The 21-day post vaccination incidence of ischemic stroke was 8.14, 11.14, and 10.48 per 100,000 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2.S recipients, respectively. After adjusting for age, race, gender, and COVID-19 infection status there was a 57% higher risk (OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.42) for ischemic stroke within 21 days of vaccination associated with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine compared to BNT162b2.

ConclusionsConcurrent COVID-19 infection had the strongest association with early ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke after first dose COVID-19 vaccination. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was associated with a higher risk of early post-vaccination ischemic stroke than BNT162b2.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

MethodsThe study included five prospective cohorts from four countries (Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the UK) with self-reported data on COVID-19 and symptoms of depression and anxiety during March 2020-March 2022. We calculated the prevalence ratio (PR) of depression and anxiety in relation to having a significant person with COVID-19 and performed a longitudinal analysis in the Swedish cohort to describe the temporal patterns of the results.

Results162,237 and 168,783 individuals were included in the analysis of depression and anxiety, respectively, of whom 24,718 and 27,003 reported a significant person with COVID-19. Overall, the PR was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.05-1.10) for depression and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03-1.13) for anxiety among significant others of COVID-19 patients. The respective PRs for depression and anxiety were 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.07) and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98-1.07) if the significant person was never hospitalized, 1.15 (95% CI: 1.08-1.23) and 1.24 (95% CI: 1.14-1.34) if the patient was hospitalized, 1.42 (95% CI: 1.27-1.57) and 1.45 (95% CI: 1.31-1.60) if admitted to the ICU, and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.22-1.46) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.22-1.51) if the significant person died. Individuals of hospitalized, ICU admitted, or deceased patients showed higher prevalence of depression and anxiety during the entire 12 months after the COVID-19 diagnosis of the significant person.

With newly-available datasets and primary sources reporting sex-segregated means and variances in adult body mass, we estimated statistically-determined rates of SSD in mammals, sampling taxa by their species richness at the family level.

While most of these sgRNAs are monocistronic, some viral mRNAs encode more than one protein. For example, the ORF3a sgRNA also encodes ORF3c, an enigmatic 41-amino acid peptide. Here, we show that ORF3c suppresses RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated immune activation and interacts with the signaling adaptor MAVS. In line with this, ORF3c inhibits IFN-{beta} induction. This immunosuppressive activity of ORF3c is conserved among members of the subgenus sarbecovirus, including SARS-CoV and coronaviruses isolated from bats. Notably, however, the SARS-CoV-2 delta and kappa variants harbor premature stop codons in ORF3c demonstrating that this reading frame is not essential for efficient viral replication in vivo. In agreement with this, disruption of ORF3c did not significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 replication in CaCo-2 or CaLu-3 cells. In summary, we here identify ORF3c as an immune evasion factor that suppresses IFN-{beta} induction, but is dispensable for efficient replication of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

The aim of this prospective study was to determine differences in LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) between athletes who did not have a history of LV dysfunction but had a positive COVID-19 test (PCAt) and healthy control (CON) athletes and relate them to symptoms during COVID-19.

MethodsWe performed 151 transthoracic echocardiographies in our high-performance laboratory. GLS was determined in four-, two-, and three-chamber views and assessed offline by a blinded investigator in 88 PCAt (35% women) at a median of two months after COVID-19 who trained at least three times per week with more than 20 MET per week and 52 CONs from the German national squad (38% women).

ResultsGLS was significantly lower (GLS -18.53{+/-}1.94% vs. -19.94{+/-}1.42%, p<0.001) and diastolic function significantly reduced (E/A 1.54{+/-}0.52 vs. 1.66{+/-}0.43, p=0.020; El 0.15{+/-}0.04 vs. 0.17{+/-}0.04, p=0.009; E/El 5.74{+/-}1.74 vs. 5.22{+/-}1.36, p=0.024) in PCAt.

Sequence-based predictions of protein structures have increased in accuracy with over 214 million predicted structures available in the AlphaFold database (AFDB). However, studying protein structures at this scale requires highly efficient methods. Here, we developed a structural-alignment based clustering algorithm - Foldseek cluster - that can cluster hundreds of millions of structures. Using this method we have clustered all structures in AFDB, identifying 2.27M non-singleton structural clusters, of which 31% lack annotations representing likely novel structures. Clusters without annotation tend to have few representatives covering only 4% of all proteins in the AFDB. Evolutionary analysis suggests that most clusters are ancient in origin but 4% seem species specific, representing lower quality predictions or examples of de-novo gene birth. Additionally, we show how structural comparisons can be used to predict domain families and their relationships, identifying examples of remote homology. Based on these analyses we identify several examples of human immune related proteins with remote homology in prokaryotic species which illustrates the value of this resource for studying protein function and evolution across the tree of life.

COVID-OUT was an investigator-initiated, multi-site, phase 3, randomized, quadruple-blinded placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT04510194). The design simultaneously assessed three oral medications (metformin, ivermectin, fluvoxamine) using two by three parallel treatment factorial assignment to efficiently share placebo controls and assessed Long Covid outcomes for 10 months to understand whether early outpatient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 with metformin, ivermectin, or fluvoxamine prevents Long Covid.

MethodsThis was a decentralized, remotely delivered trial in the US of 1,125 adults age 30 to 85 with overweight or obesity, fewer than 7 days of symptoms, and enrolled within three days of a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immediate release metformin titrated over 6 days to 1,500mg per day 14 days total; ivermectin 430mcg/kg/day for 3 days; fluvoxamine, 50mg on day one then 50mg twice daily through 14 days. Medical-provider diagnosis of Long Covid, reported by participant by day 300 after randomization was a pre-specified secondary outcome; the primary outcome of the trial was severe Covid by day 14.

ResultThe median age was 45 years (IQR 37 to 54), 56% female of whom 7% were pregnant. Two percent identified as Native American; 3.7% as Asian; 7.4% as Black/African American; 82.8% as white; and 12.7% as Hispanic/Latino. The median BMI was 29.8 kg/m2 (IQR 27 to 34); 51% had a BMI >30kg/m2. Overall, 8.4% reported having received a diagnosis of Long Covid from a medical provider: 6.3% in the metformin group and 10.6% in the metformin control; 8.0% in the ivermectin group and 8.1% in the ivermectin control; and 10.1% in the fluvoxamine group and 7.5% in the fluvoxamine control. The Hazard Ratio (HR) for Long Covid in the metformin group versus control was 0.58 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.88); 0.99 (95% CI 0.592 to 1.643) in the ivermectin group; and 1.36 in the fluvoxamine group (95% CI 0.785 to 2.385).

ConclusionsThere was a 42% relative decrease in the incidence of Long Covid in the metformin group compared to its blinded control in a secondary outcome of this randomized phase 3 trial.

The first vaccines were developed rapidly using spike mRNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles but required ultra-low storage and have had limited immunity against variations in spike. Subsequently, protein-based vaccines were developed which offer broader immunity but require significant time for development and use of an adjuvant to boost immune response. Here, exosomes were used to deliver a bi-valent protein-based vaccine, in which two independent viral proteins were used. Exosomes were engineered to express either SARS-CoV-2 Delta spike (Stealth X-Spike, STX-S) or the more conserved nucleocapsid (Stealth X-Nucleocapsid, STX-N) protein on the surface. When administered as single product (STX-S or STX-N) or in combination (STX-S+N), both STX-S and STX-N induced a strong immunization with the production of a potent humoral and cellular immune response. Interestingly, these results were obtained with administration of only nanograms of protein and without adjuvant. In two independent animal models (mouse and rabbit), administration of nanograms of the STX-S+N vaccine resulted in increased antibody production, potent neutralizing antibodies with cross-reactivity to other variants of spike and strong T-cell responses. Importantly, no competition in immune response was observed, allowing for delivery of nucleocapsid with spike to offer improved SARS-CoV-2 immunity. These data show that the StealthXTM exosome platform has an enormous potential to revolutionize vaccinology by combining the advantages of mRNA and recombinant protein vaccines into a superior, rapidly generated, low dose vaccine resulting in potent, broader immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

Current approaches divide cells into discrete groups or clusters and identify differentially expressed genes between corresponding groups. Here, we propose a method that operates without such grouping. Latent embedding multivariate regression (LEMUR) is based on a parametric mapping of latent space representations into each other and uses a design matrix to encode categorical and continuous covariates. We use the method to analyze a drug treatment experiment on brain tumor biopsies. We detect drug-induced gene expression responses affecting subsets of cells in a continuous latent space representation that does not require discrete categorization of the cells. Latent embedding multivariate regression is a versatile new approach for identifying differentially expressed genes from single-cell data of heterogeneous cell subpopulations or tissues under arbitrary experimental or study designs.

The enormous diversity and intricate organization of cells in the brain have so far hindered our understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of its functions. Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have allowed systematic mapping of the spatial organization of molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues1-3. However, these approaches have only been applied to a few brain regions1-11 and a comprehensive cell atlas of the whole brain is still missing. Here, we imaged a panel of >1,100 genes in [~]8 million cells across the entire adult mouse brain using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH)12 and performed spatially resolved, single-cell expression profiling at the whole-transcriptome scale by integrating MERFISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using this approach, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of >5,000 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters, belonging to [~]300 major cell types, in the whole mouse brain with high molecular and spatial resolution. Registration of the MERFISH images to the common coordinate framework (CCF) of the mouse brain further allowed systematic quantifications of the cell composition and organization in individual brain regions defined in the CCF. We further identified spatial modules characterized by distinct cell-type compositions and spatial gradients featuring gradual changes in the gene-expression profiles of cells. Finally, this high-resolution spatial map of cells, with a transcriptome-wide expression profile associated with each cell, allowed us to infer cell-type-specific interactions between several hundred pairs of molecularly defined cell types and predict potential molecular (ligand-receptor) basis and functional implications of these cell-cell interactions. These results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture of the brain and a valuable resource for future functional investigations of neural circuits and their dysfunction in diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

One of the reasons why the internal milieu of the GI system is poorly investigated is because visceral organs are difficult to access and monitor. To directly measure the influence of endoluminal markers of GI activity on the emotional experience, we asked a group of healthy male participants to ingest a pill that measured pH, pressure, and temperature of their GI tract while they watched video-clips that consistently induced disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or a control neutral state. In addition to the objective physiological markers of GI activity, subjective ratings of perceived emotions and visceral (i.e. gastric, respiratory and cardiac) sensations were recorded. We found that when participants observed fearful and disgusting video-clips, they reported to perceive not only cardiac and respiratory sensations but also gastric sensations, such as nausea. Moreover, we found that there was a clear relation between the physiology of the stomach and the perceived emotions. Specifically, when disgusting video-clips were displayed, the more acidic the pH, the more participants reported feelings of disgust and fear; the less acidic the pH, the more they reported happiness. Our findings suggest that gastric signals contribute to unique emotional states and that ingestible pills may open new avenues for exploring the deep-body physiology of emotions.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

We sought to quantify excess mortality by state and compare these rates to primary series vaccination completion levels.

MethodsObservational cohort, US and state-level data. Expected monthly deaths were modeled using pre-pandemic US and state-level data (2015-2020). Mortality data was accessed from CDC public reporting.

ResultsWe find that in a two-year period since the rollout of vaccines, the US recorded >874,000 excess deaths. Vaccination rates and excess mortality were most strongly correlated in first two periods before the Omicron variant.

ConclusionThe association between vaccination and lower excess mortality rates was strongest in 2021 and early 2022, prior to high population rates of infection-acquired immunity. The findings underscore the benefits of the rapid vaccination rollout campaign and the continued need to boost at-risk populations.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

We report here that certain monoclonal neutralizing antibodies against distinct epitopic regions of the receptor-binding domain of the spike can replace ACE2 to serve as a receptor and efficiently support membrane fusion and viral infectivity. These receptor-like antibodies can function in the form of a complex of their soluble immunoglobulin G with Fc-gamma receptor I, a chimera of their antigen-binding fragment with the transmembrane domain of ACE2 or a membrane-bound B cell receptor, indicating that ACE2 and its specific interactions with the spike protein are dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 entry.

Marburg virus is zoonotic, maintained in nature in Egyptian fruit bats, with occasional spillover infections into humans and nonhuman primates. Although rare, sporadic cases and outbreaks occur in Africa, usually associated with exposure to bats in mines or caves, and sometimes with secondary human-to-human transmission. Outbreaks outside of Africa have also occurred due to importation of infected monkeys. Although all previous Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been brought under control without vaccination, there is nevertheless the potential for large outbreaks when implementation of public health measures is not possible or breaks down. Vaccines could thus be an important additional tool and development of several candidate vaccines is under way. We developed a branching process model of Marburg virus transmission and investigated the potential effects of several prophylactic and reactive vaccination strategies in settings driven primarily by multiple spillover events as well as human-to-human transmission. Our results show a low basic reproduction number which varied across outbreaks, from 0.5 [95% CI: 0.05 - 1.8] to 1.2 [95% CI: 1.0 - 1.9] but a high case fatality ratio. Of six vaccination strategies explored, a combination of ring and targeted vaccination of high-risk groups was generally most effective, with a probability of controlling potential outbreaks of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85 - 0.91) compared with 0.65 (0.60 - 0.69) for no vaccination, especially if the outbreak is driven by zoonotic spillovers and the vaccination campaign initiated as soon as possible after onset of the first case.

Currently, effective treatment for tic disorders is an area of considerable unmet clinical need. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a home-administered neuromodulation treatment for tics involving the delivery of rhythmic pulse trains of median nerve stimulation (MNS) delivered via a wearable  watch-like device worn at the wrist. We conducted a UK-wide parallel double-blind sham-controlled trial for the reduction of tics in individuals with tic disorder. The device was programmed to deliver rhythmic (10Hz) trains of low-intensity (1-19 mA) electrical stimulation to the median nerve for a pre-determined duration each day, and was intended to be used by each participant in their home once each day, 5 days each week, for a period of 4 weeks. Between 18th March 2022 and 26th September 2022 135 participants (45 per group) were initially allocated, using stratified randomisation, to one of the following groups; active stimulation; sham stimulation; or a to waitlist (i.e., treatment as usual) control group. Recruited participants were individuals with confirmed or suspected TS/CTD aged 12 years of age or upward with moderate to severe tics. Researchers involved in the collection or processing of measurement outcomes and assessing the outcomes, as well as participants in the active and sham groups and their legal guardians were all blind to the group allocation. The primary outcome measure used to assess the  offline or treatment effect of stimulation was the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale - Total Tic Severity Score (YGTSS-TTSS) assessed at the conclusion of 4-weeks of stimulation. The primary outcome measure used to assess the  online effects of stimulation was tic frequency, measured as the number of tics per minute (TPM) observed, based upon blind analysis of daily video recordings obtained while stimulation was delivered. The results demonstrated that after 4-weeks stimulation, tic severity (YGTSS-TTSS) had reduced by 7.1 points (35% reduction) for the active stimulation group compared to 2.13/2.11points for the sham stimulation and waitlist control groups. The reduction in YGTSS-TTSS for the active stimulation group was substantially larger, clinically meaningful (effect size = 0.5), and statistically significant (p = 0.02) compared to both the sham stimulation and waitlist control groups, which did not differ from one another (effect-size = -0.03). Furthermore, blind analyses of video recordings demonstrated that tic frequency (tics per minute) reduced substantially (-15.6 TPM) during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation (-7.7 TPM). This difference represents a statistically significant (p < 0.03) and clinically meaningful reduction in tic frequency (> 25% reduction: effect-size = 0.3). These findings indicate that home-administered rhythmic MNS delivered through a wearable wrist-worn device has potential as an effective community-based treatment for tic disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

In this study, we utilized a single-cell Raman platform and artificial intelligence to analyze blood cells from 98 human subjects, including 61 ME/CFS patients of varying disease severity and 37 healthy and disease controls. Our results demonstrate that Raman profiles of blood cells can distinguish between healthy individuals, disease controls, and ME/CFS patients with high accuracy (91%), and can further differentiate between mild, moderate, and severe ME/CFS patients (84%).

The degree to which connectivity measurements alone can inform understanding of neural computation is an open question. Here we show that with only measurements of the connectivity of a biological neural network, we can predict the neural activity underlying neural computation. We constructed a model neural network with the experimentally determined connectivity for 64 cell types in the motion pathways of the fruit fly optic lobe but with unknown parameters for the single neuron and single synapse properties. We then optimized the values of these unknown parameters using techniques from deep learning, to allow the model network to detect visual motion. Our mechanistic model makes detailed experimentally testable predictions for each neuron in the connectome. We found that model predictions agreed with experimental measurements of neural activity across 24 studies. Our work demonstrates a strategy for generating detailed hypotheses about the mechanisms of neural circuit function from connectivity measurements. We show that this strategy is more likely to be successful when neurons are sparsely connected--a universally observed feature of biological neural networks across species and brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

However, their wide application has been largely limited by high cost and inconvenience in administration. Here, we developed an intranasal spray containing two synergetic human NAbs that could broadly neutralize the emerging Omicron variants in vitro. A unique synergetic neutralizing mechanism was identified that the two NAbs bound to exclusive epitopes on the RBD and structurally compensate each other in blocking the Spike-ACE2 interaction. Importantly, when given at low dosages for three consecutive days through the intranasal mucosal route, this cocktail showed significant improvement in the emergency preventive and therapeutic effects in hamsters challenged with authentic Omicron BA.1. Further, we performed an investigator-initiated trail in healthy volunteers (ChiCTR2200066525) to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of the antibody cocktail administrated as nasal spray. The nasal spray is generally safe and well tolerated without treatment related severe abnormal effects. The antibody cocktail nasal spray demonstrated nasal concentrations higher than the IC90 of neutralization activity against Omicron BA.4/5 even at 24 hours post dosing. Furthermore, nasal samples from the study subjects demonstrated potent neutralization activity against Omicron BA.4/5 in an ex vivo pseudovirus neutralization assay.

N-IgG seroprevalence remained at <7% until the last quartile (Q) of 2021. After the emergence of the omicron variant, N-IgG seroprevalence increased rapidly and was 31% in Q1/2022 and 54% in Q4/2022. Seroprevalence was highest in youngest age groups from Q2/2022 onwards. We estimated that 51% of the Finnish 18-85-year-old population had antibody-mediated hybrid immunity induced by a combination of vaccinations and infections by the end of 2022. In conclusion, major shifts in the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting population immunity could be observed by serological testing.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

We report complete genomic characterization of HPAI/H5N1 viruses in five species of marine mammals and seabirds (dolphins, sea lions, sanderlings, pelicans and cormorants) sampled since November 2022. All Peruvian viruses belong to the HPAI A/H5N1 lineage 2.3.4.4b, but they are 4:4 reassortants where 4 genomic segments (PA, HA, NA and MP) position within the Eurasian lineage that initially entered North America from Eurasia, while the other 4 genomic segments (PB2, PB1, NP and NS) position within the American lineage (clade C) that was already circulating in North America. These viruses are rapidly accruing mutations as they spread south. Peruvian viruses do not contain PB2 E627K or D701N mutations linked to mammalian host adaptation and enhanced transmission, but at least 8 novel polymorphic sites warrant further examination.

However, the cephalopod brain evolved independently from that of other highly visual species, such as vertebrates, and therefore the neural circuits that process sensory information are profoundly different. It is largely unknown how their powerful but unique visual system functions, since there have been no direct neural measurements of visual responses in the cephalopod brain. In this study, we used two-photon calcium imaging to record visually evoked responses in the primary visual processing center of the octopus central brain, the optic lobe, to determine how basic features of the visual scene are represented and organized. We found spatially localized receptive fields for light (ON) and dark (OFF) stimuli, which were retinotopically organized across the optic lobe, demonstrating a hallmark of visual system organization shared across many species. Examination of these responses revealed transformations of the visual representation across the layers of the optic lobe, including the emergence of the OFF pathway and increased size selectivity. We also identified asymmetries in the spatial processing of ON and OFF stimuli, which suggest unique circuit mechanisms for form processing that may have evolved to suit the specific demands of processing an underwater visual scene. This study provides insight into the neural processing and functional organization of the octopus visual system, highlighting both shared and unique aspects, and lays a foundation for future studies of the neural circuits that mediate visual processing and behavior in cephalopods.

Scalp hair is exceptionally variable across populations within Homo sapiens. Neither the function of human scalp hair nor the consequences of variation in its morphology have been studied within an evolutionary framework. A thermoregulatory role for human scalp hair has been previously suggested. Here, we present experimental evidence on the potential evolutionary function of human scalp hair and variation in its morphology. Using a thermal manikin and human hair wigs at different wind speeds in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment, with and without simulated solar radiation, we collected data on the convective, radiative, and evaporative heat fluxes to and from the scalp in relation to properties of a range of hair morphologies, as well as a naked scalp. We find evidence for a significant reduction in solar radiation influx to the scalp in the presence of hair. Maximal evaporative heat loss potential from the scalp is reduced by the presence of hair, but the amount of sweat required on the scalp to balance the incoming solar heat (i.e. zero heat gain) is reduced in the presence of hair. Particularly, we find that hair that is more tightly curled offers increased protection against heat gain from solar radiation.

SignificanceThe evolution of human scalp hair might be explained by thermoregulation pressures experienced in hot and arid environments. Bipedal posture and a hairless body may have necessitated the development of scalp hair to minimize heat gain from solar radiation, particularly in hominins with large brains. We used a thermal manikin and human-hair wigs to examine this thermoregulatory hypothesis. We found that scalp hair reduces heat gain from solar radiation; tightly curled hair is most protective. Specifically, our results show that hair protects the scalp from solar radiation while minimizing the amount of sweat required to offset heat gain, with tightly curled hair providing the most protection.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

Long COVID patients experienced a state of hyper-inflammation prior to chronic headache onset and maintained persistent inflammatory activation throughout the progression of chronic headache. Metabolomic analysis also revealed augmented arginine and lipid metabolisms, skewing towards a nitric oxide-based pro-inflammation. Furthermore, metabolisms of neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and GABA were markedly dysregulated during the progression of long COVID headache.

People with chronic respiratory disease have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than the general population therefore, we investigated the association between pre-existing chronic respiratory disease and risk of cardiovascular events following COVID-19 using routinely collected data from 56 million people in England.

MethodsPrimary and secondary care data from the English National Health Service and COVID-19-specific linked data were used to define a population of adults with COVID-19 between 01/01/2020-30/11/2021. Start of follow-up was from first COVID-19 diagnosis. Pre-existing chronic respiratory disease included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or pulmonary fibrosis prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Adjusted Cox Proportional Hazard regression was used to investigate the association between pre-existing chronic respiratory disease and risk of cardiovascular events. Secondary objectives investigated the impact of COVID-19 hospitalisation and vaccine dose on risk of cardiovascular outcomes.

FindingsA total of 3,670,455 people were included. People with pre-existing respiratory disease had a higher risk of cardiovascular events (adjusted HR 1.11, 95% confidence intervals 1.07-1.14), heart failure (1.15, 1.09-1.21), and pulmonary embolism (1.20, 1.11-1.30) compared with those without pre-existing respiratory disease. Regardless of pre-existing respiratory disease, the risk of cardiovascular events was lower with increasing COVID-19 vaccine dose.

InterpretationPeople with chronic respiratory disease have a higher risk of some cardiovascular outcomes but the risk might be explained by the underlying respiratory condition. Risk of cardiovascular events was lower with increasing COVID-19 vaccine doses regardless of pre-existing chronic respiratory disease.

Many transcription factors, including MYC, are translated in TGs. It was shown that translation of proteins in TGs enables the formation of protein complexes that cannot be established when these proteins are translated in the cytosol, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that MYC protein complexes that involve binding to the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of MYC are only formed when MYC is translated in TGs. TG-dependent protein complexes require TG-enriched mRNAs for assembly. These mRNAs bind to a new and widespread RNA-binding domain in neutral or negatively charged IDRs in several transcription factors, including MYC. RNA-IDR interaction changes the conformational ensemble of the IDR, enabling the formation of MYC protein complexes that act in the nucleus and control functions that cannot be accomplished by cytosolically-translated MYC. We propose that certain mRNAs have IDR chaperone activity as they control IDR conformations. In addition to post-translational modifications, we found a novel mode of protein activity regulation. Since RNA-IDR interactions are prevalent, we suggest that mRNA-dependent control of protein functional states is widespread.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

Our analysis focused on deep phenotyping of T cells, which play important roles in immunity against SARS-CoV-2 yet may also contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Our findings demonstrate that individuals with LC exhibit systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. This is evidenced by global differences in T cell subset distribution in ways that imply ongoing immune responses, as well as by sex-specific perturbations in cytolytic subsets. Individuals with LC harbored increased frequencies of CD4+ T cells poised to migrate to inflamed tissues, and exhausted SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. They also harbored significantly higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and in contrast to non-LC individuals, exhibited a mis-coordination between their SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses. Collectively, our data suggest that proper crosstalk between the humoral and cellular arms of adaptive immunity has broken down in LC, and that this, perhaps in the context of persistent virus, leads to the immune dysregulation, inflammation, and clinical symptoms associated with this debilitating condition.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

We studied the long term pulmonary sequelae in children who had SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis single center descriptive study conducted in a public sector tertiary care hospital in Northern India, from June, 2020 to October, 2021. We enrolled children aged 7-18 years admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection and followed them up for 6 months. A detailed interval history was taken and pulmonary function tests were performed after 6 months, using a spirometer. A convenience sample of 40 children was enrolled. There were 21 males and the median (IQR) age was 13 (10.75, 17) years.

ResultsThirty percent of children (n=12) had pulmonary function abnormalities, which was of restrictive pattern in all. Children who were underweight had higher odds of developing pulmonary dysfunction following SARS-CoV-2 infection [OR (95% CI) 5.13 (1.19, 22.11); P=0.028]. There were no significant association with age, sex, severity of initial infection and oxygen requirement during the initial infection. Three children had persistence of dyspnea during follow up.

ConclusionThis study is the one of the first Indian studies regarding the pulmonary sequelae in children. A possibility of long term sequelae should be considered in children with history of SARS-CoV-2, presenting with suggestive complaints.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

Using a convenience sample of 94,812 longitudinal RT-qPCR measurements from anterior nares and oropharyngeal swabs, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics of first vs. second infections, adjusting for viral variant, vaccination status, and age. Relative to first infections, second infections usually featured a lower peak viral concentration and faster clearance time, especially in individuals who received a vaccine dose between their first and second infection. Furthermore, a persons relative (rank-order) viral clearance time, compared to others infected with the same variant, was similar across first and second infections; that is, individuals who had a relatively fast clearance time in their first infection tended to also have a relatively fast clearance time in their second infection. These findings provide evidence that, like vaccination, immunity from a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection shortens the duration of subsequent acute SARS-CoV-2 infections principally by reducing viral clearance time. Additionally, there appears to be an inherent element of the immune response, or some other host factor, that shapes a persons relative ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 infection that persists across sequential infections.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

While neutralising antibody (NAb) responses correlate with protection against symptomatic and severe infection, the contribution of the T cell response to the resolution or progression of disease is still unclear. Optimal protective immunity may require activation of distinct immune pathways. As such, defining the contribution of individual T cell subsets to disease outcome is imperative to inform the development of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. To address this, we performed immunophenotyping of T cell responses in unvaccinated individuals, representing the full spectrum of COVID-19 clinical presentation.

MethodsSpectral cytometry was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Computational and manual analyses were used to identify T cell populations associated with distinct disease states through unbiased clustering, principal component analysis and discriminant analysis.

ResultsCritical SARS-CoV-2 infection was characterised by an increase in activated and cytotoxic CD4+ (CTL) cells of a T follicular helper (TFH) or effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA) phenotype. These CD4+ CTLs were largely absent in those with less severe disease. In contrast, those with asymptomatic or mild disease were associated with high proportions of naive T cells and reduced expression of activation markers.

ConclusionHighly activated and cytotoxic CD4+ T cell responses may contribute to cell-mediated host tissue damage and progression of COVID-19. Potential for induction of these detrimental T cell responses should be considered when developing and implementing effective COVID-19 control strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1679545274504

However, to date, there is no equivalent surrogate available for the decrease of neuronal activity (i.e., inhibition). Here, we developed an optogenetic-based biochemical screen in which population neural activities can be controlled by light with single action potential precision, followed by unbiased phosphoproteomic profiling. We identified that the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (pPDH) inversely correlated with the intensity of action potential firing in primary neurons. In in vivo mouse models, monoclonal antibody-based pPDH immunostaining detected neuronal inhibition across the brain induced by a wide range of factors including general anesthesia, sensory experiences, and natural behaviors. Thus, as an in vivo marker for neuronal inhibition, pPDH can be used together with IEGs or other cell-type markers to profile and identify bi-directional neural dynamics induced by experiences or behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

To reduce introgression of transgene and control reproduction, catfish species have been studied for upscaled disease resistance and intervening of reproduction to lower the potential environmental risks of introgression of escapees as transgenic animals. Taking advantage of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated system, we succeeded in integrating the cathelicidin gene from an alligator (Alligator sinensis; As-Cath) into the target luteinizing hormone (LH) locus of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) using two delivery systems assisted by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs), respectively. In this study, high knock-in (KI) efficiency (22.38%, 64/286) but low on-target was achieved using the ssODN strategy, whereas adopting a dsDNA as the donor template led to an efficient on-target KI (10.80%, 23/213). On-target KI of As-Cath was instrumental in establishing the LH knockout (LH-_As-Cath+) catfish line, which displayed heightened disease resistance and reduced fecundity compared to the wild-type sibling fish. Furthermore, implanting with HCG and LHRHa can restore the fecundity, spawnability and hatchability of the new transgenic fish line. Overall, we replaced the LH gene with an alligator cathelicidin transgene and then administered hormone therapy to gain complete reproductive control of disease-resistant transgenic catfish in an environmentally sound manner. This strategy not only effectively improves the consumer-valued traits, but also guards against genetic contamination. This is a breakthrough in aquaculture genetics to confine fish reproduction and prevent the establishment of transgenic or domestic genotypes in the natural environment.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

However, because these approaches only interrogate short sequences, it remains challenging to perform high throughput (HT) assays on constructs containing combinations of sequence elements arranged across multi-kb length scales. Overcoming this barrier could accelerate synthetic biology; by screening diverse gene circuit designs, ""composition-to-function"" mappings could be created that reveal genetic part composability rules and enable rapid identification of behavior-optimized variants. Here, we introduce CLASSIC, a generalizable genetic screening platform that combines long- and short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) modalities to quantitatively assess pooled libraries of DNA constructs of arbitrary length. We show that CLASSIC can measure expression profiles of >105 drug-inducible gene circuit designs (ranging from 6-9 kb) in a single experiment in human cells. Using statistical inference and machine learning (ML) approaches, we demonstrate that data obtained with CLASSIC enables predictive modeling of an entire circuit design landscape, offering critical insight into underlying design principles. Our work shows that by expanding the throughput and understanding gained with each design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle, CLASSIC dramatically augments the pace and scale of synthetic biology and establishes an experimental basis for data-driven design of complex genetic systems.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

This plethora of formats, sometimes complementary, and often redundant, poses many challenges to bioinformatics data analysts. They constantly need to find the best tool to convert their data into the suitable format, which is often a complex, technical and time consuming task. Moreover, these small yet important tasks are often difficult to make reproducible. To over-come these difficulties, we initiated BioConvert, a collaborative project to facilitate the conversion of life science data from one format to another. BioConvert aggregates existing software within a single framework and complemented them with original code when needed. It provides a common interface to make the user experience more streamlined instead of having to learn tens of them. Currently, BioConvert supports about 50 formats and 100 direct conversions in areas such as alignment, sequencing, phylogeny, and variant calling. In addition to being useful for end-users, BioConvert can also be utilized by developers as a universal benchmarking framework for evaluating and comparing numerous conversion tools. Additionally, we provide a web server implementing an online user-friendly interface to BioConvert, hence allowing direct use for the community.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

While the majority of bacterial viruses, phages, use chromosomally-encoded cell surface structures as receptors, plasmid dependent-phages exploit plasmid-encoded conjugation proteins, making their host range dependent on horizontal transfer of the plasmid. Despite their unique biology and biotechnological significance, only a small number of plasmid-dependent phages have been characterized. Here we systematically search for new plasmid-dependent phages using a targeted discovery platform, and find that they are in fact common and abundant in nature, and vastly unexplored in terms of their genetic diversity. Plasmid-dependent tectiviruses have highly conserved genetic architecture but show profound differences in their host range which do not reflect bacterial phylogeny. Finally, we show that plasmid-dependent tectiviruses are missed by metaviromic analyses, showing the continued importance of culture-based phage discovery. Taken together, these results indicate plasmid-dependent phages play an unappreciated evolutionary role in constraining horizontal gene transfer.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

However, there were limited attention has been given to the disease sequelae in the recovered COVID-19 patients.

MethodsHere, we profiled the urine proteome of a cohort of 29 COVID-19 patients in their disease onset and recovery period, including mild, severe, and fatal patients and survivors who recovered from mild or severe symptoms.

ResultsThe molecular changes in the COVID-19 onset period suggest that viral infections, immune response changes, multiple organ damage, cell injury, coagulation system changes and metabolic changes are associated with COVID-19 progression. The patients who recovered from COVID-19 still exhibited an innate immune response, coagulation system changes and central nervous system changes. We also proposed four potential biomarkers to monitor the whole progression period of COVID-19.

ConclusionsOur findings provide valuable knowledge about the potential molecular pathological changes and biomarkers that can be used to monitor the whole period of COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504

Alchemical methods can also be used to estimate the impact of amino acid mutations on protein:protein binding affinities, but these calculations can involve sampling challenges due to the complex networks of protein and water interactions frequently present in protein:protein interfaces. We investigate these challenges by extending a GPU-accelerated opensource relative free energy calculation package (Perses) to predict the impact of amino acid mutations on protein:protein binding. Using the well-characterized model system barnase:barstar, we describe analyses for identifying and characterizing sampling problems in protein:protein relative free energy calculations. We find that mutations with sampling problems often involve charge-changes, and inadequate sampling can be attributed to slow degrees of freedom that are mutation-specific. We also explore the accuracy and efficiency of current state-of-the-art approaches--alchemical replica exchange and alchemical replica exchange with solute tempering--for overcoming relevant sampling problems. By employing sufficiently long simulations, we achieve accurate predictions (RMSE 1.61, 95% CI: [1.12, 2.11] kcal/mol), with 86% of estimates within 1 kcal/mol of the experimentally-determined relative binding free energies and 100% of predictions correctly classifying the sign of the changes in binding free energies. Ultimately, we provide a model workflow for applying protein mutation free energy calculations to protein:protein complexes, and importantly, catalog the sampling challenges associated with these types of alchemical transformations.

When testing for DE in single-cell RNA sequencing data, current pipelines first assign cells into discrete clusters (or cell types), followed by testing for differences within each cluster. Consequently, the sensitivity and specificity of DE testing are limited and ultimately dictated by the granularity of the cell type annotation, with discrete clustering being especially suboptimal for continuous trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we present miloDE - a cluster-free framework for differential expression testing. We build on the Milo approach, introduced for differential cell abundance testing, which leverages the graph representation of single-cell data to assign relatively homogenous,  neighbouring cells into overlapping neighbourhoods. We address key differences between differential abundance and expression testing at the level of neighbourhood assignment, statistical testing, and multiple testing correction. To illustrate the performance of miloDE we use both simulations and real data, in the latter case identifying a transient haemogenic endothelia-like state in chimeric mouse embryos lacking Tal1 as well as uncovering distinct transcriptional programs that characterise changes in macrophages in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. miloDE is available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloDE.","NA","biorxiv",1679545274504
