Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Here, we investigated humoral recall responses and vaccine-mediated protection in Syrian hamsters immunized with the third-generation Comirnaty(R) Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, followed by infection with either antigenically closely (EG.5.1) or distantly related (JN.1) Omicron subvariants. Vaccination with YF17D vector encoding a modified Gamma spike (YF-S0*) served as a control for pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Our results show that both Comirnaty(R) XBB.1.5 and YF-S0* induce robust, however, poorly cross-reactive, neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses. In either case, total antibody and nAb levels increased following infection. Intriguingly, the specificity of these boosted nAbs did not match the respective challenge virus but was skewed towards the primary antigen used for immunization, suggesting a marked impact of antigenic imprinting; confirmed by antigenic cartography. Furthermore, limited cross-reactivity and rapid decline of nAbs induced by Comirnaty(R) XBB.1.5 with EG.5.1 and, more concerning, JN.1. raises doubts about sustained vaccine efficacy against recent circulating Omicron subvariants. Future vaccine design may have to address two major issues: (i) to overcome original antigenic sin that limits the breadth of a protective response towards emerging variants, and (ii) to achieve sustained immunity that lasts for at least one season.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

We characterized the magnitude, phenotype and clonal composition of CD8 T cell responses against 16 epitope specificities by ELISpot, flow cytometry as well as single-cell RNA, TCR and surface protein sequencing. To test the functionality of identified clonotypes, 106 T cell receptors (TCR) from five epitope-specific repertoires were re-expressed and tested for peptide sensitivity. While recruited repertoires were overall enriched for high-avidity TCRs, differential clonal expansion was not linked to fine avidity differences. Instead, maintenance of polyclonality ensured robustness in counteracting mutational escape of epitopes. Our findings on the induction and maintenance of high-functionality polyclonal T cell repertoires shed light on T cell quality as a neglected criterion in the assessment of vaccine immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

COMBINE revealed diverse synergistic and antagonistic interactions between epigenetic protein domains, including a potent KRAB-L3MBTL3 fusion that enhanced gene silencing up to 34-fold in dose-limited conditions and enabled robust bidirectional CRISPR perturbation. Inducible screening showed DNA methylation modifiers are essential for epigenetic memory, with distinct combinations driving long-term silencing, repression, or activation. Notably, we identified TET1-based combinations that induce hit-and-run upregulation for over 50 days, demonstrating long-term transcriptional activation. This systematic analysis of pairwise domain interactions provides a rich resource for understanding epigenetic crosstalk and developing next-generation epigenome editing tools.

For twenty years, the GENCODE consortium has developed reference annotations for the human and mouse genomes, becoming a foundation for biomedical and genomics communities worldwide. Nevertheless, collections of important yet poorly-understood gene classes like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) remain incomplete and scattered across multiple, uncoordinated catalogs, slowing down progress in the field. To address these issues, GENCODE has undertaken the most comprehensive lncRNAs annotation effort to date. This is founded on the manual annotation of full-length targeted long-read sequencing, on matched embryonic and adult tissues, of orthologous regions in human and mouse. Altogether 17,931 novel human genes (140,268 novel transcripts) and 22,784 novel mouse genes (136,169 novel transcripts) have been added to the GENCODE catalog representing a 2-fold and 6-fold increase in transcripts, respectively - the greatest increase since the sequencing of the human genome. Novel gene annotations display evolutionary constraints, have well-formed promoter regions, and link to phenotype-associated genetic variants. They greatly enhance the functional interpretability of the human genome, as they help explain millions of previously-mapped ""orphan"" omics measurements corresponding to transcription start sites, chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding sites. Crucially, our targeted design assigned human-mouse orthologs at a rate beyond previous studies, tripling the number of human disease-associated lncRNAs with mouse orthologs. The expanded and enhanced GENCODE lncRNA annotations mark a critical step towards deciphering the human and mouse genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

However, a recent study suggested that sea anemones and other cnidarians have three segregated germ layer identities, corresponding to the bilaterian germ layers (1). Here, we investigated, how the three germ layer identities are specified during early development of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. First, the mesodermal territory is specified at the animal pole at 6 hours postfertilization, followed by the specification of a ring of endodermal territory between mesoderm and ectoderm. We then assessed the role of beta-catenin, MAPK and Notch signaling pathways during mesoderm and endoderm formation. Our results show that the mesoderm is initiated by MAPK signaling and simultaneously restricted to the future oral side by mutually exclusive nuclear beta-catenin signaling. The mesodermal cells then express the Delta ligand, while the ectodermal cells express the Notch receptor. Inhibition of Notch signaling as well as ectopic expression of the Notch intracellular domain showed that endodermal tissue identity is induced by Notch signaling at the boundary between mesoderm and ectoderm. We propose a new model that outlines the different steps leading to the segregation of mesoderm and endoderm identities in Nematostella, confirming the presence of 3 distinct germ layer identities in this cnidarian. Notably, the observed crosstalk of MAPK, beta-catenin and Notch signaling in the specification of three germ layers in Nematostella is highly reminiscent to early stage gastrulae of sea urchins suggesting that triploblasty may predate the split of cnidarians and bilaterians.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Here we test whether findings from static visual paradigms translate to active, naturalistic vision. Utilizing head-stabilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye tracking data of 5 participants who freely explored thousands of natural images, we show that saccade onset, not fixation onset, explains most variance in latency and amplitude of the early sensory component M100. Source-projected MEG topographies of image and saccade onset were anticorrelated, demonstrating neural dynamics that share similar topographies but produce oppositely oriented fields.

Current high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies rely on intricate chip manufacturing and microfluidic systems to provide large-scale synthetic oligonucleotides, at the expense of low concentration and limited compatibility in the processing of longer DNA constructs assembly. Here, we report a microchip-based massive in parallel synthesis (mMPS), pioneering an identification-sorting-synthesis-recycling iteration mechanism to microchips for high throughput DNA synthesis. In comparison to microarray-based methods, we demonstrate that our method can increase the DNA product concentration by 4 magnitudes (to picomole-scale per sequence) and greatly simplifies the downstream processes for large-scale gene synthesis construction. By the construction of 1.97 million-diversity variant libraries that cover 1,254 human protein domains, we demonstrated the uniformity of the constructed variant libraries using mMPS-derived oligos is greatly improved, with amino acid distribution highly consistent as designed. In addition, by synthesizing 285 1kb-to-3kb genes with varying degrees of sequence complexity from previously reported strains A501 and 3DAC, potential ancestor of early archaea and bacteria, our result shows that the overall gene assembly success rate using mMPS-derived oligos is increased by 10-fold in comparison to other methods.

The insula was also consistently identified as indicating the severity of insomnia symptoms in depressive disorder. In contrast, findings for other regions related to insomnia symptoms in both depressive and anxiety disorders were generally inconsistent across studies, partly due to variations in methods and patient cohorts.

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Despite this well-known link, we still know little about underlying age-related epigenetic differences, which could help us better understand inter-individual variation in aging and the etiology, onset, and progression of age-associated disease. Dogs exhibit this negative correlation between size, health, and longevity and thus represent an excellent system in which to test the underlying mechanisms. Here, we quantified genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of 864 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. Age strongly patterned the dog epigenome, with the majority (66% of age-associated loci) of regions associating age-related loss of methylation. These age effects were non-randomly distributed in the genome and differed depending on genomic context. We found the LINE1 (long interspersed elements) class of TEs (transposable elements) were the most frequently hypomethylated with age (FDR < 0.05, 40% of all LINE1 regions). This LINE1 pattern differed in magnitude across breeds of different sizes- the largest dogs lost 0.26% more LINE1 methylation per year than the smallest dogs. This suggests that epigenetic regulation of TEs, particularly LINE1s, may contribute to accelerated age and disease phenotypes within a species. Since our study focused on the methylome of immune cells, we looked at LINE1 methylation changes in golden retrievers, a breed highly susceptible to hematopoietic cancers, and found they have accelerated age-related LINE1 hypomethylation compared to other breeds. We also found many of the LINE1s hypomethylated with age are located on the X chromosome and are, when considering X chromosome inactivation, counter-intuitively more methylated in males. These results have revealed the demethylation of LINE1 transposons as a potential driver of inter-species, demographic-dependent aging variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

We found significant theta-band activity across spatial scales during anticipation of a distractor, closely linked with underlying working memory dynamics, through decoding and cross-temporal generalization analyses. EEG particularly reflected reactivation of memory around the anticipated time of a distractor, even in the absence of stimuli. During this anticipated time, beta-band activity exhibited transiently enhanced intrahemispheric communication between the LPFC and occipitoparietal brain areas. These oscillatory phenomena were observed only when the monkeys successfully performed the task, implicating their possible functional role in mitigating anticipated distractors. Our results demonstrate that distractor anticipation recruits multiple oscillatory processes across the brain during working memory maintenance, with a key activity observed predominantly in the theta and beta bands.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Mitoribosomes are specific ribosomes found in mitochondria, which have been shown to be remarkably diverse across eukaryotic lineages. In plants, they possess unique features, including additional rRNA domains stabilized by numerous pentatricopeptide repeat proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of translation by plant mitoribosomes remain largely unknown. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to provide a high-resolution structural characterization of the flowering plant mitoribosome, in translating and maturation states. The structure reveals the mitoribosome bound to tRNA in the peptidyl site, along with a segment of mRNA and a nascent polypeptide. Moreover, we identify an extensive set of ribosomal RNA modifications that we confirmed by nanopore sequencing. Additionally, we observe a late assembly intermediate of the small ribosomal subunit, in complex with the RsgA assembly factor. This reveals how a plant-specific extension of RsgA blocks the mRNA channel to prevent premature mRNA association before complete small subunit maturation. Our findings elucidate key aspects of translation in flowering plant mitochondria, revealing its distinct features compared to other eukaryotic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages use crlRNAs to thwart CRISPR-Cas immunity by inhibiting Cas expression, or to block Abi by silencing an unprecedented RNA toxin that features consecutive proline codons. Remarkably, the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIF24 selectively inhibits Cas proteins loaded with host crRNAs/crlRNAs, while allowing those complexed with viral crlRNAs to synergistically block Abi responses, as viral crlRNAs have co-adaptively evolved shorter spacer sequences.

However, these TCR-T cells can cross-react with off-target peptides, leading to severe autoimmune toxicities. Current efforts focus on identifying TCRs with reduced cross-reactivity. Here, we show that T cell cross-reactivity can be controlled by the co-signalling molecules CD5, CD8, and CD4, without modifying the TCR. We find the largest reduction in cytotoxic T cell cross-reactivity by knocking out CD8 and expressing CD4. Cytotoxic T cells engineered with a CD8-to-CD4 co-receptor switch show reduced cross-reactivity to random and positional scanning peptide libraries, as well as to self-peptides, while maintaining their on-target potency. Therefore, co-receptor switching generates super selective T cells that reduce the risk of lethal off-target cross-reactivity, and offers a universal method to enhance the safety of T cell immunotherapies for any TCR.

The plasma membrane protein ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) actively promotes cell lysis by polymerizing into membrane embedded filaments that induce the formation of large plasma membrane lesions. Yet the signals controlling NINJ1 polymerization and the opening of membrane lesions remain unknown. Here we combine cell biology and biophysical measurements to characterize the steps preceding NINJ1-induced PMR in cells undergoing ferroptosis. Our results show that NINJ1 lesions form through a 2-step mechanism requiring oligomerization, which is triggered by signal 1, and subsequent lesion opening driven by signal 2, which we determine to be cell swelling without a concomitant increase in intracellular pressure. The close homologue NINJ2 polymerizes with similar kinetics to NINJ1 but fails to form lesions during cell swelling, further highlighting that oligomerization and PMR are distinct events. Chimeras between NINJ1 and NINJ2 show that the unstructured N-terminal region of NINJ1 controls lesion opening in response to cell swelling. In summary, our data establish a new 2-step model for NINJ1-driven necrosis in which initial oligomerization causes the formation of NINJ1 filaments that serve as weak links in the plasma membrane and can break once cell swelling causes a rise in membrane tension and mechanical stress.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

However, despite extensive research, a strictly biochemical mechanism for self-organization in Hydra remains elusive. In this study, we investigated mechanical stimuli and identified a positive feedback loop between Wnt signaling and tissue stretching. We developed a mathematical model of mechanochemical pattern formation in a closed elastic shell, representing regenerating Hydra epithelial spheroids. Our model explains how mechanical forces drive axis formation and predicts the organizer's location under various perturbations, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial dynamics involved. Validation by partially confining regenerating tissues showed that the organizer indeed forms in regions with the greatest stretching potential. This work highlights a novel mechanochemical mechanism for luminal epithelium patterning, suggesting that mechanical forces, in addition to biochemical signals, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration and axis specification. Our findings offer broader implications for the role of mechanical forces in tissue organization in various biological systems, opening new avenues for investigating mechanochemical feedback in development and regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Dysregulation of clusterin is linked to late-onset Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular pathology and cancer. Despite its prominent role in extracellular proteostasis, the chaperone mechanism of clusterin has remained unclear. Here we present crystal structures of human clusterin, revealing a discontinuous three-domain architecture. Structure-based mutational analysis demonstrated that two intrinsically disordered, hydrophobic peptide tails enable diverse clusterin activities. Resembling the N-terminal substrate binding regions of so-called small heat shock proteins, these sequences mediate clusterin's chaperone function in suppressing amyloid-beta tau and alpha-synuclein aggregation. In conjunction with highly conserved surface areas, the tail segments also participate in clusterin binding to very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and cellular uptake. Moreover, the disordered tails cooperate with an adjacent amphipathic helix in lipoprotein formation, but remain accessible for chaperone function in the lipoprotein complex. The remarkable versatility of these sequences allows clusterin to function alone or bound to lipid in maintaining solubility of aberrant extracellular proteins and facilitating their clearance by endocytosis and lysosomal degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Electrophysiology and photo-inhibition across multiple projection neuron types within the MOs-c revealed differential contributions of pyramidal tract and corticothalamic (CTMOs) output channels to action progression and hand-mouth coordination. Notably, CTMOs display sustained firing throughout RWD sequence and selectively enhance RWD-relevant activity in postsynaptic thalamus neurons, which also contribute to action coordination. CTMOs receive converging monosynaptic inputs from forelimb and orofacial sensorimotor areas and are reciprocally connected to thalamic neurons, which project back to the cortical network.

To identify pathways that are essential under fluoroquinolone stress and thus might represent novel targets to revitalize the use of this class of antibiotics, we performed genome-wide CRISPRi-seq screens to determine antibiotic-gene essentiality signatures. As expected, genes involved in DNA recombination and repair become more important under fluoroquinolone-induced DNA damage, such as recA, recJ, recF, recO, rexAB and ruvAB. Surprisingly, we also found that specific downregulation of the gene encoding the histidine kinase LiaS caused fluoroquinolone hypersensitivity. LiaS is part of the LiaFSR (VraTSR) three-component regulatory system involved in cell envelope homeostasis. We show that LiaS keeps the response regulator LiaR inactive, and that deletion of liaS causes hyperphosphorylation of LiaR and subsequent upregulation of the LiaR regulon. RNA-seq was used to refine the LiaR regulon, highlighting the role of the heat-shock response and the pleiotropic regulator SpxA2 in fluoroquinolone sensitivity. Activating the LiaR-regulon by the cell envelope-targeting antibiotic bacitracin synergized with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. This synergistic antibiotic combination restored sensitivity in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains in vitro. Importantly, bacitracin/levofloxacin combination therapy was also effective in vivo and improved the treatment of fluoroquinolone-resistant S. pneumoniae infection in a zebrafish meningitis model. Together, the approaches and findings presented here provides a starting point for identification and validation of potent combination therapies that could be used in the clinic to treat antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly polishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using Pacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly.

We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.

There is a consensus among quantitative geneticists that the G-matrix can evolve through ""deep"" time. Yet, quantitative genetic models for the evolution of the G-matrix are conspicuously lacking. In contrast, the field of macroevolution has several stochastic models for univariate traits evolving on phylogenies. However, despite much research into multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods, analytical models of how multivariate trait matrices might evolve on phylogenies have not been considered. Here we show how three analytical models for the evolution of matrices and multivariate traits on phylogenies, based on Lie group theory, Riemannian geometry and stochastic differential (diffusion) equations, can be combined to unify quantitative genetics and macroevolutionary theory in a coherent mathematical framework. The models provide a basis for understanding how G-matrices might evolve on phylogenies, and we show how to fit models to data via simulation using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Such models can be used to generate and test hypotheses about the evolution of genetic variances and covariances, together with the evolution of the traits themselves, and how these might vary across a phylogeny. This unification of macroevolutionary theory and quantitative genetics is an important advance in the study of phenotypes, allowing for the construction of a synthetic quantitative theory of the evolution of species and multivariate traits over ""deep"" time.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

While bacteria can either promote or inhibit cancer growth, intratumoral bacteria can also be engineered using synthetic biology to remodel the tumor microenvironment. Here, we engineered the probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) to express the human chemokine CXCL13, a critical component of germinal center (GC) formation. The GC reaction is a fundamental aspect of adaptive immunity by which antibody affinity develops in secondary lymphoid organs for defense against pathogens. Using orthotopic models of bladder cancer, engineered CXCL13-expressing EcN colonized bladder tumors and elicited GC responses in bladder tumor-draining lymph nodes after intravesical delivery. Furthermore, when combined with PD-1 blockade, engineered EcN amplified the antitumor antibody response and promoted long-term survival and protective immunity upon tumor rechallenge. Thus, we demonstrate that synthetically engineered CXCL13-expressing EcN can enhance the efficacy of PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by amplifying tumor-specific humoral immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Here we report a multivalent liposomal hydrogel depot vaccine technology comprising the receptor binding domain (RBD) of up to four relevant SARS and MERS coronavirus strains non-covalently displayed on the surface of the liposomes within the hydrogel structure. The multivalent presentation and sustained exposure of RBD antigens improved the potency, neutralizing activity, durability, and consistency of antibody responses across homologous and heterologous coronavirus strains in a naive murine model. When administrated in animals previously exposed to the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 antigens, liposomal hydrogels elicited durable antibody responses against the homologous SARS and MERS strains for over 6 months and elicited neutralizing activity against the immune-evasive SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron BA.4/BA.5. Overall, the tunable antigen-decorated liposomal hydrogel platform we report here generates robust and durable humoral responses across diverse coronaviruses, supporting global efforts to effectively respond to future viral outbreaks.

Progress and PotentialRapidly mutating infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV, and COVID-19 pose serious threats to human health. Yet, most vaccines still do not mount durable protection against mutagenic viruses and fail to induce broad responses to protect against emergent strains. Materials approaches to vaccine design, such as employing sustained delivery approaches or decorating nanoparticle constructs with multiple antigens, have shown promise in improving the breadth and potency of vaccines. Yet, these approaches typically require cumbersome chemistries and have not been explored in pre-exposed populations over clinically relevant time scales. Here, we report the development of an injectable liposomal hydrogel depot technology capable of prolonged presentation of multiple coronavirus antigens non-covalently coordinated on the surface of the liposomes forming the hydrogel structure. These hydrogels improve the potency, durability and breadth of vaccine response and are easy to fabricate, enabling the rapid design of next generation vaccines that confer protection against rapidly evolving pandemics.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Decades of neurophysiological experiments have shed light on how brain regions [e.g., medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus] encode the self's position and trajectory. However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928155

Currently, we have standard metrics for evaluating model performance (e.g., precision, recall, F1), but these to some extent overlook the ultimate aim of addressing the specific research question to which the model will be applied. As improving performance metrics has diminishing returns, particularly when data is inherently noisy, biologists are often faced with the conundrum of investing more time in maximising performance metrics at the expense of doing the actual research. This leads to the question: how much noise can we accept in our ML models?
C_LIO_LIHere, we start by describing an under-reported source of noise that can cause performance metrics to underestimate true model performance. Specifically, ambiguity between categories or mistakes in labelling of the validation data produces hard ceilings that limit performance metric scores. This common source of error in biological systems means that many models could be performing better than the metrics suggest.
C_LIO_LINext, we argue and show that imperfect models (e.g. low F1 scores) can still useable. We first propose a simulation framework to evaluate the robustness of a model for hypothesis testing. Second, we show how to determine the utility of the models by supplementing existing performance metrics with  biological validations that involve applying ML models to unlabelled data in different ecological contexts for which we can anticipate the outcome.
C_LIO_LITogether, our simulations and case study show that effects sizes and expected biological patterns can be detected even when performance metrics are relatively low (e.g., F1 between 60-70%). In doing so, we provide a roadmap for validation approaches of ML models that are tailored to research in ecology and evolutionary biology.

All CoVs encode for a macrodomain (Mac1) that binds to and removes ADP-ribose from target proteins. SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 promotes virus replication in the presence of interferon (IFN) and blocks the production of IFN, though the mechanisms by which it mediates these functions remain unknown. Mac1 inhibitors could help elucidate these mechanisms and serve as therapeutic agents against CoV-induced diseases. We previously identified compound 4a (a.k.a. MCD-628), a pyrrolo-pyrimidine that inhibited Mac1 activity in vitro at low micromolar levels. Here, we determined the binding mode of 4a by crystallography, further defining its interaction with Mac1. However, 4a did not reduce CoV replication, which we hypothesized was due to its acidic side chain limiting permeability. To test this hypothesis, we developed several hydrophobic derivatives of 4a. We identified four compounds that both inhibited Mac1 in vitro and inhibited murine hepatitis virus (MHV) replication: 5a, 5c, 6d, and 6e. Furthermore, 5c and 6e inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication only in the presence of IFN{gamma}, similar to a Mac1 deletion virus. To confirm their specificity, we passaged MHV in the presence of 5a to identify drug-resistant mutations and identified an alanine-to-threonine and glycine-to-valine double mutation in Mac1. Recombinant virus with these mutations had enhanced replication compared to WT virus when treated with 5a, demonstrating the specificity of these compounds during infection. However, this virus is highly attenuated in vivo, indicating that drug-resistance emerged at the expense of viral fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Coarse-grained computational models are especially valuable for studying such processes via simulation. Here, we present COCOMO2, an updated residue-based coarse-grained model that extends its applicability from intrinsically disordered peptides to folded proteins. This is accomplished with the introduction of a surface exposure scaling factor, which adjusts interaction strengths based on solvent accessibility, to enable the more realistic modeling of interactions involving folded domains without additional computational costs. COCOMO2 was parameterized directly with solubility and phase separation data to improve its performance on predicting concentration-dependent phase separation for a broader range of biomolecular systems compared to the original version. COCOMO2 enables new applications including the study of condensates that involve IDPs together with folded domains and the study of complex assembly processes. COCOMO2 also provides an expanded foundation for the development of multi-scale approaches for modeling biomolecular interactions that span from residue-level to atomistic resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

The long-term viability of small populations can be threatened by an extinction vortex a positive feedback loop between declining fitness and declining population size. Two distinct mechanisms can drive an extinction vortex: i) ineffective selection in small populations allows deleterious mutations to fix, driving mutational meltdown, and ii) fewer individuals produce fewer of the novel beneficial mutations essential for long-term adaptation, a mechanism we term mutational drought. We measure the relative importance of each mechanism, on the basis of how sensitive beneficial vs. deleterious components of fitness flux are to changes in census population size near the critical population size at which fitness is stable. We derive analytical results given linkage equilibrium, complemented by simulations that capture the complex linkage disequilibria that emerge under high deleterious mutation rates. Even in the absence of environmental change, mutational drought can be nearly as important as mutational meltdown. Real populations must also adapt to a changing environment, making mutational drought more important. A partial exception is that mutational drought is somewhat less important when the beneficial mutation rate is high, although its contribution remains substantial. The critical population size is driven substantially higher by linkage disequilibria between deleterious and beneficial mutations, which also increase (albeit modestly) the importance of mutational drought.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

To tackle this issue and present a promising use case, we test artificial genomes within the framework of population genetics and local ancestry inference (LAI).

We found that letter representations unfolded more slowly in blind than in sighted brains, with decoding peak latencies ~200 ms later in braille readers. Focusing on the blind group, we found that the format of neural letter representations transformed within the first 500 ms after stimulus onset from a low-level structure consistent with peripheral nerve afferent coding to high-level format reflecting pairwise letter embeddings in a text corpus. The spatiotemporal dynamics of the transformation suggest that the processing cascade proceeds from a starting point in somatosensory cortex to early visual cortex and then to inferotemporal cortex.

TXNIP deficiency results in dysregulated AA uptake, enhanced mTORC1 signaling, increased translation, accelerated quiescence exit, and proliferation. Fibroblasts derived from a patient with a novel homozygous loss-of-function mutation in TXNIP, associated with a severe inborn metabolic disease, also failed to downregulate SLC7A5-SLC3A2. These findings highlight TXNIP's role in controlling SLC7A5-SLC3A2 mediated AA acquisition with implications for metabolism and human health.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Here, integrating single-nucleus multiomic sequencing and deep learning, we show that hundreds of sequence features (motifs) divide into distinct sets associated with accessible genomes of specific cell type families. This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations. We propose that long-term stability of cell type families is maintained through genome access specified by conserved motif sets, or  vocabularies, whereas cell types diversify through flexible use of motifs within each set.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Why MHC-I is susceptible to capture via autophagy remains unclear. By synchronizing exit of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), we show that PDAC cells display prolonged retention of MHC-I in the ER and fail to efficiently route it to the plasma membrane. A capture-complex composed of NBR1 and the ER-phagy receptor TEX264 facilitates targeting of MHC-I for autophagic degradation, and suppression of either receptor is sufficient to increase total levels and re-route MHC-I to the plasma membrane. Binding of MHC-I to the capture complex is linked to antigen presentation efficiency, as inhibiting antigen loading via knockdown of TAP1 or beta 2-Microglobulin led to increased binding between MHC-I and the TEX264-NBR1 capture complex. Conversely, expression of ER directed high affinity antigenic peptides led to increased MHC-I at the cell surface and reduced lysosomal degradation. A genome-wide CRISPRi screen identified NFXL1, as an ER-resident E3 ligase that binds to MHC-I and mediates its autophagic capture. High levels of NFXL1 are negatively correlated with MHC-I protein expression and predicts poor patient prognosis. These data highlight an ER resident capture complex tasked with sequestration and degradation of non-conformational MHC-I in PDAC cells, and targeting this complex has the potential to increase PDAC immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

IME has been noted across diverse genes and organisms, but remains mysterious in many respects. For example, how does intron sequence affect the magnitude of IME? In this study, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to assess the effect of varying intron sequence on gene expression in a high-throughput manner, in human cells, using tens of thousands of synthetic introns with natural splice sites and randomized internal sequence. We observe that most random introns splice efficiently and enhance gene expression as well as or better than fully natural introns. Nearly all introns stimulate gene expression ~eight-fold above an intronless control, at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the primary mechanism acts to increase mRNA levels. IME strength is positively associated with splicing efficiency and with the intronic content of poly-uridine stretches, which we confirm using reporter experiments. Together, this work elucidates sequence determinants of IME from tens of thousands of random introns, and confirms that enhancement of gene expression is a general property of splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Utilising phylogeographic approaches, we reveal a multi-scale expansion process with both short and long-distance dispersal events, and diffusion velocities in line with human-mediated jumps. We identify forest cover, banana and cocoa cultivation, temperature, and human population density as key environmental factors associated with OROV range expansion. Using ecological niche modelling, we show that OROV circulated in areas of enhanced ecological suitability immediately preceding its explosive epidemic expansion in the Amazon. This likely resulted from the virus being introduced into simultaneously densely populated and environmentally favourable regions in the Amazon, such as Manaus, leading to an amplified epidemic and spread beyond the Amazon. Our study provides valuable insights into the dispersal and ecological dynamics of OROV, highlighting the role of human mobility in colonisation of new areas, and raising concern over high viral suitability along the Brazilian coast.","NA","medrxiv",1730498928156

While data-driven statistical and machine learning methods can identify patterns from omics data across multiple samples, they typically require a large number of samples and they often lack interpretability and alignment with existing biological knowledge. In contrast, knowledge-based network methods integrate molecular data with prior knowledge to provide results that are biologically interpretable, but they lack both a unified mathematical framework, leading to ad-hoc solutions specific to particular data types or prior knowledge, limiting their generalisability, and a common modelling interface for programmatic manipulation, restricting method extensions. Furthermore, existing methods generally cannot perform joint network inference across multiple samples or conditions, which restricts their capacity to capture shared mechanisms, making these methods more sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address these limitations, we introduce CORNETO (Constrained Optimisation for the Recovery of NETworks from Omics), a unified framework for knowledge-driven network inference. CORNETO redefines the joint inference task as a constrained optimisation problem with a penalty that induces structured sparsity, allowing for simultaneous network inference across multiple samples. The framework is highly flexible and supports a wide variety of prior knowledge networks - undirected, directed and signed graphs, as well as hypergraphs - enabling the generalisation and improvement of many network inference methods, despite their seemingly different assumptions. We demonstrate its utility by presenting novel extensions of methods for signalling, metabolism and protein-protein interactions. We show how these new methods improve the performance of traditional techniques on a diverse set of biological tasks using simulated and real data. CORNETO is available as an open-source Python package (https://github.com/saezlab/corneto), facilitating researchers in extending, reusing, and harmonising methods for network inference.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Here, we investigated the involvement of those neuropeptide systems in maternal aggression within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a central region of the reward and maternal circuits. Infusion of CRF or Urocortin3 (CRF- receptor 2 agonist), as well as an OXT receptor antagonist, reduced maternal aggression, suggesting a role in pup defence. Furthermore, the effects of CRF infusion in the NAcSh continued beyond the maternal defence test (MDT), reducing nursing and increasing self- grooming. Corroborating the involvement of the stress system in maternal aggression, colocalization of CRF and cFos immunoreactive cells were increased in response to the MDT, regardless of pup presence. In addition, MDT exposure increased intra-NAc OXT release in lactating rats, which could be also triggered by local retrodialysis of CRF, but not Urocortin3. However, both ligands of the CRF system elicited dopamine (DA) release in different dynamics. Crh-r1 were predominantly expressed in the medial NAc on medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN), but also in the rostral part on GABAergic interneurons. Crh-r2 were mainly expressed in the rostral NAc and its expression on GABAergic interneurons increased towards the caudal pole. Lastly, we identified CRF-enriched projections to the NAcSh descending from the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the paraventricular thalamus, among others. In conclusion, intra-NAcSh dampened CRF system activity and enhanced OXT system transmission are indispensable for successful pup defence. Any perturbations like increased CRF system signalling might activate compensatory mechanisms to ensure adequate maternal behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Variant Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) exists as several subtypes, which are key  writers of ubiquitylation on histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub), crucial for transcriptional repression during development and cell identity determination. The mechanism by which dynamic chromatin exploration by varia nt PRC1 complexes is coupled to ubiquitin writing is unknown. Here, we developed a single-molecule approach to directly observe chromatin interactions and ubiquitylation by PRC1. We find that variant PRC1 transiently samples chromatin until reaching a catalytically competent nucleosome-bound state, resulting in E2 recruitment and ubiquitin transfer. Variant PRC1 is weakly processive in ubiquitylating neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, activity differences between PRC1 subtypes, containing either a PCGF1 or PCGF4 subunit, result from distinct probabilities of achieving a catalytically competent state. Our results thus demonstrate that the dynamic formation of an active complex between variant PRC1, E2 and chromatin is the critical determinant of subtype-specific variant PRC1 activity.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Therefore, approaches targeting food preferences should be integral in counteracting the current epidemic. However, food preferences are affected by a multitude of factors and are usually resistant to changes later in life. Hence, we tested whether the food choices of preschool children can be changed by a child-appropriate interactive fairytale. We used two interactive stories: the first (experimental) story was about how two protagonists of similar age as the participants saved their hometown from being drained of color with the help of magic fruits or vegetables, while the second (control) story consisted of a similar plot that did not mention food. In Experiment 1, we used a crossover design with a one-week baseline measurement. After the experimental stories, healthy food choices (i.e., pieces of fruit vs. cookies, sweets, or cake) increased significantly relative to the one-week baseline, whereas no change was observed after the control story. In preregistered Experiment 2, we replicated these results with vegetables as healthy options using a random control design and investigated the longevity of the effects.

The molecular underpinnings of this transition have traditionally centered on zygotic chromatin remodeling and genome activation1,2, as their repression can prevent downstream processes of differentiation and organogenesis. Despite precedents that oxygen depletion can similarly suspend development in early embryos3-6, hinting at a pivotal role for oxygen metabolism in this transition, whether there is a bona fide chemical switch that licenses the onset of morphogenesis remains unknown. Here we discover that a mitochondrial oxidant acts as a metabolic switch to license the onset of animal morphogenesis. Concomitant with the instatement of mitochondrial membrane potential, we found a burst-like accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide (O2-) during fly blastoderm formation. In vivo chemistry experiments revealed that an electron leak from site IIIQo at ETC Complex III is responsible for O2- production. Importantly, depleting mitochondrial O2- fully mimics anoxic conditions and, like anoxia, induces suspended animation prior to morphogenesis, but not after. Specifically, H2O2, and not ONOO-, NO, or HO{middle dot}, can single-handedly account for this mtROS-based response. We demonstrate that depleting mitochondrial O2- similarly prevents the onset of morphogenetic events in vertebrate embryos and ichthyosporea, close relatives of animals. We postulate that such redox-based metabolic licensing of morphogenesis is an ancient trait of holozoans that couples the availability of oxygen to development, conserved from early-diverging animal relatives to vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

In anoxic environments, methane is known to be produced through hydrogenotrophic, acetoclastic or methylotrophic mechanisms. Methane production from hydrocarbons may also be important, especially in hydrocarbon-rich environments, like the Gulf of California, but the mechanism of this hydrocarbonoclastic methanogenesis remains unclear. The activity of consortia of anaerobic methane oxidizing (ANME) archaea and bacteria limits the release of methane to the atmosphere by consuming methane in anoxic environments globally. Here we used isotopic-labeling to track the conversion of hydrocarbons (hexadecane and naphthalene) to methane in enrichments from hydrothermally impacted, hydrocarbon-rich sediments from the Gulf of California. Methane was produced directly from hexadecane and naphthalene, in both the presence and absence of sulfate. We reconstructed metagenomic assembled-genomes (MAGs) from these experiments which revealed a mixture of bacteria dominated by Desulfobacteriota and Bacteroidota, and archaea dominated by Aeinigmarchaeota, Thermoplasmatota, and ANME group 2c. The ANME-2c were the only MAGs that encoded methyl coenzyme M reductases (McrA) and complete Wood-Ljungdahl pathways (WLP). This suggests that ANME-2c archaea may be involved in the production of methane along the seafloor, and that our understanding of the roles of these globally important microbes is not yet fully appreciated.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Antibiotics based on programmable antisense oligomers (asobiotics) offer an attractive solution to the ""arms-race"", as their specificity can be quickly updated and tailored to target resistant bacteria. In order to understand the genetic architecture of resistance to asobiotics, we employed laboratory evolution assays to identify mutations that decrease susceptibility to antisense peptide nucleic acid (PNA) against four major gram-negative pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We observed that the reduction in susceptibility upon asobiotics treatment was dependent on the specific cell penetrating peptide (CPP) being conjugated to the PNAs, suggesting that reduced uptake is a common adaptation strategy only against the (KFF)3-K CPP. We in fact observed that sbmA was frequently mutated in all tested species when treated with (KFF)3-K conjugated PNAs. We further identified mutations related to translation, peptide transport and cell envelope, which provide new hypotheses on cellular response to CPP-PNAs conjugates. Furthermore, for (RXR)4XB-acpP we observed a modest increase in resistance only when mutations in the PNA binding site were induced, which could easily be bypassed by changing the PNA sequence. These findings indicate that the specific identity of the CPP used plays a key role in determining its robustness against the evolution of resistance, and that laboratory evolution can illuminate the remaining gaps in our knowledge on the mechanisms of action of asobiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

Here, we placed managed bee colonies on conventional farms to assess their impact on arabica coffee yield, quality and market value, while also to evaluate colony health in coffee fields treated with field rates of thiamethoxam-based products. We show that supplementing farms with managed bees increased farmer income by enhancing coffee yield and beverage quality, which is rewarded by specialty coffee markets. Moreover, our field-based study reveals that, even when exposed to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, managed bee colonies exhibited no significant adverse effects on their health within coffee fields.

This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use an unsupervised, deep learning-based method to discover decision-related dynamics from the simultaneous activity of neurons in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while they accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., ""neural mode"") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the second regime corresponds to decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials neural activity, of a putative internal decision commitment time in that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5. It also captures trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The putative neurally-inferred commitment times (""nTc"") occurred at times broadly distributed across trials, and not time-locked to stimulus onset, offset, or response onset. Nevertheless, when trials were aligned to nTc, behavioral analysis showed that, as predicted by a decision commitment time, sensory evidence before nTc affected the subjects decision, but evidence after nTc did not. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process, and suggest the moment of commitment to be a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

This coordinate system is abstract - with the same grid cells encoding position across different sensory environments; and hierarchical - with grid modules of increasing spatial scale occupying increasingly ventral locations in the EC. Recent theories suggest that a similar abstract coordinate system could offer the same benefits to general memories that are not sequences drawn from a 2D surface. Here we show that an abstract hierarchical coordinate system supports arbitrary sequences in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL). In single-unit recordings from MTL, we find abstract, coordinate-like coding of a simple sequential memory task. In an fMRI experiment with more complex hierarchical sequences, we discover an abstract hierarchical representation in EC: the coordinate representations at distinct levels in the hierarchy are arranged on an anatomical gradient along the EC's anterior-posterior axis, homologous to the ventro-dorsal axis in rodents. These results therefore mirror the anatomical gradient of grid cells in the rodent EC but now for arbitrary non-spatial sequences. Together they suggest that memories are scaffolded on a hierarchical coordinate system using common neuronal coding principles, aligned to preserved anatomy, across domains and species.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

We demonstrate that decreased hepatic mitochondrial energy metabolism in liver-specific, heterozygous PGC1a mice results in reduced mitochondrial response to changes in {Delta}GATP and tissue ATP following fasting. These impairments in liver energy state are associated with larger and longer meals during chow feeding, impaired dose-dependent food intake inhibition in response to mixed and individual nutrient oral pre-loads, and greater acute fasting-induced food intake.

We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning.

Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms.

Tools such as standardized cognitive tests and symptom inventories have played a crucial role in informing neuroimaging studies, helping to uncover the underlying brain systems associated with these measures. Substantial strides have been taken in developing models, such as connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), that establish connections between external measures and the human connectome, offering insights into how the functional organization of the brain varies in relation to scores on external measures2-8.

Here, we depart from the conventional feed-forward approach and introduce a feed-back approach that allows testing of the tests. Since the inception of cognitive psychology over 60 years ago9,10, cognitive tests have been meticulously developed to measure specific components of cognition. These tests, which have undergone extensive validation11-16 and have been standardized and administered to millions, operate on explicit assumptions about the cognitive components they assess. Rather than using external tests to identify the circuits supporting test scores, we a priori define networks of interest and quantify the extent to which these circuits support the test measure. To demonstrate this, we define functional connectivity networks for six cognitive constructs and quantify their contribution to performance across a spectrum of standardized cognitive tests and clinical measures. Employing robust machine learning in a predictive modeling framework, we show how this approach can be used to select tests according to the networks they rely upon. This establishes a biologically grounded metric for test comparison.

This approach also yields a brain-driven process for forming composite tests by selecting test combinations that depend on the same proportional brain systems, or for a single network of interest, combining tests with the highest predictive power for that network. This brain-driven approach results in more robust behavioral assessments and enhanced predictive power for the network of interest. We illustrate how this methodology can be applied to evaluate the inclusion of specific sub-tests within a composite score, revealing instances where composite scores are reinforced or weakened by subtest inclusion in terms of the specificity of the brain network they interrogate.

The brain-test score modeling approach presented here provides a biologically driven approach to the selection of external cognitive and symptom measures directed at specific brain systems. It opens new avenues of research by providing a framework for the development of new tests and measures guided by quantitative brain metrics.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730498928156

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730498928156

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1730498928156
