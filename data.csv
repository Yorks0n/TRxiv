However, Acrs that are capable of inhibiting biotechnologically relevant CRISPR systems are relatively rare and challenging to discover. To overcome this limitation, we describe a highly successful, rapid, and generalisable approach that leverages de novo protein design to develop new-to-nature proteins for controlling CRISPR-Cas activity. Using CRISPR-Cas13 as a representative example, we demonstrate that AI-designed anti-CRISPRs (AIcrs) are capable of highly potent and specific inhibition of CRISPR-Cas13 proteins. We present a comprehensive workflow for design validation and demonstrate AIcrs functionality in controlling CRISPR-Cas13 activity in bacteria. The ability to design bespoke inhibitors of Cas effectors will contribute to the ongoing development of CRISPR-Cas tools in diverse applications across research, medicine, agriculture, and microbiology.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

To obtain the iron required for growth, many bacterial pathogens encode transporters capable of extracting the iron-containing cofactor heme directly from host proteins. Pathogenic E. coli and Shigella spp. produce the outer membrane transporter ChuA, which binds host hemoglobin and extracts its heme cofactor, before importing heme into the cell. Heme extraction by ChuA is a dynamic process, with the transporter capable of rapidly extracting heme from hemoglobin in the absence of an external energy source, without forming a stable ChuA-hemoglobin complex. In this work, we utilise a combination of structural modelling, Cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and phenotypic analysis to understand the mechanistic detail of this process. Based on this understanding we utilise artificial intelligence-based protein design to create binders capable of inhibiting E. coli growth by blocking hemoglobin binding to ChuA. By screening a limited number of these designs, we identify several binders that inhibit E. coli growth at low nanomolar concentrations, without experimental optimisation. We determine the structure of a subset of these binders, alone and in complex with ChuA, demonstrating that they closely match the computational design. This work demonstrates the utility of de novo-designed proteins for inhibiting bacterial nutrient uptake and uses a workflow that could be applied to integral membrane proteins in other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Here we report three-dimensional structures of three large ornate bacterial RNAs using cryogenic electron microscopy at resolutions of 2.9-3.1 Angstrom. Without precedent among previously characterized natural RNA molecules, Giant, Ornate, Lake- and Lactobacillales-Derived (GOLLD), Rumen-Originating, Ornate, Large (ROOL), and Ornate Large Extremophilic (OLE) RNAs form homo-oligomeric complexes whose stoichiometries are retained at concentrations lower than expected in the cell.

Extensive intra- and intermolecular A-minor interactions, kissing loops, an unusual A-A helix, and other interactions stabilize the three complexes. Sequence covariation analysis of these large RNAs reveals evolutionary conservation of intermolecular interactions, supporting the biological importance of large, ornate RNA quaternary structures that can assemble without any involvement of proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Some people in their eighties have cognitive abilities similar to many 30-year-olds, while others experience significant cognitive decline at a much younger age. The variation in age-related cognitive decline is not arbitrary. Several non-modifiable (e.g. genetic) and potentially modifiable (e.g. high blood pressure, smoking, and hearing loss) risk factors are associated with faster cognitive aging. Beyond these individual-level risk factors, a growing body of evidence has identified associations between cognitive impairment and social, economic, and environmental factors. These associations are even more pronounced in developing countries, notably because of greater disparities in education and socioeconomic status. However, people from these countries are rarely studied in scientific research: a citizen of a high-income country is 37 times more likely to appear in a study in top medical journals than a citizen of a low-income country. Here, we examine the association between sociodemographic factors and cognitive aging trajectories among 715,295 participants in 46 countries. Cognition is assessed using Sea Hero Quest, a spatial navigation video game that predicts spatial ability in the real world. We find that the social, economic, and environmental well-being of older adults, as measured by the Global AgeWatch Index (GAWI), is negatively associated with age-related decline in spatial ability. In particular, the GAWI Health and Environment subscores are strongly correlated with the effect of age on wayfinding performance. We also found that gender differences in spatial navigation skills increase with age, and even more so in countries with greater gender inequality, as estimated by the Gender Inequality Index. Our results show that cognitive aging must be understood as a dynamic, heterogeneous process that is strongly linked to potentially modifiable environmental and social factors.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

Here, we introduce Genomic Network Analysis (GNA), an analytic framework that applies the principles of network modelling to estimates of genetic overlap derived from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait. Extensive simulations establish GNA is well-powered for most GWAS. Application to a diverse set of traits demonstrate that GNA yields critical insight into the genetic architecture that demarcate genetically overlapping traits at varying levels of biological granularity.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

Zoonotic crossovers, with hemagglutinins mutated to enhance viral ability to use human 2-6-linked sialic acid receptors versus avian 2-3-linked ones, highlight the pandemic risk. To gain insight into these crossovers, we determined the cryo-EM structure of hemagglutinin from the zoonotic H5N1 A/Texas/37/2024 strain (clade 2.3.4.4b) in complex with a previously reported neutralizing antibody. Surprisingly, we found that the receptor-binding site of this H5N1 hemagglutinin was already occupied by an 2-3-linked sialic acid and that this glycan emanated from asparagine N169 of a neighboring protomer on hemagglutinin itself. This structure thus highlights recognition by influenza hemagglutinin of an auto 2-3-linked sialic acid from N169, an N-linked glycan conserved in 95% of H5 strains, and adds auto-glycan recognition to the complexities surrounding H5N1 zoonosis.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Multiple RV association tests are available to study the relationship between genotype and phenotype, but most are restricted to per-gene models and do not fully leverage the availability of variant-level functional annotations. We propose Genome-wide Rare Variant EnRichment Evaluation (gruyere), a Bayesian probabilistic model that complements existing methods by learning global, trait-specific weights for functional annotations to improve variant prioritization. We apply gruyere to WGS data from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Sequencing Project, consisting of 7,966 cases and 13,412 controls, to identify AD-associated genes and annotations. Growing evidence suggests that disruption of microglial regulation is a key contributor to AD risk, yet existing methods have not had sufficient power to examine rare non-coding effects that incorporate such cell-type specific information. To address this gap, we 1) use predicted enhancer and promoter regions in microglia and other potentially relevant cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons) to define per-gene non-coding RV test sets and 2) include cell-type specific variant effect predictions (VEPs) as functional annotations. gruyere identifies 15 significant genetic associations not detected by other RV methods and finds deep learning-based VEPs for splicing, transcription factor binding, and chromatin state are highly predictive of functional non-coding RVs. Our study establishes a novel and robust framework incorporating functional annotations, coding RVs, and cell-type associated non-coding RVs, to perform genome-wide association tests, uncovering AD-relevant genes and annotations.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

Unexpectedly, a subset of these deaminases exhibited a preference for 5-methylcytosine (5mC) over cytosine (C) in both mononucleotide and single-stranded DNA substrates. In a methylome sequencing workflow, preferential deamination of 5mC by these enzymes enabled direct conversion of methylated cytosine while completely eliminating any background deamination of unmodified cytosine. This direct conversion allows for precise identification of methylated sites at single-base resolution with unmatched sensitivity enabling broad applications for the simultaneous sequencing of genome and methylome.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others.

This is more likely to arise when the two SNPs are in relatively close proximity, so while true epistasis between nearby variants could be commonplace, in practice there is no reliable way of telling apart true epistatic signals from false positives. By considering the causes of phantom epistasis from a genealogy-based perspective, we leverage the rich information contained within reconstructed genealogies (in the form of ancestral recombination graphs) to address this problem. We propose a novel method for explicitly quantifying how likely it is that a given pairwise interaction is the result of phantom epistasis, which can be applied to pairs of SNPs regardless of the genetic distance between them. Our method uses only publicly-available data and so does not require access to the phenotypes and genotypes used for detecting interactions. Using simulations, we show that the method has good sensitivity at even low genetic distances (around 0.5cM), and demonstrate its power to detect phantom epistasis using real data from previous studies. This opens up the exciting possibility of distinguishing spurious interactions in cis from those reflecting real biological effects.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Our study reveals that, among these resources, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks the oxysterol-binding protein 1 (OSBP1) transporter to exploit the Golgi-bound phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) pool. This leads to a depletion of Golgi-resident PI4P, triggering the activation of the ATM DNA Damage Response (DDR) kinase in the cytoplasm. As such, ATM, typically anchored to PI4P at the Golgi in an inactive state, undergoes auto-phosphorylation and cytoplasmic release upon SARS-CoV-2-induced PI4P depletion. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of ATM auto-phosphorylation, which stabilizes its interaction with PI4P, significantly impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication. The requirement for PI4P and impact of ATM inhibition might be conserved across coronaviruses, as similar effects were observed with HCoV-229E. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-induced, cytoplasmic ATM pre-activation primes cells for an accelerated response to DNA damage, which might contribute to the severe outcomes of COVID-19 observed in cancer patients undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy. Therefore, this study uncovers a DNA damage-independent mode of ATM activation and highlights the potential of ATM inhibitors as therapeutic agents against COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

During development, DNA content remains constant but cell size evolves, necessitating a mechanism that scales chromosome compaction with cell size. In this study, we examined chromatin compaction in the developing Drosophila nervous system by analyzing the large neuronal stem cells and their smaller progeny, the ganglion mother cells. Using super-resolution 3D Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy and quantitative time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, we observed that nanoscale chromatin density during interphase scales with nuclear volume according to a power law. This scaling relationship is disrupted by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity, indicating that molecular cues rather than mechanical constraints primarily regulate chromatin compaction. Notably, this power law dependency is maintained into mitosis but the scaling exponent decreases, suggesting phase separation of chromatin events during mitotic compaction. We propose that the scaling of mitotic chromosome size relative to cell size depends on the power law behaviour of interphase chromatin volume, and that scaling of mitotic chromatin compaction is an emergent property of linear polymers undergoing phase separation with their solvent.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Recent advancements have enhanced the accessibility and efficiency of CpHMD, significantly reducing the performance overhead compared to traditional constant-protonation MD simulations. This chapter guides the reader through the application of CpHMD to investigate the pH-dependent behavior of Cationic Ionizable Lipids (CILs) - a critical component of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs), which are among the most promising platforms for drug delivery. LNPs, including those employed in mRNA-based vaccines, played a pivotal role in the global response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, underscoring their potential in modern medicine. The chapter begins with a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of LNPs and provides a step-by-step protocol for setting up simulations of membranes containing CILs to calculate their apparent pKa. This parameter is crucial for governing the in vivo behavior of LNPs, where precise control is essential to optimize delivery efficiency while minimizing toxicity. By showcasing the ability of CpHMD simulations to unravel the intricate relationship between pH-dependent protonation, membrane structure, and lipid distribution, this chapter highlights their potential to inform the rational design of novel LNP formulations.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

However, despite improvements in genome assembly, genome annotation (i.e. the identification of protein-coding genes) remains challenging, particularly for eukaryotic genomes: it requires combining several approaches (typically ab initio, transcriptomics, and homology search), each with its own pros and cons. Deciding which gene models to retain in a consensus is far from trivial, and automated approaches tend to lag behind laborious manual curation efforts in accuracy. Results Here, we present OMAnnotator, a novel approach to building a consensus annotation. OMAnnotator repurposes the OMA algorithm, originally designed to elucidate evolutionary relationships among genes across species, to integrate predictions from different annotation sources, using evolutionary information as a tie-breaker. We validated OMAnnotator by reannotating the Drosophila melanogaster reference genome and comparing it with the expert-curated reference and results from the automated pipelines BRAKER2 and EvidenceModeller. OMAnnotator produced a consensus annotation that outperformed each individual input and surpassed the existing pipelines. Finally, when applied to three recently published genomes, OMAnnotator gave substantial improvements in two cases, and mixed results in the third, which had already benefited from extensive expert curation. Conclusion We introduce an original, flexible, and effective approach to annotating genomes by integrating multiple lines of evidence. The method's robustness is underlined by its successful implementation in re-annotating recently published genomes, opening up new avenues in eukaryotic genome annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

While invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high communication bandwidth to assist and rehabilitate these patients, their invasiveness limits broader adoption.

MethodsWe developed a minimally invasive BCI system that balances safety and communication bandwidth to restore hand functions of tetraplegia patients. This system enables real-time, precise control of hand movements and hand function rehabilitation. A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patient with deficit hand functions was recruited in this study.

ResultsThe system required less than 10 minutes of calibration time and maintained an average grasping detection F1-score of 0.91 over a 9-month period of home use. With the assistance of the brain-computer interface, the patient can achieve a 100% success rate in object transfer tests, and successfully perform daily tasks involving hand functions. Additionally, the patient showed substantial neurological recovery through consecutive BCI training, regaining the ability to hold objects without BCI assistance. The patient exhibited a 5-point improvement in upper limb motor scores and a 27-point increase in the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Improvements in electrophysiological assessments point to a considerable recovery in impaired neural circuits.

C_LIO_LIHere, we attempt to conceptualise a general workflow associated with automated tools in ecology.

C_LIO_LIWe offer an accessible guide to support the ecological community in navigating and capitalising on rapid technological and methodological advances. We describe how different error types arise from both sensor-based monitoring and from classifiers themselves; how different error types are handled at each stage of the workflow; and finally, implications and opportunities associated with deciding on methods used at each step of the pipeline.

To examine how lineage origins shape their properties, we differentiated V2a neurons from hPSC-derived progenitors with distinct anteroposterior identities. Single-nucleus multiomic analysis revealed lineage-specific transcription factor motifs and numerous differentially expressed genes related to axon growth and calcium handling. Bypassing lineage patterning via transcription factor-induced differentiation yielded neurons distinct from both developmentally relevant populations and human tissue, emphasizing the need to follow developmental steps to generate authentic cell identities.

Over two-thirds of polar bears will be extinct by 2050 with total extinction predicted by the end of this century and understanding possible mechanisms of adaptation via genomic analyses and preservation are critical. Transposable elements (TEs) are parasitic mobile elements that may play a role in an adaptive response to environmental challenges. We analysed transcriptome data from polar bear sub-populations in North-East and South-East Greenland (NEG, SEG), who reside in cooler and warmer habitats respectively, to identify differentially expressed, divergent TE species, TE families and linked changes in gene expression with some overlapping significantly differentially expressed TEs and genes. We identified activity hotspots in the genome of regions with significantly differentially expressed TEs. LINE family TEs were the most abundant, and most differentially expressed and divergent in the SEG population compared to reference TEs.

Net1 mRNA accumulates at DEJ protrusion-like structures that interact with the basement membrane and connect to a mechanosensitive network of microfibrils. Disrupting Net1 mRNA localization in mouse epithelium alters DEJ morphology and keratinocyte-matrix connections, affecting tissue homeostasis. mRNA localization dictates Net1 protein distribution and its function as a RhoA GTPase exchange factor (GEF). Altered RhoA activity is in turn sufficient to alter the ultrastructure of the DEJ. This study provides a high-resolution in vivo view of mRNA targeting in a physiological context.

Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants.

A key functional role of any connectome is to constrain inter-neuronal signaling and to sculpt the flow of activity patterns across the nervous system. Connectomes therefore play a central role in the rapid tranmission of information about an organism's environment from sensory neurons to higher-order neurons for action planning and ultimately to effectors. Here, we use an abstract model of activity spread to investigate the connectome's role in shaping sensory cascades. Our model allows us to simulate the signaling pathways from sensors to the rest of brain, mapping the similarity of these pathways between different sensory modalities and identifying convergence zones--neurons that are activated simultaneously by different sensory modalities. Further, we considered two multisensory integration scenarios -- a cooperative case where different sensory modalities interacted to ""speed up"" (reduce) neurons' activation times and a competitive ""winner take all"" case, where different sensory streams vied for the same neural territory. Finally, we use a data-driven algorithm to partition neurons into different classes based on their behavior during the cascade simulations. Our work helps underscore the role of ""simple"" models for enriching connectome data, while offering a data-driven classification of neurons based on their joint connectional/dynamical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we characterized the diverse molecular landscape of pSI neurons, revealing significant differences in ion channels and hormone regulator genes that may underpin sex-specific aggression. Male GABAergic pSI neurons exhibited remarkable hyperexcitability due to increased Ih currents. Strikingly, modulating HCN1 expression not only adjusted this hyperexcitability but also influenced sexual dimorphism in aggression: silencing HCN1 in the GABAergic pSI neurons reduced male aggression, while its overexpression markedly heightened aggression in females. Furthermore, testosterone was shown to intensify aggression by upregulating HCN1 and remodeling pSI circuits. These findings provide detailed sex-specific molecular mechanisms underlying social behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

We recently identified spontaneous atherosclerosis in the Korat cat breed, characterized by severe hypercholesterolemia and clinical signs of congestive heart failure, ultimately leading to death. Histopathological examination revealed lesions similar to those observed in human atherosclerosis. Given the close genetic relationship among affected cats, we hypothesized a genetic basis for the condition. Methods: We expanded our sample recruitment and employed whole genome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with the condition. Results: We identified a homozygous XM_003981898.6:c.2406G>A variant specific to the cases in the LDLR gene. This variant is predicted to result in a premature stop codon, XP_003981947.3:p.Trp758*, leading to a truncated LDLR protein that lacks the last 108 amino acids, including the transmembrane and intracellular C-terminal domains. Genotyping this LDLR variant in an additional cohort of 309 Korat cats confirmed its segregation and revealed new affected cats for clinical follow-up. In silico analyses demonstrated that the identified variant appears optimal for gene-editing-based therapeutics. Conclusions: This is the first report of a spontaneous atherosclerosis animal model with an LDLR variant, the most common gene associated with familial hypercholesterolemia in humans. Given that PCSK9, another known hypercholesterolemia gene, has been lost in many mammalian genomes, including cats, our study provides an exciting double knockout model for human atherosclerosis. The affected Korats may also serve as a valuable model for DNA base editing therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

A prominent principle promoted over the last century is that brain activity consists of electrical field potentials that oscillate at different frequency bands. However, this principle has been challenged on several grounds. Specifically, increasing evidence suggests that in some cases brain oscillations are manifested as transient bursts rather than sustained rhythms. In this paper, we examine the hypothesis that rhythmicity (sustained vs. bursty) is an additional dimension in the organization of brain function. To test this hypothesis, we segmented the neurophysiological spectrum of 859 participants encompassing a dozen datasets across species, recording techniques, ages 18-88, brain regions, and cognitive states in both health and disease, according to a novel measure of rhythmicity. Together with computer simulations and brain stimulation, we found a universal spectral architecture divisible into two categories: high-rhythmicity bands associated with sustained oscillations and novel low-rhythmicity bands dominated by brief oscillatory bursts. This universal architecture reveals stable features of the brains mode of operation: sustained bands signify maintenance of ongoing activity, whereas transient bands signify the brains response to change. Rhythmicity specifies a powerful, replicable, and accessible feature-set for neuro-technology and diagnosis, as well as cross-species comparisons.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) seeks to prioritize chromosomally normal embryos for transfer based on genetic analysis of a biopsy of approximately five trophectoderm cells from blastocyst-stage in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. While modern PGT-A platforms classify these biopsies as aneuploid, euploid, or mosaic (possessing a mixture of normal and aneuploid cells), the underlying incidences of aneuploid, euploid, and mosaic embryos and the rates of meiotic and mitotic error that produced them remain largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we paired a recent method for embryo simulation with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to infer rates of meiotic and mitotic error that best explain published PGT-A data. By simulating from these posterior distributions, we also evaluated the chromosomal status of entire embryos. For a published clinical sample, we estimated a 39-43% probability of meiotic error per meiosis, as well as a 1.0-3.0% probability of mitotic error per mitosis, depending on assumptions about spatial clustering of aneuploid cells within mosaic embryos. In addition, our analyses suggest that less than 1% of blastocysts are fully euploid, and that many embryos possess low-level mosaic clones that are not captured during biopsy. These broad conclusions were relatively insensitive to potential misclassification of mosaic biopsies. Together, our work helps overcome the limitations of embryo biopsies to estimate the fundamental rates of cell division errors that are the main causes of human pregnancy loss.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

However, controversy has emerged regarding how many functional miRNAs are encoded in the genome, and to what extent non-regulatory products of RNA degradation have been mis-identified as miRNAs. Central to miRNA function is their capacity to associate with an Argonaute (AGO) protein and form an RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC), which mediates target mRNA suppression. We report that numerous miRNAs previously reported in EMT and cancer contexts, are not incorporated into RISC and are not capable of endogenously silencing target genes, despite the fact that hundreds of publications in the cancer field describe their roles. Apparent function can be driven through the expression of artificial miRNA mimics which is not necessarily reflective of any endogenous gene regulatory function. We present biochemical and bioinformatic criteria that can be used to distinguish functional miRNAs from mistakenly annotated RNA fragments.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Here, using immune cells as a model system for studying the relationship between aging and glycocalyx remodeling, we show that 2,6-linked sialic acid -- a terminal glycan epitope typically associated with inhibitory signaling -- becomes downregulated in T cells from older animals. This downregulation is tightly correlated with age-associated accumulation of effector T cells, which are decorated with little to no 2,6-linked sialic acids. T cell aging renders older individuals more vulnerable to infections and cancers. To understand the role of 2,6-linked sialic acids in T cell physiology, we generated a mouse model with T cell-specific deletion of the sialyltransferase gene St6gal1. The chronic depletion of 2,6-linked sialic acids led to naive T (TN) cells expansion in the periphery and premature T cell exhaustion. As a result, these mice were less able to control acute Listeria infection and chronic tumor growth. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway can partially restore the ability of St6gal1-deficient T cells to control tumor growth. Together, these data suggest that 2,6-linked sialic acids are critical for maintaining long-term T cell responsiveness, and the loss of 2,6-linked sialic acids may directly contribute to age-related T cell exhaustion.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

These plants acquire water and nutrients from their hosts through a specialized organ called the haustorium. A critical process in the formation and function of the haustorium involves cell wall modification. In this study, we identified and analyzed the evolutionary relationships of pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes in parasitic plants and other major land plant lineages. One particular PLL gene, denoted as PLL1 in parasitic Orobanchaceae, which our previous research identified as a potential key parasitism gene, belongs to the largest sub-clade of this gene family. To explore the role of PLL1 gene in parasitic Orobanchaceae further, we manipulated its transcript abundance during haustorium development in Triphysaria versicolor, a model species in parasitic Orobanchaceae, using both direct transformation of the parasite and host-induced-gene-silencing (HIGS). For HIGS, we generated transgenic hosts (Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana) carrying hairpin RNAs targeting the PLL gene in T. versicolor. Our results demonstrated that both methods effectively reduced the PLL1 expression in the haustorium of T. versicolor, leading to an increase in poorly adhered parasites. These findings highlight PLL1's crucial role in haustorium development in Orobanchaceae and may inform novel strategies towards parasitic weed management.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Pathogens secrete cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) to facilitate plant colonisation, but damaged, infected cells are often a source of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides that trigger host immunity. The mechanisms by which pathogens minimize the release of cell wall-derived oligosaccharides while colonizing the host remain to be elucidated. We combined biochemical, molecular genetics and transcriptomic analyses to functionally characterize a glycoside hydrolase (ZtGH45) from the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. ZtGH45 gene is expressed during the necrotrophic phase of the fungus, coinciding with an accumulation of wheat {beta}-1,3/1,4-mixed-linked glucan (MLG)-derived oligosaccharides. We show that overexpression of ZtGH45 enhances {beta}-1,3/1,4-glucan hydrolysis and the derived oligosaccharides trigger an immune response in wheat, which hinders Z. tritici virulence. The results demonstrate that tight regulation of ZtGH45 is critical for the infection process to prevent early accumulation of MLG oligosaccharides that would prematurely induce host immunity counterbalancing fungal virulence. We suggest that the balance between plant cell wall degradation by fungal CWDE and the release of immunogenic wall-derived oligosaccharides governs the outcome of host invasion by pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

They are found cross-linguistically and are tied to important language functions such as the pacing of information in discourse and swift turn-taking. We study the rate of IUs in 48 languages from every continent and from 27 distinct language families. Using a novel analytic method to annotate natural speech recordings, we identify a low-frequency rate of IUs across the sample, with a peak at 0.6 Hz, and little variation between sexes or across the life span. We find that IU rate is only weakly related to speech rate quantified at the syllable level (SR), and crucially, that cross-linguistic variation in IU rate is smaller than cross-linguistic variation in SR. Since SR was shown to be inversely related to information density quantified at the syllable level, we suggest that across languages, IUs are more balanced than syllables in their information content.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

C. elegans germ granules consist of at least seven distinct subcompartments, including P granules, Z granules, Mutator foci, SIMR foci, P-bodies, D granules and E granules. Among these condensates, the E granule, which is nonrandomly positioned within the germ granule, is required for the production of a specialized class of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, the mechanisms underlying E granule formation and its functional significance remain largely unexplored. In this study, via the use of TurboID- based proximity labeling technology combined with an RNAi-based reverse genetic screen, we identified two novel components of the E granule, EGC-2/C27B7.5 and EGC-3/F59G1.8, which initiate E granule assembly. The depletion of EGC-2 or EGC- 3 disrupts the perinuclear localization of the EGO and PICS complexes, both of which are enriched in E granules and are required for E-class siRNA and piRNA biogenesis, respectively. Small RNAomic analyses revealed that both EGC-2 and EGC-3 promote the production of 5 E-class siRNA, whereas prohibiting piRNA maturation. Taken together, our results elucidate the roles of EGC-2 and EGC-3 in maintaining E granule integrity and small RNA homeostasis, and suggest that intracellular condensation may exert distinct regulatory effects on different biological processes. Additionally, the combination of proximity labeling technology and reverse genetic screening provides a robust strategy for studying the assembly of biomolecular condensates.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

SRNAs play a key role in the male germ line in genome maintenance and repair, and particularly in response to environmental stress and the resulting increase in transposable element (TE) activity. Here, we investigated how the social environment (high competition, low competition) of male zebrafish Danio rerio affects small RNAs in sperm and how these are linked to gene expression and TE activity in their offspring. In a first experiment, we collected sperm samples after exposing males to each social environment for two weeks to test for differentially expressed sperm micro- (miRNA) and piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA). In a separate experiment, we performed in vitro fertilisations after one two-week period using a split-clutch design to control for maternal effects and collected embryos at 24 hours to test for differentially expressed genes and transposable elements. We developed new computational prediction tools to link sperm sRNAs with differentially expressed TEs and genes in the embryos. Our results support the idea that the molecular stress response in the male germ line has significant down-stream effects on the molecular pathways, and we provide a direct link between sRNAs, TEs and gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

We previously reported that Gpr17 ablation in the brain-gut axis leads to improved metabolic homeostasis, suggesting GPR17 antagonism could be developed for diabetes and obesity treatment. Here, we performed high throughput screening (HTS) and identified two new GPR17 antagonists (compound 978 and 527). Both compounds antagonized downstream Gi/o, Gq and {beta}-arrestin signaling with high selectivity for GPR17, but not the closely related purinergic and cysteinyl leukotriene receptors. The molecular mechanisms of antagonism were revealed through Schild analysis, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and homology modelling. Compound 978 and its analog (793) attenuated GPR17 signaling and promoted glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion in enteroendocrine cells. In summary, we identified selective GPR17 antagonists through HTS, which represent promising pharmacological tools for developing new therapeutic strategies in diabetes and obesity.

SignificanceOur work highlights the therapeutic potential of GPR17 antagonism in the treatment of diabetes and obesity by leveraging its role in metabolic regulation. In previous studies, we have shown that Gpr17 ablation improves metabolic homeostasis, and here we expanded our research by identifying two novel small molecule antagonists of GPR17 through high-throughput screening. The compounds inhibited multiple downstream signaling pathways of GPR17 with high selectivity over other closely related receptors. Of particular significance, compound 978 and its analogs not only attenuated GPR17 signaling but also increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, a critical hormone for glucose homeostasis and appetite regulation. These findings shed new light into the molecular mechanisms of GPR17 antagonism and introduce valuable pharmacological tools for further exploration of therapeutic strategies in diabetes and obesity.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

In Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, male gametogenesis mitosis is exceptionally rapid and divergent. Within 8 minutes, the haploid male gametocyte genome undergoes three replication cycles (1N to 8N), while maintaining an intact NE. Axonemes assemble in the cytoplasm and connect to a bipartite MTOC-containing nuclear pole and cytoplasmic basal body, producing eight flagellated gametes. The mechanisms coordinating NE remodelling, MTOC dynamics, and flagellum assembly remain poorly understood.

Here, we identify the SUN1-ALLAN complex as a novel mediator of NE remodelling and bipartite MTOC coordination during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. SUN1, a conserved NE protein, localizes to dynamic loops and focal points near nuclear spindle poles. ALLAN, a divergent Allantoicase-like protein, has a location like that of SUN1 at nuclear MTOCs. SUN1 and ALLAN form a unique complex, detected by live-cell imaging, ultrastructural expansion microscopy, and interactomics. Deletion of either SUN1 or ALLAN gene disrupts nuclear MTOC organization, leading to basal body mis-segregation, defective spindle assembly, and impaired kinetochore attachment, but axoneme formation remains intact. Ultrastructural analysis revealed nuclear and cytoplasmic MTOC miscoordination, producing aberrant flagellated gametes lacking nuclear material. Sun1 deletion also alters parasite lipid composition, underscoring its role in NE homeostasis. These defects block parasite development in the mosquito and transmission, highlighting the essential functions of this complex.

This study reveals a bipartite MTOC and a highly divergent mechanism of NE remodelling during Plasmodium male gametogenesis. The SUN1-ALLAN complex is an unusual adaptation of the LINC complex, in absence of canonical KASH-domain proteins in Plasmodium, providing new insights into the evolution of closed mitosis and highlighting potential targets for blocking malaria transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

The analysis inspired bilateral collaborations between annotation groups, including the one that lead to MANE Select transcripts. Here we have repeated our analysis with updated versions of the three reference coding gene sets. Superficially, little appears to have changed. Although there are slightly fewer genes predicted as coding overall, the three groups still disagree on the status of 2,606 annotated genes. However, a comparison without read-through genes and immunoglobulin fragments shows that the three reference sets have merged or reclassified more than 700 genes since the last analysis and that just 0.6% of Ensembl/GENCODE coding genes are not also annotated by the other two reference sets. We used eight features indicative of non-coding genes to examine the 21,873 coding genes annotated across the three reference sets. We found that more than 2,000 had one or more potential non-coding features. While some of these genes will be protein coding, we believe that most are likely to be non-coding genes or pseudogenes.

On the contrary, the development of cardiovascular drugs is experiencing a decline, largely due to the bottleneck in understanding the pathophysiology of various heart diseases and assessing the effects of drugs on healthy human hearts. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and the availability of cardiac cell types in vitro, has resulted in a surge in efforts to fabricate human cardiac models for disease modelling and drug discovery applications. Although numerous attempts evidence successful fabrication of 3 dimensional (3D) engineered heart tissues, the innate immune cell population of the myocardium - particularly cardiac macrophages, was until recently, overlooke. With increasing appreciation of the interactions between cardiomyocytes and macrophages in the myocardium, in this work, isogenic populations of cardiac resident-like macrophages and cardiomyocytes were generated using iPSCs, to understand the interactions between the two cell types in both 2D and 3D settings, and subjected to electric stimulation. After characterizing iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) in depth, the conditioning of iMacs to align to a cardiac resident macrophage-like phenotype in the presence of iCMs in 2D culture was explored. In co-culture with iCMs, iMacs upregulated known genes expressed by cardiac resident macrophages. Additionally, in co-culture with iMacs, iCMs displayed an elongated morphology, improved calcium function and an increase in known maturation genes such as the ratio between MYH7 and MYH6 as well as SERCA2. In a 2D setting, iMacs showed the ability to electrically couple with iCMs and facilitate synchronous beating in iCM cultures. The 2D characterisation was translated into an engineered cardiac tissue model, wherein, improvement in tissue characteristics in the presence of iMacs was demonstrated in terms of increased cell alignment, enhanced cardiomyocyte elongation, physiologically relevant beat rates and improved tissue compaction. Taken together, these findings may open new avenues to use iMacs in engineered cardiac tissue models, not only as an innate immune cell source, but also as a support cell type to improve cardiomyocyte function and maturation.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Despite transformative advances in dense extracellular recordings, the activity of most cortical neurons remains undetected. Small simulations with known neuron spike times offer critical ground truth data to improve spike sorting. Yet, current simulations underestimate neuronal heterogeneity and connectivity, which can potentially make spike sorting more challenging. We simulated recordings in a detailed large-scale cortical microcircuit model to link spike sorting accuracy to neuronal heterogeneity, evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art spike sorters and examine how spike sorting impacts the retrieval of information encoded in the cortical circuit. We found that modern spike sorters accurately isolated about 15% of neurons within 50 {micro}m of the electrode shank, which contrasts with previous simulated yields but agrees with experiments. Neurons were unresolved because their spike trains were either missed (undersampling) or, when detected, incomplete or merged with other units (assignment biases). Neuron isolation quality was influenced by both anatomical and physiological factors (selection bias), improving with increased neuron firing rate, spike spatial extent, for neurons in layer 5, and excitatory neurons. We exposed the network to various stimuli to dissociate the impact of these biases on its stimulus discrimination ability. Surprisingly, undersampling did not affect discrimination capacity, but selection and assignment biases nearly reduced it by half. These findings posit realistic models as a complementary method to evaluate and improve spike sorting and, hence, brain activity representations.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

A 3.16 [A] global resolution cryo-EM reconstruction reveals that distortion of the siRNA-target duplex at position 6 allows target RNA entry into the catalytic cleft and shifts Lysine-709, a previously unrecognized catalytic residue, into the active site. A pyrimidine at target nucleotide t10 positions another unrecognized catalytic residue, Arginine-710, for optimal cleavage. Expansion of the guide-target duplex major groove docks the scissile phosphate for hydrolysis and subsequent groove compression after position 16 permits target RNAs to exit the catalytic cleft. These findings reveal how hAgo2 catalyzes siRNA target hydrolysis, providing a high-resolution model for therapeutic design.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Here we show that MYST family histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex proteins including MOZ/KAT6A, HBO1/KAT7, and the common MOZ/HBO1 complex subunit BRPF1 associate with NUP98 FOs on chromatin and within condensates. MYST HATs are molecular dependencies in NUP98-rearranged (NUP98-r) leukemia, and genetic inactivation or pharmacologic inhibition of Moz and Hbo1 impairs NUP98-r cell fitness. MOZ/HBO1 inhibition decreased global H3K23ac levels, displaced NUP98::HOXA9 from chromatin at the Meis1 locus, and led to myeloid cell differentiation. Additionally, MOZ/HBO1 inhibition decreased leukemic burden in multiple NUP98-r leukemia xenograft mouse models, synergized with Menin inhibitor treatment, and was efficacious in Menin inhibitor-resistant cells.

Indeed, myside bias has become a particularly pernicious fact of societal cohesion, contributing to the propagation of fake news, to social polarization, and even to the replication crisis in experimental science. By contrast, relatively little is understood about either its neurocognitive underpinnings or its evolution, one reason for this being that the potential presence of myside bias-like tendencies in non-human animals has never been directly tested. Hence, in order to advance research in both of these directions, we designed a novel mouse model of everyday-like rule revision such that the dynamic model environment would be sufficient to call out myside bias-like behaviors providing that mice did indeed possess the particular kind of competing neurocognitive processes necessary for it to manifest. Here, we both validate that model and provide the first behavioral descriptions of myside confirmation bias-like deliberative profiles in a non-human animal. Notably, we observe that this bias does not manifest in a merely unreflective or heuristic/ system 1 manner but rather also emerges through and indeed increases deliberative behaviors, especially in contexts of low representational resolution. Several other parallels with findings from human studies of myside bias are also detailed in the discussion.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Analysis of the surface structure of mutant leaves revealed that the degree of water repellency in rice largely depends on the accumulation of cuticular wax. Meanwhile, although papillae differentiation contributes minorly to water repellency, it is suggested to play a crucial role in achieving superhydrophobicity. These morphological characteristics are regulated by at least five previously characterized genes. We also found that superhydrophobicity is present in ancestral species, is retained by most cultivated rice, and appears to have evolved independently of rice domestication. Understanding the mechanisms of water repellence and their applications should provide important insight into the natural design of water repellence, as well as a basis for future innovation.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Nevertheless, these acquisitions failed to introgress into Neanderthals when archaic and modern populations admixed after 350 kya, suggesting their exclusive link to the modern human niche or that Neanderthal's small population size hindered their spread.

While high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated detailed profiling of heterogeneous transcriptional responses to perturbations at the single-cell level, there remains a pressing need for computational models that can decode the mechanisms driving these responses and accurately predict outcomes to prioritize target genes for experimental design. Here, we present scLAMBDA, a deep generative learning framework designed to model and predict single-cell transcriptional responses to genetic perturbations, including single-gene and combinatorial multi-gene perturbations. By leveraging gene embeddings derived from large language models, scLAMBDA effectively integrates prior biological knowledge and disentangles basal cell states from perturbation-specific salient representations. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple single-cell CRISPR Perturb-seq datasets, scLAMBDA consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in predicting perturbation outcomes, achieving higher prediction accuracy. Notably, scLAMBDA demonstrated robust generalization to unseen target genes and perturbations, and its predictions captured both average expression changes and the heterogeneity of single-cell responses. Furthermore, its predictions enable diverse downstream analyses, including the identification of differentially expressed genes and the exploration of genetic interactions, demonstrating its utility and versatility.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

TE mobility can be mutagenic and is thought to contribute to genome evolution by altering genome structure and diversification. In C. elegans elevated temperature leads to desilencing of TEs in the germline, suggesting that environmental conditions could impact the integrity of inheritable genomes.

Such fibrinaloid microclots are also relatively resistant to fibrinolysis. The proteins that the amyloid microclots contained differed markedly both from the soluble proteome of typical plasma and that of normal clots, and also between the disease studies (an acute syndrome in the form of sepsis in an ITU and a chronic disease represented by Long COVID). Many proteins in the amyloid microclots were low in concentration in plasma and were effectively accumulated into the fibres, whereas many other abundant plasma proteins were excluded. The proteins found in the microclots associated with the diseases also tended to be themselves amyloidogenic. We here ask effectively the inverse question. This is: can the clot proteome tell us whether the clots associated with a particular disease contained proteins that are observed uniquely (or are highly over-represented) in known amyloid clots relative to normal clots, and thus were in fact amyloid in nature? The answer is in the affirmative in a variety of major coagulopathies, viz. venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, various cardiac issues, and ischaemic stroke. Galectin-3-binding protein and thrombospondin-1 seem to be especially widely associated with amyloid-type clots, and the latter has indeed been shown to be incorporated into growing fibrin fibres.

MethodsUsing a population-based panel study of 9,820 adult members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large, integrated healthcare system, we compared survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness with presence of an ME/CFS diagnosis in the electronic health record (EHR) to evaluate ME/CFS underdiagnosis.

ResultsOf those with survey-defined ME/CFS-like illness, an estimated 97.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1%-98.4%) did not have an ME/CFS diagnosis in the EHR. The group without EHR diagnosis was younger, less likely to identify as white non-Hispanic, and more likely to have developed fatigue in the past three years than the EHR diagnosed group. Both diagnosed and undiagnosed ME/CFS-like illness groups had significantly impaired physical, cognitive, and social functioning, and significantly worse mental health and anxiety than those without ME/CFS-like illness.

ConclusionME/CFS is underdiagnosed in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California healthcare system. Enhanced syndromic surveillance that characterizes patients with ME/CFS who have not been diagnosed has the potential to increase timely recognition of ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

Cryptosporidium is an intracellular parasite of intestinal epithelial cells, and a leading cause of diarrheal death and disease in infants worldwide. Despite this, very little is known about the cell biology of infection of this eukaryotic pathogen. Here, we designed and implemented a unique microscopy-based arrayed CRISPR-Cas9 screen to interrogate the effects of the loss of every protein-coding human gene on a Cryptosporidium infection. As the experimental readout is image-based, we extracted multiple phenotypic features of infection, including parasite growth, progression of the parasite to its sexual life stage, and recruitment of host actin to  pedestals beneath the parasite vacuole. Using this dataset, we discovered a tipping point in the host cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that controls Cryptosporidium infection. Parasite growth can either be inhibited or promoted by the intermediary metabolite squalene. A build-up of squalene in epithelial cells creates a reducing environment, with more reduced host glutathione available for uptake by the parasite. Because Cryptosporidium has lost the ability to synthesise glutathione, this uptake from the host cell is required for growth and progression through its life cycle. We demonstrate that this dependency can be leveraged for treatment with the abandoned drug lapaquistat, an inhibitor of host squalene synthase that has efficacy against Cryptosporidium in vitro and in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

C. elegans possesses an expanded repertoire of at least 19 AGOs functioning in an intricate gene regulatory network. Despite their crucial roles, little is known about the regulation of AGOs, and whether their expression levels, tissue specificity, and functions change in response to genetic perturbations or environmental triggers. Here, we report that PALS-22, a member of an unusually expanded protein family in C. elegans, acts as a negative regulator of antiviral RNAi involving the RIG-I homolog. The loss of pals-22 leads to enhanced silencing of transgenes and endogenous dsRNAs. We found that PALS-22 normally suppresses the expression of two AGOs, VSRA-1 and SAGO-2, which are activated by bZIP transcription factor ZIP-1. When pals-22 is eliminated, vsra-1 and sago-2 are upregulated. These AGOs in turn play key roles in defense against foreign genetic elements and intracellular pathogens, respectively. Surprisingly, while in pals-22 mutants immune genes functioning in the intracellular pathogen response (IPR) are upregulated, removing SAGO-2 or the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RRF-3 in these mutants leads to the downregulation of these genes. This observation contrasts with the typical gene-silencing role of siRNAs. Finally, by analyzing C. elegans wild isolates and lab reference strains, we demonstrate that PALS-22 regulates the expression of several germline AGOs, affecting germline mortality and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. In summary, PALS-22 is a key genetic node that balances the trade-off between immunity and germline health by modulating the functions of different AGOs, thereby shaping the outputs of the RNAi machinery and the dynamics of epigenetic inheritance.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

However, the underlying cis-regulatory genetic factors that contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and their impact on clinical phenotypes remain enigmatic. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to cis-regulatory variation in 361,119 peripheral blood mononuclear cells across 63 COVID-19 patients during acute infection, 39 samples collected in the convalescent phase, and 106 healthy controls. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping across cell types within each disease state group revealed thousands of cis-associated variants, of which hundreds were detected exclusively in immune cells derived from acute COVID-19 patients. Patient-specific genetic effects dissipated as infection resolved, suggesting that distinct gene regulatory networks are at play in the active infection state. Further, 17.2% of tested loci demonstrated significant cell state interactions with genotype, with pathways related to interferon responses and oxidative phosphorylation showing pronounced cell state-dependent variation, predominantly in CD14+ monocytes. Overall, we estimate that 25.6% of tested genes exhibit gene-environment interaction effects, highlighting the importance of environmental modifiers in the transcriptional regulation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Our findings underscore the importance of expanding the study of regulatory variation to relevant cell types and disease contexts and argue for the existence of extensive gene-environment effects among patients responding to an infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

This escape has been attributed to mutations in critical neutralizing antibody epitopes mainly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. Here we show that this notion is incomplete. We found that several broadly neutralizing human antibodies isolated over the past years retain an almost undiminished capacity for inhibitory targeting of RBDs of recent highly immunoevasive SARS-CoV-2 strains. Likewise, human sera collected during the pre-Omicron era from persons immunized with original Wuhan-based vaccines were found to contain abundant neutralizing activity targeted against the RBDs of modern Omicron variants. However, this unexpected neutralization sensitivity was observed only when these RBDs were incorporated into a mismatched spike protein backbone, whereas the corresponding native Omicron spike proteins were highly resistant against the same panel of antibodies and human sera. We conclude that changes occurring outside of the RBD and leading to altered conformational dynamics of the spike protein have played a key part in the viral evolution enabling SARS-CoV-2 to escape from neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved cryptic RBD epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Here, we introduce SynapseNet, a tool for the automatic segmentation and analysis of synapses in electron micrographs. It can reliably segment synaptic vesicles and other synaptic structures in a wide range of electron microscopy approaches, thanks to a large annotated dataset, which we assembled, and domain adaptation functionality we developed.

Tokenvizz is a novel tool for genomic analysis that enhances data discovery and visualization by combining GraphRAG-inspired tokenization with graph-based modeling. In Tokenvizz, genomic sequences are represented as graphs, where sequence k-mers (tokens) serve as nodes and attention scores as edge weights, enabling researchers to visually interpret complex, non-linear relationships within DNA sequences. Through a web-based visualization interface, researchers can interactively explore these genomic relationships and extract biologically meaningful insights about regulatory patterns and functional elements. Applied to promoter-enhancer interaction prediction tasks, Tokenvizz outperformed traditional sequential models while providing interpretable insights into genomic features, demonstrating the advantage of graph-based representations for biological discovery.

The reliability of these forecasts hinges on detailed knowledge of disease transmission across different population segments, which may be inferred from within-community transmission rates via proxy data, such as contact surveys and mobility data. However, these approaches are indirect, making it difficult to accurately estimate rare transmissions between socially or geographically distant communities. We show that the steep ramp up of genome sequencing surveillance during the pandemic can be leveraged to directly identify transmission patterns between communities. Specifically, our approach uses a hidden Markov model to infer the fraction of infections a community imports from other communities based on how rapidly the allele frequencies in the focal community converge to those in the donor communities. Applying this method to SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data from England and the U.S., we uncover networks of inter-community disease transmission that, while broadly reflecting geographical relationships, also expose epidemiologically significant long-range interactions. We provide evidence that transmission between regions can substantially change between waves of variants of concern, both in magnitude and direction, and analyze how the inferred plasticity and heterogeneity in inter-community transmission impact evolutionary forecasts. Overall, our study high-lights population genomic time series data as a crucial record of epidemiological interactions, which can be deciphered using tree-free inference methods.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

This chaperone function is critically important to proteostasis, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and associated with various protein misfolding diseases in humans4,5. Mechanistic insights into how sHSPs sequester destabilized clients have been limited due to the extreme molecular plasticity and client-induced polydispersity of sHSP/client complexes6-8. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the sHSP from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (mjHSP16.5) in both the apo-state and in an ensemble of client-bound states. The ensemble not only reveals key molecular mechanisms by which sHSPs respond to and sequester client proteins, but also provides insights into the cooperative nature of chaperone-client interactions. Engagement with destabilized client induces a polarization of stability across the mjHSP16.5 scaffold, proposed to facilitate higher-order assembly and enhance client sequestration capacity. Some higher-order sHSP oligomers appear to form through simple insertion of dimeric subunits into new geometrical features, while other higher-order states suggest multiple sHSP/client assembly pathways. Together, these results provide long-sought insights into the chaperone function of sHSPs and highlight the relationship between polydispersity and client sequestration under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Regrettably, this was accomplished only for individual, tissue-dissociated cells. High-plex spatial biology has begun to recover the x, y, and z-coordinates of single-cells, but typically at the expense of far less than whole transcriptome coverage. To solve this problem, Bruker Spatial Biology has accomplished a commercial-grade panel (CosMx(R) Spatial Molecular Imager Whole Transcriptome Panel (WTx)), using 37,872 imaging barcodes, capable of sub-cellular imaging of the entire human protein-coding transcriptome. The imaging barcodes are encoded with 156 bits of information (4 on-cycles and 35 dark-cycles per code), at a Hamming Distance of 4 from each other to achieve a very low false-code detection. Key to achieving this high-plex capability was the ability to manufacture imaging barcodes that require no in-tissue amplification (every barcode is manufactured under GMP to contain exactly 30 fluorescent dyes) and uniform, size-exclusion purified, extremely small imaging barcodes ([~] 20 nm). A detailed study of six different human FFPE tissue types was performed (Colon, Pancreas, Hippocampus, Skin, Breast, Kidney), yielding over 5.4 billion transcripts from 2.7 million cells. We counted over 1,550 transcripts-per-cell on average and observed 900 unique genes per cell (measured as the median). Single fixed-cells containing well over 10,000 subcellularly imaged transcripts were accomplished. Advancing single-cell imaging to the whole transcriptome level opens a single unified approach to accomplish essentially all single-cell experiments, both imaging and non-imaging. Depending upon the sample type (e.g. fixed-cells, organoids, tissue sections, etc.), the transcripts per cell and genes per cell measured using the whole transcriptome panel often exceeds that obtained by the highest-resolution single-cell RNA-seq, can be performed on a single 5 {micro}m FFPE tissue section, with no dissociation bias (every cell is counted). Pathway analysis within the tumor bed of a colon adenocarcinoma sample found evidence of enrichment in pathways suggestive of an aggressive tumor type, and localized ligand-receptor analysis showed spatially restricted patterns related to adhesion, migration, and proliferation. The high-dimensional whole transcriptome data is streamed directly to a cloud-based Spatial Informatics Platform, allowing for the scalable processing of millions-of-single-cells and billions-of-transcripts per operation. The WTx data are combined with high-resolution antibody-based cell-morphology imaging and data-driven machine-learning cell segmentation algorithms, to generate the most complete view of single cell and sub-cellular spatial biology that has ever been obtained.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

The analysis of the resulting data poses significant challenges due to their sparsity and large volume, and proper statistical methods are required to analyze and extract information from scRNA-Seq datasets. Sample classification based on gene expression data has proven effective and valuable for precision medicine applications. However, standard classification schemas are often not suitable for scRNA-Seq due to its unique characteristics, and new algorithms are required to effectively analyze and classify samples at the single-cell level. In this article, we introduce singleDeep, an end-to-end pipeline that streamlines the analysis of scRNA-Seq data training deep neural networks, enabling robust prediction and characterization of sample phenotypes.

To validate the effectiveness of singleDeep, we applied it to make predictions on scRNA-Seq datasets from different conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Alzheimers disease. Our results demonstrate strong diagnostic performance, validated both internally and externally. Moreover, compared with traditional machine learning methods applied to pseudobulk data, singleDeep consistently outperformed these approaches. In addition to prediction accuracy, singleDeep provides valuable insights into cell types and gene importance estimation for phenotypic characterization. This functionality provided additional and valuable information in our use cases. For instance, we corroborated that some interferon signature genes are consistently relevant for autoimmunity across all immune cell types in lupus. On the other hand, we discovered that genes linked to dementia have relevant roles in specific brain cell populations, such as APOE in astrocytes.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bipolar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank validated over 70% of testable associations.

Overall, our findings shed new light on the influence of POEs on diverse complex traits and align with the parental conflict hypothesis, providing compelling evidence for this understudied evolutionary phenomenon.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

Two of those proteins that contain tubulin polymerization-promoting protein (TPPP)-like domains, TLP1 and TLP2, bind to high curvature regions of the microtubule. TLP2, which contains two TPPP-like domains, is an unusually long protein that wraps laterally around half a microtubule and forms the bridge between the two microtubules. Moreover, we found that the conserved protein SPEF1 binds to both microtubule seams. In vitro, human SPEF1 not only binds to the microtubule seam but also crosslinks two parallel microtubules. Single-molecule microtubule dynamics assays indicate that SPEF1 stabilizes microtubules in vitro.

We utilized this framework to assess the energy of functional brain networks under cognitive control and to understand how energy is allocated across canonical functional networks during various cognitive control tasks. We extracted network energy from functional connectivity patterns of subjects who underwent fMRI scans during cognitive tasks involving working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility, in addition to task-free scans. We found that the energy of the whole-brain network increases when exposed to cognitive control tasks compared to the task-free resting state, which serves as a reference point. The brain selectively allocates this elevated energy to canonical functional networks; sensory networks receive more energy to support flexibility for processing sensory stimuli, while cognitive networks relevant to the task, functioning efficiently, require less energy. Furthermore, employing network energy, as a global network measure, improves the performance of predictive modeling, particularly in classifying cognitive control tasks and predicting chronological age. Our results highlight the robustness of this framework and the utility of network energy in understanding brain and cognitive mechanisms, including its promising potential as a biomarker for mental conditions and neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

When paired with selection, SCRaMbLE can quickly generate strains with phenotype improvements by diversifying gene arrangement and content in LoxPsym-containing regions. Here, we demonstrate how iterative cycles of SCRaMbLE can be used to reorganise synthetic genome modules and synthetic chromosomes for improved functional performance under selection. To achieve this, we developed SCOUT (SCRaMbLE Continuous Output and Universal Tracker), a reporter system that allows SCRaMbLEd cells to be sorted into a high diversity pool. When coupled with long-read sequencing, SCOUT enables high-throughput mapping of genotype abundance and correlation of gene content and arrangement with growth-related phenotypes. Iterative SCRaMbLE was applied here to yeast strains with a full synthetic chromosome, and to strains with synthetic genome modules encoding the gene set for histidine biosynthesis. Five synthetic designs for HIS modules were constructed and tested, and we investigated how SCRaMbLE reorganised the poorest performing design to give improved growth under selection. The results of iterative SCRaMbLE serve as a quick route to identify genome module designs with optimised function in a selected condition and offer a powerful tool to generate datasets that can inform the design of modular genomes in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

This report describes endogenous zebrafish hand2 Cre and CreERT2 drivers generated with GeneWeld CRISPR-Cas9 precision targeted integration.

Resultshand2-2A-cre and hand2-2A-creERT2 knock-ins crossed with ubiquitous loxP-based Switch reporters led to broad labeling in expected mesodermal and neural crest-derived lineages in cardiac, pectoral fins, pharyngeal arch, liver, intestine, and mesothelial tissues, as well as enteric neurons. Novel patterns of hand2 lineage tracing appeared in venous blood vessels. CreERT2 induction at 24 hours reveals late emerging hand2 progenitors in the 24 - 48 hour embryo contribute to the venous and intestinal vasculature. Induction in 3 dpf larva restricts hand2 lineage labeling to mesoderm-derived components of the branchial arches, heart, liver and enteric neurons.

Conclusionshand2 progenitors from the lateral plate mesoderm and ectoderm contribute to numerous lineages in the developing embryo. Later emerging hand2 progenitors become restricted to a subset of lineages in the larva. The hand2 Cre and CreERT2 drivers establish critical new tools to investigate hand2 lineages in zebrafish embryogenesis and larval organogenesis.

Heterogeneous expression, regulatory complexity, and redundancy offsetting the inhibition of individual proteins, complicate the assignment of targeted therapy. We combined flow cytometry  fingerprinting, immunofluorescence imaging, and computational modeling to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in DLBCL. The combined workflow predicted selective responses to BCL2 inhibition (venetoclax) and non-canonical NF-{kappa}B inhibition (Amgen16). Within the U2932 cell line we identified distinct resistance mechanisms to BCL2 inhibition in cellular sub-populations recapitulating intratumoral heterogeneity. Co-cultures with CD40L-expressing stromal cells, mimicking the tumor microenvironment (TME), induced resistance to BCL2 and BCLXL targeting BH3-mimetics via cell-type specific upregulation of BCLXL or MCL1. Computational models, validated experimentally, showed that basal NF-{kappa}B activation determined whether CD40 activation drove BH3-mimetic resistance through upregulation of RelB and BCLXL, or cRel and MCL1. High basal NF-{kappa}B activity could be overcome by inhibiting BTK to resensitize cells to BH3-mimetics in CD40L co-culture. Importantly, non-canonical NF-{kappa}B inhibition overcame heterogeneous compensatory BCL2 upregulation, restoring sensitivity to both BCL2-and BCLXL-targeting BH3-mimetics. Combined molecular fingerprinting and computational modelling provides a strategy for the precision use of BH3-mimetics and NF-{kappa}B inhibitors in DLBCL.

Key Points- TME-mimicking co-culture provides resistance to BH3-mimetics through BCLXL, which can be overcome by inhibition of non-canonical NF-{kappa}B.
- Multidisciplinary profiling reveals how high NF-{kappa}B activity leads to crosstalk, and BH3-mimetic resistance counteracted by BTK inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

In PDAC, both cell types stimulate macropinocytosis as an adaptive response to glutamine depletion. CAFs play a critical role in sculpting the tumor microenvironment, yet how adaptations to metabolic stress impact the stromal architecture remains elusive. In this study, we find that macropinocytosis functions to control CAF subtype identity when glutamine is limiting. Our data demonstrate that metabolic stress leads to an intrinsic inflammatory CAF (iCAF) program driven by MEK/ERK signaling. Utilizing in vivo models, we find that blocking macropinocytosis alters CAF subtypes and reorganizes the tumor stroma. Importantly, these changes in stromal architecture can be exploited to sensitize PDAC to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that metabolic stress plays a role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, and that this attribute can be harnessed for therapeutic impact.

However, the inability to read XNAs in a direct, high-throughput manner has been a significant limitation for xenobiology. Here we demonstrate that XNA-containing templates can be directly and robustly sequenced (>2.3 million reads/flowcell, similar to DNA controls) on a MinION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies to obtain signal data that is significantly distinct from DNA controls (median fold-change >6x). To enable training of machine learning models that deconvolve these signals and basecall XNAs along with natural bases, we developed a framework to synthesize a complex pool of 1,024 UB-containing oligonucleotides with diverse 6-mer sequence contexts and high XNA purity (>90% UB-insertion on average). Bootstrapped models to enable data preparation, and data augmentation with spliced XNA reads to provide high context diversity, enabled learning of a generalizable model to call natural as well as unnatural bases with high accuracy (>80%) and specificity (99%).

These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age-structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes.

To assist researchers with these tasks, we developed paramix, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applying paramix to a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary between paramix and several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found that paramix yielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-paramix methods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as the paramix approach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.

Author summaryResearchers use infectious disease models to understand trends in disease spread, including predicting future infections under different interventions. Constraints like data availability and numerical complexity drive researchers to group individuals into broad categories; for example, all working age adults might be represented as a single set of model compartments. Key epidemic parameters can vary widely across such groups. Additionally, model outcomes calculated using these broad categories often need to be disaggregated to a high resolution, for example a precise age at death for calculating years life lost, a key measure when estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions. To satisfy these needs, we present a software package, paramix, which provides tools to move between high and low resolution data. In this paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of paramix by comparing various methods of calculating deaths and years of life lost across broad age groups. For an analysis of an archetypal model, we find paramix best matches a high-resolution model, while the alternatives are substantially different.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219145

Here, we report on the identification of a previously unrecognized property of MYOD as repressor of gene expression, via E-box-independent chromatin binding within accessible genomic elements, which invariably leads to reduced chromatin accessibility. MYOD-mediated repression requires the integrity of functional domains previously implicated in MYOD-mediated activation of gene expression. Repression of mitogen-and growth factor-responsive genes occurs through promoter binding and requires a highly conserved domain within the first helix. Repression of cell-of-origin/alternative lineage genes occurs via binding and decommissioning of distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), which requires the N-terminal activation domain as well as two chromatin-remodeling domains and leads to reduced strength of CTCF-mediated chromatin interactions. Surprisingly, MYOD-mediated chromatin compaction and repression of transcription do not associate with reduction of H3K27ac, the conventional histone mark of enhancer or promoter activation, but with reduced levels of the recently discovered histone H4 acetyl-methyl lysine modification (Kacme). These results extend MYOD biological properties beyond the current dogma that restricts MYOD function to a monotone transcriptional activator and reveal a previously unrecognized functional versatility arising from an alternative chromatin recruitment through E-box or non-E-box sequences. The E-box independent repression of gene expression by MYOD might provide a promiscuous mechanism to reduce chromatin accessibility and repress cell-of-origin/alternative lineage and growth factor/mitogen-responsive genes to safeguard the integrity of cell identity during muscle progenitor commitment toward the myogenic lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from diseased liverworts in the wild successfully re-infected M. polymorpha in pure culture conditions, producing high in planta bacterial densities and causing prominent tissue maceration. Comparative genomic analysis of Marchantia-associated P. viridiflava identified core virulence machinery like the type-III secretion system (T3SS) and conserved effectors (AvrE and HopM1) that were essential for liverwort infection.

Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery.

The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets.

Availability and implementationOur method, LRGE (Long Read-based Genome size Estimation from overlaps), is implemented in Rust and is available as a precompiled binary for most architectures, a Bioconda package, a prebuilt container image, and a crates.io package as a binary (lrge) or library (liblrge).

Deep learning protein design approaches like ProteinMPNN have shown strong performance both in creating novel proteins or stabilizing existing ones. However, it is unlikely that the stability of the designs will significantly exceed that of the natural proteins in the training set, which are biophysically only marginally stable. Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition. Here we show that a retrained network on predicted proteins from hyperthermophiles, termed HyperMPNN, not only recovers this unique amino acid composition but can also be applied to proteins from non-hyperthermophiles. Using this novel approach on a protein nanoparticle with a melting temperature of 65{degrees}C resulted in designs remaining stable at 95{degrees}C. In conclusion, we created a new way to design highly thermostable proteins through self-supervised learning on data from hyperthermophiles.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

It is commonly assumed that cells respond to these gradients by migrating directionally towards the regions of highest ligand density. In contrast with this view, here we show that cells exposed to micropatterned fibronectin gradients exhibit a complex repertoire of trajectories, including directed haptotactic migration up the gradient but also linear oscillations and circles with extended periods of migration down the gradient. To explain this behavior, we developed a biophysical model of haptotactic cell migration based on a coarse-grained molecular clutch model coupled to persistent stochastic polarity dynamics. While initial haptotactic migration is explained by the differential friction at the front and back of the cell, the observed complex trajectories over longer time scales arise from the interplay between differential friction, persistence, and physical confinement. Overall, our study reveals that confinement and persistence modulate the ability of cells to sense and respond to haptotactic cues and provides a framework to understand how cells navigate complex environments.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

We show that, at the cellular level, dietary adaptations are primarily driven by anterior enterocytes, and that both the relative abundance and gene expression profiles of these cells have evolved in response to rapid dietary specializations. These dietary adaptations are driven by rapidly evolving cell population-specific genes, suggesting that alterations in epithelial cell specification programs and molecular makeup promote ecological diversification.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

The relative importance of standing genetic variation vs. de novo mutations in adaptation remains a fundamental question in evolutionary biology. Selection during domestication has been long used as a model to understand evolutionary processes, providing information not only on the phenotypes selected but also, in many cases, an understanding of the causal loci. Of the multiple causal loci that have been identified in maize, the selected allele can be found segregating in natural populations, consistent with their origin as standing genetic variation. The sole exception to this pattern is the well-characterized domestication locus tga1, which has long been thought to be an example of selection on a de novo mutation. Here, we use a large dataset of maize and teosinte genomes to reconstruct the origin and evolutionary history of tga1. We first estimated the age of tga1-maize using a genealogy-based method, finding that the allele arose approximately 41,000-49,000 years ago, predating the beginning of maize domestication. We also identify, for the first time, tga1-maize in teosinte populations, indicating the allele can survive in the wild. Finally, we compare observed patterns of haplotype structure and mutational age distributions near tga1 with simulations, finding that patterns near tga1 in maize better resemble those generated under simulated selective sweeps on standing variation. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that maize domestication likely drew upon standing genetic variation at tga1 and cement the importance of standing variation in driving adaptation during domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

However, rapid parameter scaling has been essential to the success of large language models in text and images, while similar scaling has not been attempted with Transformer architectures for cellular modeling. To produce accurate, transferable, and biologically meaningful representations of cellular systems, we develop AIDO.Cell, a pretrained module for representing gene expression and cellular systems in an AI-driven Digital Organism [1]. AIDO.Cell contains a series of 3M, 10M, 100M, and 650M parameter encoder-only dense Transformer models pre-trained on 50 million human cells from diverse tissues using a read-depth-aware masked gene expression pretraining objective. Unlike previous models, AIDO.Cell is capable of handling the entire human transcriptome as input without truncation or sampling tricks, thus learning accurate and general representations of the human cells entire transcriptional context. This pretraining with a longer context was enabled through FlashAttention-2, mixed precision, and large-scale distributed systems training. AIDO.Cell (100M) achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks such as zero-shot clustering, cell-type classification, and perturbation modeling.

The recent approval of TCR-gene-edited T cells for cancer therapy demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using pMHC recognition to eliminate cancer. However, identification and selection of TCRs from patient material is complex and influenced by the TCR repertoire of the donors used. To overcome these limitations, we here present a rapid and robust de novo binder design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, including RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2, to engineer minibinders (miBds) targeting the cancer-associated pMHC complex, NY-ESO-1(157-165)/HLA-A*02:01. By incorporating in silico cross-panning and molecular dynamics simulations, we enhanced specificity screening to minimise off-target interactions. We identified a miBd that exhibited high specificity for the NY-ESO-1-derived peptide SLLMWITQC in complex with HLA-A*02:01 and minimal cross-reactivity in mammalian display assays. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this miBd by integrating it into a chimeric antigen receptor, as de novo Binders for Immune-mediated Killing Engagers (BIKEs). BIKE-transduced T cells selectively and effectively killed NY-ESO-1+ melanoma cells compared to non-transduced controls, demonstrating the promise of this approach in precision cancer immunotherapy.

These three loci, Teosinte crossing barrier 1 (Tcb1), Gametophytic factor 1 (Ga1), and Ga2, each play a key role in preventing hybridization between populations and are proposed to maintain the barrier between domesticated and wild subspecies. Each locus encodes a matching pair of silk- and pollen-active pectin methylesterases (PMEs). To investigate the diversity and molecular evolution of these gametophytic factor loci, we identified existing and improved models of the responsible genes in a new genome assembly which contains active versions of all three loci. We then examined fifty-two assembled genomes from seventeen species to classify haplotype diversity and identify sites under diversifying selection during the evolution of the causal genes. We show that Ga2, the oldest of these three loci, was duplicated to form Ga1 at least 12 million years ago. Tcb1, the youngest locus, arose as a duplicate of Ga1 before or around the time of diversification of the Zea genus. We find evidence of positive selection during evolution of the functional genes at an active site in the pollen-expressed PME and predicted surface sites in both the silk- and pollen-expressed PMEs. The most common allele at the Ga1 locus is a conserved ga1 allele (ga1-O), which is non-coding due to conserved stop codons in full-length gene copies that are between 610 thousand and 1.5 million years old. We show that the ga1-O allele is associated with and likely generates 24-nt siRNAs in developing pollen-producing tissue, and these siRNAs map to functional Ga1 alleles. In previously-published crosses, the ga1-O allele associates with reduced function of the typically dominant functional alleles for the Ga1 and Tcb1 barriers. Taken together, this seems to be an example of a type of epigenetic trans-homolog silencing known as paramutation functioning at a locus controlling a reproductive barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males--but not females.

MethodsTo probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation.

ResultsChemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions.

ConclusionsThe CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Not only do TF concentrations fluctuate in time and from cell to cell, in each cell the actual binding and unbinding of TFs to promoters is also stochastic. However, how this  noise propagation from TFs to their targets determines the expression fluctuations in target genes of the same TF has so far not been quantitatively characterized. Here we use fluorescence time-lapse microscopy in combination with microfluidics and automated image analysis to quantitatively track the single-cell growth and gene expression dynamics of different target promoters of the LexA SOS response regulator in E. coli under mild DNA damage induced by the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP).

We find that, at the single-cell level, LexA target promoters exhibit stochastic bursts in protein production with specific quantitative characteristics. First, the durations of protein production bursts are short, identical for all promoters, and independent of CIP levels. Second, the heights of the production peaks are exponentially distributed for each promoter, and independent of CIP level, but with different average heights for different promoters. Third, the frequency of the production bursts increases with CIP level for all promoters, but differs across promoters.

Importantly, we show that these observations are inconsistent with popular  equilibrium models of bacterial gene regulation that assume that the dynamics of binding and unbinding of TFs is fast relative to the time-scale of TF concentration fluctuations. Instead, all observations can be quantitatively fit by a relatively simple model in which DNA damage events lead to short transient dips in LexA concentration, and an expression burst occurs in a cell whenever LexA unbinds from the target promoter during such a short dip in LexA concentration. Moreover, because these transient dips in LexA concentration occur on the same time-scale as the stochastic unbinding of LexA from promoters, the response of a target promoter to an individual DNA damage event is stochastic and depends in a complex manner on the strengths of its LexA binding sites and the duration of the event. Consequently, the expression levels of different LexA target genes in a given cell reflect distinct statistics of the frequency and durations of DNA damage events in the recent history of that cell.

Our results show that, even in the simple scenario where a single TF is induced, different target promoters can exhibit distinct stochastic responses that depend on the precise kinetics of the induction events.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to multisystem deficits, including those affecting the nervous system. Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra. This synergy appears toxin-dependent since we do not observe this following exposure to the direct redox-inducing compound paraquat. This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein- based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA- based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from {approx}2% to {approx}70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219145

It is critical to ascertain how this virus has specifically adapted to bovine cells and the molecular determinants of this process. Here, we focused on the contribution of the viral ""internal"" genomic segments of H5N1 B3.13 to bovine cells adaptation. We generated 45 reassortant viruses harbouring the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 and internal gene constellations from several influenza A viruses (IAV) or carrying segment swaps between distinct H5N1 strains. The recombinant B3.13 viruses displayed faster replication kinetics in bovine cells compared to other IAV. Importantly, multiple genomic segments of B3.13 viruses contribute to their faster replicative fitness. Further, recombinants with the B3.13 internal genes were less susceptible than ancestral 2.3.4.4b strain to the bovine IFN response. However, bovine (and human) MX1, a key restriction factor for avian IAV, restricted both ancestral 2.3.4.4b and B3.13 recombinant viruses. Interestingly, the latter escape restriction from human BTN3A3. Finally, recombinant B3.13 was virulent in mice unlike the ancestor 2.3.4.4b recombinant virus.

For instance, endocrine islet beta ({beta}) cell secretion of insulin or cholecystokinin (CCK) promotes progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), an exocrine cell-derived tumor. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern endocrine-exocrine signaling in tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. We find that {beta} cell ablation impedes PDAC development in mice, arguing that the endocrine pancreas is critical for exocrine tumorigenesis. Conversely, obesity induces {beta} cell hormone dysregulation, alters CCK-dependent peri-islet exocrine cell transcriptional states, and enhances islet proximal tumor formation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, in silico latent-space archetypal and trajectory analysis, and genetic lineage tracing in vivo reveal that obesity stimulates postnatal immature {beta} cell expansion and adaptation towards a pro-tumorigenic CCK+ state via JNK/cJun stress-responsive signaling. These results define endocrine-exocrine signaling as a driver of PDAC development and uncover new avenues to target the endocrine pancreas to subvert exocrine tumorigenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1733782219146

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219146

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MethodsThis phase 3, open-label study (2019nCoV-312/NCT05875701) enrolled participants who received one dose of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in an earlier study (2019nCoV-307/NCT05463068) after a primary series and possibly one additional dose of mRNA vaccine. In the current study, participants received an additional dose of protein-based vaccine (ancestral [n=104] or Omicron BA.5 [n=40]) at least 180 days after their previous study dose. The primary objective was demonstration of noninferiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers induced by the dose in this study versus the first dose of NVX-CoV-2373 in the earlier study.

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733782219146
