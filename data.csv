Here, we identify a group of LTR retrotransposons that infect the germline from somatic cells within the Drosophila ovary, despite lacking the fusogenic Envelope protein typically required for retroviral entry. Instead, these elements encode a short transmembrane protein, sORF2, with structural features reminiscent of viral cell-cell fusogens. Through genetics, imaging, and electron microscopy, we show that sORF2 localizes to invasive somatic protrusions, enabling the direct transfer of retrotransposon capsids into the oocyte. Remarkably, sORF2-like proteins are widespread among insect retrotransposons and also occur in piscine nackednaviruses and avian picornaviruses. These findings reveal a noncanonical, Envelope-independent transmission mechanism shared by retrotransposons and non-enveloped viruses, offering important insights into host-pathogen evolution and soma-germline interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

In this study, we demonstrate that precise, sensitive, and specific antibody design can be achieved without prior antibody information across six distinct target proteins. For each target, binders were identified from a yeast display scFv library of approximately 106 sequences, constructed by combining 102 designed light chain sequences with 104 designed heavy chain sequences. Binders with varying binding strengths were identified for all six targets, including a case where no experimentally resolved target protein structure was available, demonstrating the highest level of precision compared to previous de novo antibody design reports. For one of the targets, antibodies produced in the IgG format exhibited affinity, activity, and developability, comparable to a commercial antibody, highlighting the sensitivity of the design method. Furthermore, binders capable of distinguishing closely related protein subtypes or mutants were identified, demonstrating that the method can achieve high molecular specificity. These findings underscore the effectiveness of precision molecular design based on atomic-accuracy structure prediction. This study establishes computational antibody design as a viable approach for generating therapeutic molecules with tailored properties, with promising potential for achieving the efficacy and safety required for successful therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

Bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and biochemical approaches were integrated to characterize PRRs from 285 plant species. We identified a receptor, named ""SCORE"", that perceives cold-shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit remarkable CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues.

Many recent studies have quantified their adverse events with a focus on gastrointestinal adverse events. However, no large epidemiologic study has investigated the risk of hair loss with these medications. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk. Using a random sample of 16 million patients, we identified new users of semaglutide and an active comparator bupropion-naltrexone. We excluded those with a diagnosis of diabetes or use of antihyperglycemics prior to cohort entry. Cohort members were followed from the first date of a study drug prescription to the diagnosis of hair loss. We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively.

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1742335770988

Here, we introduce Steady-state On-the-Ramp Detection of INduction-decay with Oversampling (SORDINO), a transformative fMRI technique that addresses these challenges by maintaining a constant total gradient amplitude while acquiring data during continuously changing gradient direction. When benchmarked against conventional fMRI on a 9.4T system, SORDINO is silent, sensitive, specific, and resistant to motion and susceptibility artifacts. SORDINO offers superior compatibility with multimodal experiments and carries novel contrast mechanisms distinct from BOLD. It also enables brain-wide activity and connectivity mapping in awake, behaving mice, overcoming stress- and motion-related confounds that are among the most challenging barriers in current animal fMRI studies.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects patients quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and C reactive protein were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1742335770988

Here we aimed to determine the distribution of microplastics after oral exposure in mice and their interactions with and effects on mouse and human innate immune cells. We established that both 1 and 10m polystyrene (PS) particles penetrated the intestinal epithelium after oral administration and could be detected in blood and liver of mice after ten days of oral administration. Using intravital microscopy we captured the in vivo phagocytosis of 1m PS by mouse neutrophils in the liver. Pristine PS were barely phagocytosed by primary human phagocytes, however, 1 and 10{micro}m PS pre-incubated with plasma were readily phagocytosed by human neutrophils and monocytes. Plasma-coated 1 and 10m PS both increased human neutrophil and monocyte cell death but only after phagocytosis. Importantly, neutrophil cell death occurred a few hours after phagocytosing a single coated 10{micro}m PS while PS of 1{micro}m needed to be administered at a ratio of 27 particles per cell to induce significant neutrophil cell death. Neutrophil cell death upon microplastic exposure was characterized by extracellular DNA, which together with other released DAMPs can potentially trigger inflammation.

To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

While the transport of phospholipids synthesized at the inner membrane (IM) to the outer membrane (OM) is critical for maintaining OM integrity and functionality, the molecular mechanisms governing this process remain incompletely understood. Members of the AsmA-like protein family in E. coli have been implicated in lipid transfer to the OM, with the three largest proteins--TamB, YhdP, and YdbH--proposed as redundant lipid transporters. Of these, TamB associates with the outer membrane protein TamA to form the Translocation and Assembly Module (TAM), a complex also implicated in outer membrane protein assembly. Here, we use a combination of structural modelling, coarse grained and all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the lipid transfer ability of TAM and other members of the AsmA-like family. We show that lipids spontaneously enter from the IM and diffuse upwards through the large periplasmic spanning groove of TamB. Lipid dissociation at the OM is impeded when TamA is in complex with TamB but occurs spontaneously in structures of TamB alone. Finally, we also demonstrate that all six members of the AsmA family in E. coli can accommodate lipids within their hydrophobic grooves.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

Plants have evolved a complex set of cell-cycle genes with unique features. The high number of cyclin-CDK pairs in flowering plants complicates functional studies due to redundancy and diversification. It is critical to study simple systems in other plant lineages to better understand the functional integration of the cell-cycle control machinery and its evolution across land plants.

Through a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, we show that non-seed plants possess a simple repertoire of cyclin and CDK proteins, suggesting that the observed complexity in seed plants is a derived trait. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha possess a streamlined set of core cell cycle genes with minimal redundancy during vegetative development. Using single-cell RNA-seq and fluorescent reporters, we found a precise, phase-specific pattern of expression for cell cycle genes. We demonstrated in vivo that only three cyclins are active, one at a given phase, without redundancy. Functional analyses revealed that MpCYCD;1 promotes cell cycle re-entry and disrupts differentiation, while overexpression of MpCYCA or MpCYCB;1 arrests the cell cycle, consistent with their respective roles at G1, S, and G2/M progression.

Our findings highlight the functional conservation of mechanisms for cell-cycle control across eukaryotes and provide insights into its ancestral state, revealing a minimal set of functional components required for multicellular development.

Varicose projection (VP) astrocytes, traditionally considered specific to humans and apes, were suggested to reflect pathological burden, albeit direct evidence linking them to neurological diseases has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that VP astrocytes are present in mice and tigers (Panthera tigris) and we provide evidence from four distinct human-based models that VP astrocytes are not a distinct physiological astrocyte subtype but rather a novel class of reactive astrocytes associated with neuropathology. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes, mixed neural cultures, and cortical organoids, we showed that VP astrocytes are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) or LPS. Notably, cytokine withdrawal reverses the VP phenotype of astrocytes, indicating that it is a transient, inflammation-dependent state. We characterized the distinctive components of varicosities, including markers for extracellular vesicles, mitochondria, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum components, suggesting roles in cellular stress responses and metabolic dysregulation. We further validated the pathological relevance of VP astrocytes by documenting their significant enrichment in postmortem brain samples from patients with several neurodegenerative diseases including as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in surgical resections from patients with epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis or brain tumors, including previously unreported subcortical regions such as basal ganglia. Additionally, we identified a higher number of VP astrocytes also in mouse astrocytes upon treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the formation of VP astrocytes is an evolutionarily conserved astrocytic response to neuroinflammation. Our findings point to VP astrocytes as a novel reactive astrocyte subtype closely linked to neuropathology, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurological diseases. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the mechanisms driving VP astrocyte formation and their broader implications in neuropathology.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing.

Genetic factors that determine sensitivity to WEE1 inhibitors (WEE1i) are largely unknown. A genome-wide insertional mutagenesis screen revealed that mutation of EIF2A, a translation regulator, sensitized to WEE1i. Mechanistically, WEE1i treatment triggers a translational shut-down, which is lethal in combination with the reduced translation of EIF2AKO cells. A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen revealed that inactivation of integrated stress response (ISR) kinases GCN1/2 rescued WEE1i-mediated cytotoxicity. WEE1i induced GCN2 activation, ATF4 upregulation, and altered ribosome dynamics. Loss of the collided ribosome sensor ZNF598 conversely increased sensitivity to WEE1i. Notably, the ISR was not required for WEE1i to induce DNA damage, premature mitotic entry or sensitization to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics. ISR activation was independent of CDK1/2 activation. Importantly, WEE1i-mediated ISR activation was independent of WEE1 presence, pointing at off-target effects, which are shared by multiple chemically distinct WEE1i. This response was also observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Importantly, low-dose WEE1 inhibition did not induce ISR activation, while it still synergized with PKMYT1 inhibition.

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

However, progress in improving clinical outcomes has been limited by an incomplete understanding of CAR T-cell differentiation in patients. To comprehensively investigate CAR T-cell differentiation in vivo, we performed single-cell, multi-modal, and longitudinal analyses of CD28-costimulated CAR T cells from infusion product and peripheral blood (day 8-28) of patients with DLBCL who were successfully treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel. Here, we show that CD8+ CAR T cells undergo two distinct waves of clonal expansion. The first wave is dominated by CAR T cells with an exhausted-like effector memory phenotype during the peak expansion period (day 8-14). The second wave is dominated by CAR T cells with a terminal effector phenotype during the post-peak persistence period (day 21-28). Importantly, the two waves have distinct ontogeny and are biologically uncoupled. Furthermore, lineage tracing analysis via each CAR T cells endogenous TCR clonotype demonstrates that the two waves originate from different effector precursors in the infusion product. Precursors of the first wave exhibit more effector-like signatures, whereas precursors of the second wave exhibit more stem-like signatures. These findings suggest that pre-infusion heterogeneity mediates the two waves of in vivo clonal expansion. Our findings provide evidence against the intuitive idea that the post-peak contraction in CAR abundance is solely apoptosis or extravasation of short-lived CAR T cells from peak expansion. Rather, our findings demonstrate that CAR T-cell expansion and persistence are mediated by clonally, phenotypically, and ontogenically distinct CAR T-cell populations that serve complementary clinical purposes.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

Oxygen has been shown to be produced and consumed in dark and anoxic environments, as evidenced by its prevalence in deep-sea surface sediments. However, the microbial communities and pathways driving deep-sea dark oxygen production (DOP) remain poorly understood. Here we identify a novel DOP pathway driven by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in two deep-sea Deferribacterota strains. The DOP activity of these Deferribacterota strains potentially promotes the formation of manganese nodules and influences the growth and metabolism of both aerobic and anaerobic microbes, underscoring the significant role of microbial DOP in shaping deep-sea geological and ecological systems. We also cultured several deep-sea DOP-capable microorganisms from the Campylobacterota, Deinococcota, and Pseudomonadota phyla, which generate dark oxygen through unidentified nitrate-driven pathways. Combined with previous geological evidence, our results suggest that nitrate-driven dark oxygen, alongside photosynthetic oxygen, jointly contributed to early Earths oxygenation, driving the Great Oxidation Event. Overall, our findings provide novel insights into deep-sea oxygen sources, shed light on the origins of early Earths oxygen, and expand perspectives on the potential for terraforming other planets.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

However, the ability of these ring-shaped DNA motors to navigate large DNA-bound obstacles, such as DNA/RNA polymerases and ribosomes in prokaryotes, has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a bacterial SMC Wadjet complex can efficiently bypass obstacles larger than the SMC coiled coil lumen if they are linked to the extruded DNA by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This process is mediated by the selective entrapment of the ssDNA linker within the SMC hinge channel, which acts as an obligate gate, permitting ssDNA passage while excluding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). By threading the linker through the hinge gate as dsDNA is translocated through the SMC motor, the obstacle can follow a trajectory distinct from its associated dsDNA, remaining outside the SMC ring. This mechanism enables continuous dsDNA entrapment while successfully bypassing obstacles. We show that hinges of diverse SMC complexes including eukaryotic condensin and Smc5/6 also selectively accommodate ssDNA, suggesting that hinge bypass is a conserved feature across SMC proteins. We demonstrate that while the hinge domain is essential for obstacle bypass, it is dispensable for loop extrusion, showing that these functions are independent, provided by separate SMC modules. These findings uncover the long-sought function of the SMC hinge toroid and provide the first mechanistic explanation for how DNA-entrapping SMC complexes can extrude loops on chromosomal DNA densely populated with obstacles. Integrating hinge bypass into the DNA loop extrusion model, we propose that the hinge may also facilitate the passage of RNA and peptide, enabling bypass of transcription-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes and other SMC complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

However, platform heterogeneity, batch effects, and the lack of unified methods for single- and multi-omics analyses represent relevant drawbacks that hinder the extrapolation of a meaningful biological interpretation. Statistical meta-analysis is widely used in order to integrate several omics datasets of the same type, leading to the extrapolation of robust molecular signatures within the investigated system. Conversely, statistical meta-analysis does not allow the simultaneous investigation of different molecular layers, and, therefore, the integration of multi-modal data deriving from multi-omics experiments. Although in the last few years a number of valid tools designed for multi-omics data integration have emerged, they have never been combined with statistical meta-analysis tools in a unique analytical solution in order to support meaningful biological interpretation. Network science is at the forefront of systems biology, where the inference of molecular interactomes allowed the investigation of perturbed biological systems, by shedding light on the disrupted relationships that keep the homeostasis of complex systems. Here, we present MUUMI, an R package that unifies network-based data integration and statistical meta-analysis within a single analytical framework. MUUMI allows the identification of robust molecular signatures through multiple meta-analytic methods, inference and analysis of molecular interactomes and the integration of multiple omics layers through similarity network fusion. We demonstrate the functionalities of MUUMI by presenting two case studies in which we analysed 1) 17 transcriptomic datasets on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) from both microarray and RNA-Seq platforms and 2) multi-omics data of THP-1 macrophages exposed to different polarising stimuli. In both examples, MUUMI revealed biologically coherent signatures, underscoring its value in elucidating complex biological processes.

In this study, we developed an aptamer (Apt343) that targets IF3N with the goal of elucidating its contribution to translation initiation. Rapid kinetics assays revealed that Apt343 reduces the rate of IF3 association with the 30S ribosomal subunit by 13-fold, while inducing a pronounced rearrangement of both IF3 domains on the 30S. These changes compromise IF2-, mRNA-, and fMet-tRNAfMet-dependent movements of IF3, delaying 30S initiation complex (30S IC) formation by up to two orders of magnitude. Cryo-EM analysis suggests that Apt343 may sterically clash with fMet-tRNAfMet, thereby perturbing the canonical pathway by which the initiator tRNA is accommodated after IF2-dependent recruitment and prior to start codon decoding. However, once the 30S IC is formed, blocking IF3N does not prevent 50S subunit joining or 70S IC assembly. Collectively, these findings support a role for IF3N in enhancing an efficient path for fMet-tRNAfMet accommodation towards the 30S IC and promoting IF3C displacement to unlock 50S recruitment.

The universally conserved F1Fo-ATP synthase regenerates ATP from ADP and Pi by harnessing a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient (pmf). Bacteria have evolved a wide diversity of pmf-forming proteins to make ATP using light, organic, and inorganic energy sources. Recently, we proposed that many bacteria survive using atmospheric trace gases to produce ATP when limited for other energy sources. However, there is no direct proof that atmospheric energy sources are sufficient to generate pmf or drive ATP synthesis. Here, we show that the membrane-associated hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase Huc from Mycobacterium smegmatis enables ATP synthesis from air. Purified Huc couples H2 oxidation to the reduction of various ubiquinone and menaquinone analogues. We designed and optimised a minimal respiratory chain in which Huc is reconstituted into liposomes with a pmf-generating terminal oxidase and the ATP-generating F1Fo-ATP synthase. Our experiments show that passive hydrogen exchange from air to solution is sufficient for the electron transfer and pmf generation required to accumulate ATP. Finally, by combining continuous culture bioenergetics measurements with theoretical calculations, we show this process is sufficient for mycobacteria to sustain pmf and ATP synthesis (two ATP molecules per H2 oxidised) for maintenance energy requirements during nutrient starvation. These findings prove that atmospheric energy sources are dependable ""lifeline"" substrates that enable continuous energy conservation during nutrient starvation. In addition, this work provides a new tool for ATP production in synthetic applications, which unlike other approaches is traceless without by-product accumulation.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within pre-infection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, post-infection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection.

However, while PLMs excel at capturing individual protein properties, they face challenges in natively representing protein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are crucial to understanding cellular processes and disease mechanisms. Here, we introduce MINT, a PLM specifically designed to model sets of interacting proteins in a contextual and scalable manner. Using unsupervised training on a large curated PPI dataset derived from the STRING database, MINT outperforms existing PLMs in diverse tasks relating to protein-protein interactions, including binding affinity prediction and estimation of mutational effects. Beyond these core capabilities, it excels at modeling interactions in complex protein assemblies and surpasses specialized models in antibody-antigen modeling and T cell receptor-epitope binding prediction. MINT's predictions of mutational impacts on oncogenic PPIs align with experimental studies, and it provides reliable estimates for the potential for cross-neutralization of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These findings position MINT as a powerful tool for elucidating complex protein interactions, with significant implications for biomedical research and therapeutic discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770988

Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer- and region-specificity. In Parkinson's disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155.

However, preparing inputs for the locally installed software is not always straightforward, and the results of local runs are not always presented in an ideally accessible fashion. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the latest tools perform equivalently for all types of target. Results: ABCFold facilitates the use of AlphaFold 3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 with a standardised input to predict atomic structures, with Boltz-1 and Chai-1 being installed on runtime (if required). MSAs can be generated internally using either the JackHMMER MSA search within AlphaFold 3, or with the MMseqs2 API. Alternatively, users can provide their own custom MSAs. This therefore allows AlphaFold 3 to be installed and run without downloading the large databases needed for JackHMMER. There are also straightforward options to use templates, including custom templates. Results from all packages are treated in a unified fashion, enabling easy comparison of results from different methods. A variety of visualisation options are available which include information on steric clashes. Availability and implementation: ABCFold is coded in Python and JavaScript.

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1742335770989

Furthermore, our molecular composition analysis indicates that cell walls of P. taiti include aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic components most similar to fossilisation products of lignin, but no fossilisation products characteristic of chitin or chitosan, which are diagnostic of all groups of extant and extinct fungi, including those preserved in the Rhynie chert.

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included. We used a common data model, using individual level data linked from nation-wide registers and a shared analysis script to harmonize data and analysis. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) comparing outcome rates in risk windows to unvaccinated or uninfected follow-up rates. This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D. Neither did we observe any clear association with recurrent hospital visits following BNT162b2 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. An association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS was observed in both the 28-day and 180-day risk window (relative risk (RR) 15.10, 95% CI, 1.11-205.94, and RR 3.85, 1.33-11.14, respectively).

ConclusionsBNT162b2 vaccination was not associated with new-onset or recurrent hospital visits of these diseases in children and adolescents. Sars-CoV-2 infection was associated with new-onset GBS. Estimates were however uncertain due to the small number of cases.","NA","medrxiv",1742335770989

Whether the level, structure, and content of ripple-nested activity are consistent across consecutive events or are tuned in each event remains unclear. By profiling individual ripples using laminar currents in the mouse hippocampus during sleep/rest, we identified Radsink and LMsink ripples featuring current sinks in stratum radiatum versus stratum lacunosum-moleculare, respectively. These two ripple profiles recruit neurons differently. Radsink ripples integrate recent motifs of waking coactivity, combining superficial and deep CA1 principal cells into denser, higher-dimensional patterns that undergo hour-long stable reactivation. In contrast, LMsink ripples contain core motifs of prior coactivity, engaging deep cells into sparser, lower-dimensional patterns that undergo a reactivation drift, gradually updating their pre-structured content for recent wakefulness. We propose that ripple-by-ripple diversity instantiates parallel reactivation channels for stable integration of recent wakefulness and flexible updating of prior internal representations.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

However, traditional fish models, such as zebrafish, regenerate only dermal fin rays, which are neither homologous to limbs nor as cellularly complex. To address this, we employed a multi-omics approach leveraging the regenerative capacity of Polypterus senegalus, a fish species capable of full fin regeneration. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed extensive erythrocyte and myeloid cell infiltration during Polypterus fin regeneration. Spatial transcriptomics identified key cellular contributors to the blastema, while cross-species comparisons with axolotl limbs uncovered both common and divergent expression patterns of wound epidermis and blastema markers. Fin amputation triggered a conserved injury response, including sequential activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory programs and DNA damage repair in cycling cells. Hypoxia responses involved hif1a modulation, consistent with other regenerative models, but uniquely included the expression of hif4a in erythrocytes and the upregulation of a myoglobin gene in the wound epidermis. Furthermore, genome-wide chromatin profiling identified candidate regeneration-responsive elements. Together, these findings establish Polypterus as a powerful comparative model for identifying shared and derived mechanisms of limb and fin regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

In mice, as in other mammals, color vision originates in the retina, where photoreceptor signals are processed by neural circuits. However, retinal responses to stimuli involving multiple colors are still not well understood. One possible explanation of this knowledge gap is that previous studies have not thoroughly examined how neuronal activity adapts to a 30 seconds to a few minutes timescale when exposed to multiple color sources. To address this, we systematically varied the UV-to-green light balance with a custom-built stimulator targeting mice opsins spectra while recording retinal ganglion cell responses in the ventral retina using multielectrode arrays. Responses to full-field chirp and checkerboard stimulations with alternating UV and green light revealed that more than one order of magnitude of intensity difference favoring green M- opsin over UV S-opsin is needed for a balanced reliability in retinal ganglion cell responses. An incorrect balance, with slightly increased UV light, silenced responses to green illumination. To determine if these values are consistent with natural conditions, we analyzed isomerisation rates in the mouse retina across different times of the day. We found that the M- to S-opsin activation ratio remains constant through the mesopic-photopic range, and our empirically determined values align well with these natural conditions, lying far from a simple equalization of M- and S-opsin isomerisation rates. In conclusion, a finely tuned color intensity balance is essential for accurately measuring both fast temporal responses and detailed spatial receptive fields.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

This New Zealand snail is unusual in featuring multiple separate transitions from obligately sexual to obligately asexual reproduction, leading to the coexistence of phenotypically similar sexual and asexual forms, a feature that is required to directly study the maintenance of sex.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), precursors to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote cancer progression by suppressing anti-tumour immune responses. Hypersialylation of glycans on tumours engages Siglec receptors on immune cells, driving immune dysfunction, but its role in stromal-mediated immunosuppression remains unclear. Sialic acids and Siglec ligands were measured on CRC tissue, primary human CAFs, and tumour-conditioned-mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCTCS) and CAF using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells was assessed in ex vivo primary stromal and immune cell co-cultures and expression of Siglec-10 and immune cell phenotype markers and function were measured by flow cytometry. Using an immunocompetent Balb/c CT26 mouse model, we induced tumours with/without conditioned stromal cells, with/without pre-treatment of stromal cells with sialyltransferase inhibitor (3FAX) or sialidase (E610). We assessed the effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells in the tumour and secondary lymphoid tissues by flow cytometry. Stromal cells, including CAFs, in CRC tumours are highly sialylated compared to epithelial cancer cells and are associated with high expression of ST6GalNAC6. Genetic knockdown of ST6GalNAC6 reduced the expression of stromal cell Siglec-10 ligands in MSCs. CAFs and MSCTCS induced Siglec-10 on macrophages and NK cells and impaired NK cell cytotoxicity. Sialidase treatment reduced Siglec-10 expression, restoring NK cell function. In vivo, desialylation of stromal cells increased macrophage activation (CD11b+CD80+) and reduced immunosuppressive marker expression (CD206, PD-L1, Siglec-G) in lymphoid tissues, indicating sustained systemic anti-tumour immunity. Intratumoural NK cells exhibited high Siglec-G expression and impaired cytotoxicity, and granzyme B expression significantly increased with sialidase treatment of stromal cells. In an inflammatory tumour model, inflammatory tumour-conditioned (iTCS) MSCs promoted metastasis and Siglec-G induction on NK cells and macrophages, both reversed by sialyltransferase inhibition, underscoring the effects of stromal modulation of innate immune cell function in inflammatory tumours. Stromal cell sialylation modulates innate immune suppression in CRC via the sialic acid/Siglec axis. Targeting stromal sialylation restores NK cytotoxicity and macrophage activation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for immunosuppressive stromal-rich tumours.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

While peptides presented to CD4+ T cells via major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) are traditionally thought to be derived from extracellular sources that are processed by antigen presenting cells (APCs) through the classical exogenous pathway4,5, the precise mechanisms of mRNA-LNP vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell priming remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of alternative, endogenous antigen presentation pathways6,7 in inducing CD4+ T cell responses to mRNA-LNP vaccines. APCs treated with mRNA-LNP vaccines were consistently superior in activating T cells under conditions of endogenous, rather than exogenous, presentation. Immunization with an mRNA-LNP vaccine that excludes antigen expression in APCs resulted in lower antigen-specific CD4+ T cell, T follicular helper cell, and antibody responses than mice receiving control vaccine. In contrast, depletion of vaccine antigen from exogenous sources such as muscle cells resulted in little to no reduction in antigen-specific CD4+ T cells.

Our prior works show that shortening the S1/S2 loop by deleting either the FCS ({Delta}PRRA) or deleting an upstream sequence ({Delta}QTQTN), ablates spike processing, alters host protease usage, and attenuates infection in vitro and in vivo. With the importance of the loop length established, here we evaluated the impact of disrupting the FCS, but preserving the S1/S2 loop length. Using reverse genetics, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that disrupts the FCS (PQQAR) but maintains its extended S1/S2 loop. The SARS-CoV-2 PQQAR mutant has reduced replication, decreased spike processing, and attenuated disease in vivo compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. These data, similar to the FCS deletion mutant, indicate that loss of the furin cleavage site attenuates SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Importantly, we subsequently found that the PQQAR mutant is transmitted in the direct contact hamster model despite lacking an intact FCS. However, competition transmission showed that the mutant was attenuated compared to WT SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data argue that the FCS is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis but is not strictly required for viral transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Performance was worse for unexpected long delays than for unexpected short delays, suggesting that WM may be tuned to expire in a delay-dependent manner.

Pa has three complete QS circuits controlled by the regulators LasR, RhlR, and PqsR, that together activate hundreds of genes. In the well-studied strain PAO1, QS is organized hierarchically, with PqsR and RhlR activity dependent on LasR. This hierarchy depends on the non-QS transcription factor MexT; deletion of mexT allows for RhlR activity in the absence of LasR. We aimed to identify how MexT modulates the Pa QS architecture. We compared the transcriptome of PAO1 to that of PAO1{Delta}mexT and determined a MexT regulon. We identified two MexT-regulated operons that may affect the QS hierarchy: the efflux pump genes mexEF-oprN and the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) synthesis genes pqsABCDE. We tested whether the products of these genes affected the QS hierarchy. A mexEF knockout mutant, like a mexT deletion mutant, exhibited RhlR activity earlier, and to a higher magnitude, than wild-type PAO1. MexEF-OprN is known to export quinolones, and we found that exogenous addition of PQS, through PqsE, also resulted in earlier and higher magnitude of RhlR activity compared to wild-type PAO1. We also discovered alternate QS architectures in clinical isolates, where RhlR activity is not fully dependent on LasR. In these isolates, surprisingly, MexT does not influence the relationship between LasR and RhlR. Our work reveals a new suite of factors that regulate QS in Pa, with implications for bacterial behaviors in environmental and clinical settings.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Yeast Dsk2 scaffolds proteasome-containing condensates via multivalent interactions with proteasomes and ubiquitinated substrates under azide-induced mitochondrial stress or extended growth conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how these shuttle proteins work are unknown. Here, we identify that the middle chaperone-binding STI1 domain is the main driver of Dsk2 self-association and phase separation in vitro. On a molecular level, we find that the STI1 domain interacts with three transient amphipathic helices within the intrinsically-disordered regions of Dsk2. Removal of either the STI1 domain or these helices significantly reduces the propensity for Dsk2 to phase separate. In vivo, removal of the STI1 domain in Dsk2 has the opposite effect, resulting in an increase of proteasome-containing condensates due to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated substrates. Modeling of STI1-helix interactions reveals a binding mode that is reminiscent of interactions between chaperone STI1/DP2 domains and client proteins containing amphipathic or transmembrane helices. Our findings support a model whereby STI1-helix interactions important for Dsk2 condensate formation can be replaced by STI1-client interactions for downstream chaperone or other protein quality control outcomes.

These environments harbor diverse microbial communities, including both beneficial and pathogenic species, which can influence public health. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the need to monitor microbial ecosystems, particularly with respect to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes that may have escalated due to increased antibiotic use during health crises. In a first-of-its-kind study in India, we comprehensively characterized microbial communities and the prevalence of AMR genes in the Chennai Metro system. Of the 96 surface swab samples collected from 12 stations across two metro lines, 47 samples passed quality control and were subsequently analyzed using whole genome metagenomic sequencing. Comparative analysis with global urban microbiome datasets revealed distinct microbial profiles, including eight core species unique to Chennai. Surface type significantly influenced microbial diversity, with kiosks displaying the highest diversity levels. While AMR gene presence was minimal overall, genes associated with Sulfonamide and Rifamycin resistance were detected. These findings highlight unique microbial signatures and emphasize the need for ongoing surveillance and targeted interventions to mitigate microbial transmission risks in densely populated urban areas.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

We show that mdx MuSCs have impaired migration and precocious differentiation through unbalanced symmetric divisions, driven by p38 and PI3K signalling pathways, in contrast to the p38-only dependence of healthy MuSCs. Cross-grafting shows that MuSC fate decisions are governed by intrinsic cues, whereas their migration behaviour is determined by the extracellular niche.

Current chemical-based treatments target cells by inhibiting growth or metabolic function, but their effectiveness is diminishing. To address the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies. Conjugative plasmids, a natural mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, have been repurposed to deliver toxic genetic cargo to recipient cells, showing promise as next-generation antimicrobial agents. However, the ecological risks posed by unintended gene transfer require robust biocontainment strategies. In this study, we developed inducible conjugative plasmids to solve these challenges. Utilizing an arabinose-inducible promoter, we evaluated 13 plasmids with single essential gene deletions, identifying trbC and trbF as strong candidates for stringent regulation. These plasmids demonstrated inducibility in both cis and trans configurations, with induction resulting in up to a 5-log increase in conjugation efficiency compared to uninduced conditions. Although challenges such as reduced conjugation efficiency and promoter leakiness persist, this work establishes a foundation for the controlled transfer of plasmids, paving the way for safer and more effective antimicrobial technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

However, the high host DNA to bacterial DNA ratio is a challenge. Nanopore adaptive sampling (AS) can be used to preferentially sequence more of the infecting organism. Here, we evaluate AS using clinical samples from infected prosthetic joints to determine the absolute fold enrichment achieved. We found that AS achieved a range of 1.61 to 1.96-fold higher absolute fold enrichment for bacterial sequenced bases using AS over control pores. In this limited sample set, AS did not impact bacterial diagnosis overall but led to a modest increase in the bacterial sequence available without any obvious cost.

3. Impact statementMetagenomic approaches offer the possibility to rapidly detect the cause of an infection and to provide information on drug susceptibility. Implementing this technique is challenging because samples collected from patients contain high levels of human DNA which can obscure detection of bacterial DNA. Reducing the amount of human DNA sequenced would allow easier detection of bacteria. This study assessed a sequencing protocol that rejects human DNA during the sequencing process known as adaptive sampling (AS), specifically as concerns samples from patients with joint infections. Our findings demonstrate that AS can increase bacterial sequencing efficiency. However, these modest improvements did not significantly enhance bacterial identification in our small sample set, although we did not detect additional costs associated with using AS.

The study confirms modest utility of AS in real-world clinical samples and extends current literature by applying AS to joint infection. The implications of this method extend to clinical microbiology, where rapid and accurate pathogen detection can significantly impact patient outcomes.

However, the precise mechanism of Ca2+ oscillations and whether their control loop resides at the plasma membrane or intracellularly remain unresolved. By examining the dynamics of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Ca2+ sensor that activates the Orai1 channel on the plasma membrane for SOCE and in mast cells, we found that a significant proportion of cells exhibited STIM1 oscillations with the same periodicity as Ca2+ oscillations. These cortical oscillations, occurring in the cell's cortical region and shared with ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact site proteins, were only detectable using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). Notably, STIM1 oscillations could occur independently of Ca2+ oscillations. Simultaneous imaging of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and ER Ca2+ with SEPIA-ER revealed that receptor activation does not deplete ER Ca2+, whereas receptor activation without extracellular Ca2+ influx induces cyclic ER Ca2+ depletion. However, under such nonphysiological conditions, cyclic ER Ca2+ oscillations lead to sustained STIM1 recruitment, indicating that oscillatory Ca2+ release is neither necessary nor sufficient for STIM1 oscillations. Using optogenetic tools to manipulate ER-PM contact site dynamics, we found that persistent ER-PM contact sites reduced the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations without alteration of oscillation frequency. Together, these findings suggest an active cortical mechanism governs the rapid dissociation of ER-PM contact sites, thereby controlling the amplitude of oscillatory Ca2+ dynamics during receptor-induced Ca2+ oscillations.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

To address this challenge, we developed a renewable electrochemical impedance biosensor device employing a synthetic nucleotide-based therapeutic aptamer (termed aptasensor) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We demonstrate that our aptasensor can detect the Omicron BA.2 S protein within one hour and possesses concentration-dependent sensitivity at biologically relevant levels.

Aptamer binding to the S protein was confirmed by immunogold labeling and visualization by negative-stain electron microscopy. We used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to resolve high-resolution maps of the S protein in both the open and closed conformations and characterized aptamer binding to the up RBD in the open conformation.

However, the precise RNA editing targets altered by stimulation and the consequences of RNA editing on gene expression and the proteome have been understudied. We present a comprehensive RNA editing analysis of stimulated myeloid cells across three independent cohorts totalling 297 samples, including monocytes and IPS-derived microglia. We observed that C-to-U editing, while less abundant, has a higher effect size in response to stimulation than A-to-I, and has a greater potential to recode the proteome. We investigated the consequences of RNA editing on RNA stability and gene expression using in silico and in vitro reporter methods, and identified a recoding C-to-U site in ARSB that mimics a reported lysosomal storage disorder mutation.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

These include photoreceptor cells and airway epithelia, where they function in light sensation and mucociliary clearance respectively. Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) variants affect both photoreceptor sensory cilia and airway motile cilia, leading to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and in some cases, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), both debilitating conditions. Not all patients develop PCD and it is unclear which RPGR variants predispose patients to PCD and why this happens. In this study, using nasal biopsy samples of patients with RPGR-related RP, we leverage 2D organoid cell culturing, super-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging to characterize the multiciliated cells from patients with different RPGR variants, healthy human nasal and bronchial multiciliated cells with CRISPR-modified RPGR function. We demonstrate for the first time that multiciliated cells with RPGR variants may have reduced ciliation, shorter cilia, significantly impaired cilia beat, or cilia beat incoordination, which could lead to defective mucociliary clearance and lung disease. In addition, we show the regulation of motile cilia by RPGR involves F-actin, as evidenced by temporarily reduced Gelsolin and undissolved condensed actin meshwork at the apical surface of RPGR-deficient multiciliated cells. In support, we show that the motile cilia defect can be ameliorated by treating with the actin polymerization inhibitor Latrunculin A. Though PCD was observed only in patients with variants that affect both main isoforms (RPGR1-19 and RPGRORF15), patients with variants affecting only RPGRORF15 also showed cilia and airway anomalies. Though all RPGR variants affected motile cilia in one way or another, RPGR loss of function variants affecting both isoforms are associated with more severe cilia and systemic phenotypes, the mechanisms of which involve the accumulation of apical F-actin.

One Sentence Summary: Loss of RPGR, through the mechanism of apical F-actin accumulation in airway multiciliated cells, leads to reduced ciliation with short cilia that have an impaired beat, leading to defective mucociliary clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Yet, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Calcium (Ca2+) signals, which initiate embryo development at fertilization, are frequently disrupted in human ART. In mice, abnormal Ca2+ signals at fertilization impair embryo development and adult offspring metabolism. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ drive mitochondrial activity and production of metabolites used by the epigenetic machinery. For example, acetyl-CoA (derived mainly from pyruvate) and lactyl-CoA (derived from lactate) are used for writing H3K27ac and H3K18la marks that orchestrate initiation of development. Using both a genetic mouse model and treatment with ionomycin to raise intracellular Ca2+ of wild-type fertilized eggs, we found that excess Ca2+ at fertilization changes metabolic substrate availability, causing epigenetic changes that impact embryo development and offspring health. Specifically, increased Ca2+ exposure at fertilization led to increased H3K27ac levels and decreased H3K18la levels at the 1-cell (1C) stage, that persisted until the 2-cell (2C) stage. Ultralow input CUT&Tag revealed significant differences in H3K27ac and H3K18la genomic profiles between control and ionomycin groups. In addition, increased Ca2+ exposure resulted in a marked reduction in global transcription at the 1C stage that persisted through the 2C stage due to diminished activity of RNA polymerase I. Excess Ca2+ following fertilization increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity (enzyme that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA) and decreased total lactate levels. Provision of exogenous lactyl-CoA before ionomycin treatment restored H3K18la levels at the 1C and 2C stages and rescued global transcription to control levels. Our findings demonstrate conclusively that Ca2+ dynamics drive metabolic regulation of epigenetic reprogramming at fertilization and alter EGA.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

To address this challenge, we report the discovery and characterization of a small-molecule activator of USP7 called MS-8. We showed that MS-8 activates USP7 by engaging the allosteric C-terminal binding pocket of USP7, thus mimicking the allosteric autoactivation by the USP7 C-terminal tail. We observed that MS-8 engages and activates mutant USP7 in a cellular context, impacting downstream proteins. Taken together, our study provides validation of the USP7 activator that paves the way towards novel activation-driven USP7 pharmacology.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

These substrates impose unique metabolic constraints: succinate requires complete gluconeogenesis, while glycerol supports mixed glycolytic and gluconeogenic fluxes. Multi-scale computational analysis of the strains revealed (a) Growth optimization across carbon substrates for multiple ETS variants, (b) A conserved aerobicity stimulon comprising seven independently regulated gene groups that are co-regulated with increasing aerobic capacities, (c) Proteome reallocation linked to aerobicity, validated using genome-scale metabolism and expression modeling, and (d) Carbon source-specific compensatory mutations in succinate transporters and regulatory elements.

However, quantifiable measures to make informed decision on the taxonomic placement of bacterial taxa above the level of species are rare, which hampers the stability of knowledge in databases and articles. In this work, we focused on bacterial classification at the genus level and revisited the concept of Percentage Of Conserved Proteins (POCP). Whilst POCP is broadly used as an overall genome relatedness index, the underlying tool and method of calculation differ, resulting in disparate implementations and misnomers unfit for the increasing wealth of public genomes available. Results: We evaluated 10 protein alignments methods and found evidence for a scalable yet robust alternative to BLASTP for POCP based on 2,358,466 pairwise comparisons of 4,767 genomes across 35 families. However, we showed that certain combinations of tools and parameters are not suited for POCP calculations owing to drastic over- or underestimation. Therefore, we bring forward a clearer definition of POCP using only unique matches, termed POCPu, that showed better genus delineation than with POCP. We suggested tentative family-specific thresholds when the standard of 50% was not resolutive enough. Conclusions: We propose that faster bacterial genus delineation should be calculated with DIAMOND using very-sensitive settings and only unique matches (POCPu). We advise microbiologists to carefully assess that the tools used for genus assignment match their biological assumptions to avoid misguided inferences.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Ideally, as a clinically valid biomarker, brain age should indicate the current state of health and also be predictive of future disease onset and detrimental changes in brain biology. In this preregistered study, we evaluated and compared the clinical validity, i.e., diagnostic and prognostic abilities, of six publicly available brain age prediction packages using data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Baseline brain age significantly differed between groups consisting of individuals with normal cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimers Disease for all packages, but with comparable performance to gray matter volume. Further, estimates were not centered around zero for cognitively normal subjects and showed considerable variation between packages. Finally, brain age did not show strong correlation with disease onset, memory decline, nor gray matter atrophy within four years from baseline in individuals without neurodegenerative disease. The substantial bias and variability in cross-sectional predictions, combined with the weak associations between brain age and longitudinal changes in memory performance or grey matter volume, suggested limited validity of current brain age estimates as a biomarker for biological aging.","NA","medrxiv",1742335770989

Here we present an integrated computational-experimental workflow, combining static structure analyses, molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro physicochemical and functional assays to generate rational designs of FW mutations for modulating antibody stability and activity. We first showed that recent antibody-specific language models lacked insights in FW mutagenesis, in comparison to approaches which utilised antibody structure information. Using the widely-used breast cancer therapeutic trastuzumab as a use case, we designed stabilising mutants which were distal to the CDR and preserved the antibodys functionality to engage its cognate antigen (HER2) and induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Interestingly, guided by local backbone motions predicted using molecular dynamics simulations, we designed a FW mutation on the trastuzumab light chain which retained antigen-binding effects but lost Fab-mediated and Fc-mediated effector functions. This highlighted effects of FW on immunological functions engendered in distal areas of the antibody, and the importance to consider attributes other than binding affinity when assessing antibody function. Our approach incorporates interdomain dynamics and distal effects between FW and the Fc domains, expands the scope of antibody engineering beyond the CDR, and underscores the importance of a holistic perspective that considers the entire antibody structure as a whole in optimising antibody stability, developability and function.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

In this study, we uncover synergistic interactions between WEE1 small- molecule inhibitors and defects in mRNA translation, mediated by activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) through the kinase GCN2. Using a pooled CRISPRi screen, we identify GSPT1 and ALKBH8 as factors whose depletion confer hypersensitivity to the WEE1 inhibitor, AZD1775. We demonstrate that this synergy depends on ISR activation, which is induced by the off-target activity of WEE1 inhibitors. Furthermore, PROTAC-based WEE1 inhibitors and molecular glues show reduced or no ISR activation, suggesting potential strategies to minimise off-target toxicity. Our findings reveal that certain WEE1 inhibitors elicit dual toxicity via ISR activation and genotoxic stress, with ISR activation being independent of WEE1 itself or cell-cycle status. This dual mechanism highlights opportunities for combination therapies, such as pairing WEE1 inhibitors with agents targeting the mRNA translation machinery. This study also underscores the need for more precise WEE1 targeting strategies to mitigate off-target effects, with implications for optimising the therapeutic potential of WEE1 inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Historically, their conformational states have been defined by the DFG motif: DFG-in and DFG-out. However, this binary paradigm overlooks the broader conformational heterogeneity of apo STKs, which encompasses multiple metastable states within an expanded DFG-Phe ensemble. We introduced a novel nomenclature that integrates the dynamics of the DFG-Phe, activation loop, and C-helix, highlighting how these regions respond to various ensemble perturbations (e.g., mutations, ligand binding, and protein- protein interactions). A major bottleneck in studying kinases lies in sampling their wide-ranging conformations because static snapshots often remain trapped in specific free energy minima, limiting traditional molecular dynamics simulations from exploring multiple functionally relevant states starting from a single structure. To accelerate conformational sampling, we introduce a computational framework that integrates AlphaFold, machine learning, physics-based simulations, and Markov state modeling. Rather than focusing on single-structure snapshots or structural hypotheses generated by protein structure prediction models, our framework captures shifts in conformational populations under varying perturbations, shedding light on both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transitions. A key innovation lies in our machine learning algorithms, which capture slowly varying structural features to uncover hidden states and generate latent representations of conformational motions across different kinase domains. The physics-refined structural ensemble sampled from the latent layers is then used to launch new simulations that more comprehensively explore the full conformational landscape than traditional molecular simulation approaches. By capturing how these conformational shifts influence downstream protein-protein interactions, conformational allostery, and cryptic pocket formation, our accelerated simulation framework provides deeper insights into STK mechanisms and enables the development of new therapeutic modalities. Finally, by uniting our comprehensive conformational definition with an AI-accelerated molecular simulation strategy, we capture generalized conformational dynamics in kinases and how their heterogeneity is influenced by ensemble-level perturbations. This framework can be extended to investigate broader protein families--such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs)--where functional outcomes are dictated by conformational heterogeneity.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

This study evaluates the immunogenicity of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAV) expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, administered intramuscularly and intranasally in mice. Both delivery methods of AAV5-spike, AAV5-spike stabilized trimer as well as AAV44.9-spike elicited robust serum anti-spike antibodies within 8-12 weeks, with high levels of anti-spike antibodies sustained for over a year. Comparison of mouse serum antibodies 16 weeks post intramuscular or intranasal AAV5 administration demonstrated similar SARS-CoV-2 spike binding neutralizing activity in vitro. Analysis of changes in cellular immunity by ELISpot at 12 weeks post-AAV spike transduction revealed interferon-{gamma} induction in response to peptide challenge. Despite a decline in AAV vector DNA at the injection site, the persistence of anti-spike antibodies demonstrated that AAV-vectors can elicit lasting immune responses, highlighting nasal AAV administration as a potential strategy to block respiratory virus infections.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

PRC2 deposits the repressive chromatin mark H3 lysine 27 tri-methyl (H3K27me3) through a read-write loop that involves direct interactions between PRC2 and H3K27me3. According to current models, the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop is initiated by the PRC2 subunits JARID2 and PALI1 that mimic H3K27me3. However, it is unknown what restricts the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop from spreading H3K27me3 indefinitely. To answer this question, we generated mutant mice where PRC2 subunits cannot mimic H3K27me3. Unexpectedly, the mutations led to a homeotic transformation characteristic of a Polycomb gain-of-function in vivo and the spread of H3K27me3 beyond Polycomb domains in stem cells. Collectively, we show that H3K27me3 mimicry evolved to compete against the PRC2-H3K27me3 read-write loop in a process that restrains PRC2 and restricts the spread of Polycomb domains.

Complementarity to the miRNA seed region (miRNA nucleotides 2-7) is typically both necessary and sufficient for repression. Here, we investigate unusual sites with extensive complementarity to the miRNA 3' region (nucleotide 9 and onwards) but without complementarity to the seed. Top 3'-only sites bind as well as top canonical sites and impart similar repression, which can be further boosted by as few as 2-3 additional pairs to the miRNA seed. Despite these similarities, 3'-only sites have slower association and dissociation rates than seed-matched sites. They also impart different conformations to bound AGO-miRNA complexes than do seed-matched sites, and individual miRNAs differ substantially with respect to how well they bind their respective 3'-only sites. Thus, pairing to the seed is not required for binding and repression, or for a target to gain access to the 3' region of the guide. Overall, for those miRNAs which recognize 3'-only sites, those sites are estimated to constitute 0.5-1% of the endogenous targetome, a proportion resembling that of other rare but functional site types, such as 3'-compensatory sites.

Their assembly occurs in ER regions enriched with seipin which, through its homooligomeric ring-like structure, facilitates neutral lipid nucleation. In yeast, seipin (Sei1) partners with Ldb16, Ldo45 (yeast homologue of human LDAF1) and Ldo16, which regulate LD formation and consumption. How the molecular architecture of the yeast seipin complex and its interaction with regulatory proteins adapt to different metabolic conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Ldb16 regions contribute differently to recruiting Ldo45 and Ldo16 to the seipin complex. Using an in-vivo site-specific photo-crosslinking approach, we further show that Ldo45 resides at the center of the seipin ring both in the absence and presence of neutral lipids. Interestingly, neutral lipid synthesis leads to the recruitment of Ldo45 but not Ldo16 to the complex. Our findings suggest that the seipin complex serves as a pre-assembled scaffold for lipid storage that can be remodeled in response to increased neutral lipid availability.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

However, these studies hardly encompass cartilaginous fishes deeply isolated from the rest of vertebrates, which hinders the comprehensive view of vertebrate sex determination. Here, we produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies of egg-laying shark species and comparatively investigated genome sequences and transcriptome profiles across diverse cartilaginous fishes. Sex chromosome identification, supported by cytogenetic experiments, elucidated the homology of X chromosomes between sharks and rays as well as an extensively degenerating Y chromosome harboring no male-specific genes. These sex chromosomes scarcely included orthologs of previously documented sex determining genes. Transcriptomic analyses combined with histology of embryonic gonads revealed female-biased expressions of X-linked genes including those implicated in TGF-{beta} and IGF signaling pathways, which are attributed to their incomplete dosage compensation. Our findings indicate that sharks and rays share the oldest vertebrate sex chromosomes that originated around 300 million years ago and the dosage-dependent sex determination mechanism comprised of distinct molecules from other vertebrates. This study highlights the antiquity of sex chromosomes and uniqueness of sex determination mechanisms in sharks and rays, which advance our understanding on evolutionary plasticity of vertebrate sex determination.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

The disease is caused by the self-templated misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) into toxic species, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and death. We evaluated a novel epigenetic regulation approach using Zinc Finger Repressors (ZFRs) to ablate PrP expression at the transcriptional level. When delivered using adeno-associated virus (AAV), ZFRs potently and specifically reduced prion mRNA expression by >95% in vitro and to near undetectable levels within single neurons in vivo. In wildtype mice, ZFRs stably lowered neuronal PrP expression throughout the central nervous system for at least 17 months. In mice inoculated with misfolded PrP, AAV-ZFRs given at either early or late disease stages profoundly extended lifespan, significantly reduced PrP in the brain, and improved an array of molecular, histological, biomarker, and behavioral readouts. Finally, we delivered a ZFR targeting the human prion gene (PRNP) to cynomolgus monkeys using a novel blood-brain-barrier penetrant AAV capsid. Extensive bulk and single-cell assessments revealed widespread ZFR expression and PRNP repression in all 35 brain regions assessed, providing the first demonstration of epigenetic regulation across the nonhuman primate neuraxis following a single intravenous (IV) dose. These results highlight the potential of a one-time IV administered ZFR treatment for prion disease and other neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

MRN senses DSBs through a tight clamp-like sensing state with closed coiled-coil domains, but auto-inhibited MRE11 nuclease. NBS1 wraps around the MRE11 dimer, with NBS1's ATM recruitment motif sequestered by binding to the regulatory RAD50 S site, necessitating an allosteric switch underlying ATM activation.

While deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have demonstrated hierarchical feature extraction similar to biological systems (DiCarlo and Cox, 2007; Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016), recent findings reveal a growing discrepancy: DCNNs with higher object categorization accuracy paradoxically show worse performance at predicting neural responses (Xu and Vaziri-Pashkam, 2021; Linsley et al., 2023). Using a large-scale human electroencephalography (EEG) dataset (n=10, 82,160 trials), we investigate whether this discrepancy arises because human neural EEG signals predominantly reflect scene segmentation processes rather than high-level, category-specific object representations. We trained DCNNs to perform object recognition using visual diets ([~]1 million training images across 292 object categories) with systematically varying scene segmentation demands: objects-only (pre-segmented), background-silhouette (explicit boundaries), original/background-only images (requiring full segmentation). Despite substantial differences in categorization accuracy (27-53%), all trained models showed remarkably uniform encoding performance, with peak correlations with neural data at [~]0.1s post-stimulus. Layer-wise analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between categorization accuracy and encoding performance, with earlier network layers better predicting EEG responses than deeper layers specialized for object categorization. This dissociation suggests that EEG signals primarily reflect fundamental scene parsing mechanisms rather than object-specific representations, explaining the growing discrepancy between DCNNs increasing categorization performance but deteriorating neural prediction performance.

Significance StatementThis research provides a novel perspective on human electroencephalography (EEG) signals during visual processing through systematic manipulation of scene segmentation demands in deep neural networks. Using a large-scale dataset of 82,160 EEG trials and 20 trained DCNNs, we demonstrate that EEG responses primarily reflect early visual processing involved in breaking down and organizing visual scenes (scene segmentation/parsing) rather than high-level object recognition. This finding helps explain previously observed discrepancies between DCNNs categorization performance and neural prediction accuracy, suggesting that improving models ability to segment scenes, rather than simply recognizing isolated objects, may better align artificial and biological visual processing.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

This code enabled the transfer of prior knowledge to solve new tasks. We identify specific circuit mechanisms underlying this rapid generalization. We show that the seemingly random changes in individual neuronal activity over time and across environments result from structured circuit-level processes, governed by the dynamics of local inhibition and cross-regional cell assemblies, respectively.

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

However, resistance frequently emerges, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of nucleotide regulation. Here, we harness uridine salvage and CRISPR-Cas9 screening to reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. We identify several factors and report that pyrimidine synthesis can continue in the absence of coenzyme Q (CoQ), the canonical electron acceptor in de novo synthesis. We further investigate NUDT5 and report its conserved interaction with PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis. We show that in the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis siphons the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, promoting resistance to chemotherapy. Intriguingly, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT appears to be disrupted by PRPP, highlighting intricate allosteric regulation.

This uncertainty poses a difficult challenge for adaptive decision making, as failing to preserve relevant information can prevent us from making good choices later on. One solution to this challenge is to store detailed memories of individual experiences that can be flexibly accessed whenever their details become relevant. By allowing us to store and recall specific events in vivid detail, the human episodic memory system provides exactly this capacity. Yet whether and how this ability supports adaptive behavior is poorly understood. Here we aimed to determine whether people use detailed episodic memories to make decisions when future task demands are uncertain. We hypothesized that the episodic memory systems ability to store events in great detail allows us to reference any of these details if they later become relevant. We tested this hypothesis using a novel decision making task where participants encoded individual events with multiple features and later made decisions based on these features to maximize their earnings. Across four experiments (total n = 472), we found that participants referenced episodic memories during decisions in feature-rich environments, and that they did so specifically when it was unclear at encoding which features would be needed in the future. Overall, these findings reveal a fundamental adaptive function of episodic memory, showing how its rich representational capacity enables flexible decision making under uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Nuclear RNAs (nucRNAs) have been proposed to be important regulators of such changes; however, the type, abundance, and functions of nucRNAs during neurodifferentiation remain largely unexplored. Here, we integrate multi-omic data generated in the frame of the Functional ANnoTation Of the Mammalian genome (FANTOM6) to chart 3D genome, RNA-DNA contactome, and transcriptome changes during in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells to neural stem cells and neurons. We find that most RNA-DNA contacts form between transcripts and their source gene; however, a group of intronic RNAs engages in chromatin contacts with distal loci on the same or on different chromosomes. We detect such trans-contacting intronic RNAs (TIRs) in all cell types profiled by FANTOM6, but most prominently in neurons, where TIRs are produced from highly expressed, neuron-specific, long (mean length: 400 kilobases, kb) protein-coding genes. In neurons, TIRs accumulate in the nucleus forming large clouds around their source loci, and they occasionally spread across the nucleus. TIRs engage in local and distal contacts with a set of genomic regions (named TIR-contacted regions or TIRCs) carrying much shorter (mean length: 30 kb) neuron-specific genes that become upregulated and move towards the nuclear center during neurodifferentiation, forming high-connectivity hubs. TIR source genes, and especially their introns, are strongly enriched in risk loci for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Notably, knockdown of a single TIR by antisense oligonucleotides leads to downregulation of multiple genes implicated in NDDs and of source genes of most other TIRs. We propose that TIRs orchestrate cell type-specific gene expression during neurodifferentiation and might be pathogenically linked to NDDs.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

We gathered two diverse pretraining datasets: one consisting of 19,551 reference genomes, including over 18,000 prokaryotic genomes (115B nucleotides), and another more balanced dataset with 1,354 genomes, including 1,166 prokaryotic and 188 eukaryotic reference genomes (180B nucleotides). We trained five byte-pair encoding tokenizers and pretrained 52 DNA language models, systematically comparing different architectures, hyperparameters, and classification heads. We introduce seqLens, a family of models based on disentangled attention with relative positional encoding, which outperforms state-of-the-art models in 13 of 19 benchmarking phenotypic predictions. We further explore continual pretraining, domain adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to assess trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that relevant pretraining data significantly boosts performance, alternative pooling techniques enhance classification, and larger tokenizers negatively impact generalization.

Human neocortex expansion during evolution has been attributed to an increase in the proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells during development, particularly basal radial glia (bRG). Despite their evolutionary relevance, the genomic changes driving human-specific bRG biology remain uncharacterized. We used comparative chromatin and transcriptional profiling of neural progenitor cells isolated from gorilla, chimpanzee and human cerebral organoids to identify cis-regulatory elements that have gained activity in humans. Focusing specifically on bRG, we discovered that morphoregulatory enhancer activity and gene expression signatures distinguish human bRG from other great apes. Functional analysis of the morphoregulatory genes FAM107A and CNGA3 in human organoids revealed that these genes are required for the morphological complexity of human bRG. Taken together, our interspecies comparison of basal radial glia suggests that human-specific morphoregulatory signatures characterize neocortex evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Therefore, it is critically important to optimize how existing antibiotics act against bacterial infections. Although antibiotic activity is well studied at the single cell level, many infections are caused by spatially structured multicellular populations. In such populations, cellular consumption of scarce nutrients establishes strong spatial variations in their abundance. These nutrient variations have long been hypothesized to help bacterial populations tolerate antibiotics, since single-cell studies show that antibiotic tolerance depends on metabolic activity, and thus, local nutrient availability. Here, we directly test this hypothesis by visualizing cell death in Escherichia coli populations with defined structures upon exposure to nutrient (glucose) and antibiotic (fosfomycin). We find that nutrient availability acts as a bottleneck to antibiotic killing, causing death to propagate through the population as a traveling front---a phenomenon predicted over 20 years ago, but never verified until now. By integrating our measurements with biophysical theory and simulations, we establish quantitative principles that explain how collective nutrient consumption can limit the progression of this ""death front,"" protecting a population from a nominally deadly antibiotic dose. While increasing nutrient supply can overcome this bottleneck, our work reveals that in some cases, excess nutrient can unexpectedly promote the regrowth of resistant cells. Altogether, this work provides a key step toward predicting and controlling antibiotic treatment of spatially structured bacterial populations, yielding fundamental biophysical insights into collective behavior and helping to guide strategies for more effective antibiotic stewardship.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

These channels respond to changes in the membrane potential via conformational changes in their voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) that leads to the opening and closing of the ion conduction pore. Since alternative states of the VSDs are difficult to capture via experimental methods, we investigated the application AlphaFold2 to computationally predict structures in a range of intermediate and endpoint states. By generating 600 models for 32 members of the voltage gated cation channel superfamily we show that AlphaFold2 can predict a range of diverse structures of the VSDs that plausibly represent activated, deactivated and intermediate conformations with more diversity seen for some VSDs compared to others. Modelling the full sequence of pseudo-tetrameric channels also produced a range of diverse states in the pore and intracellular regions that potentially represent physiologically relevant states.

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.

We developed a massively parallel dual reporter assay that enables simultaneous assessment of the intrinsic promoter and enhancer potential exerted by the same sequence. Parallel quantification for thousands of elements reveals that canonical human promoters and enhancers can act as both promoters and enhancers under the same contexts, and that promoter activity may be necessary but not sufficient for enhancer function. We find that regulatory potential is intrinsic to element sequences, irrespective of downstream features typically associated with distinct element classes. Perturbations to element transcription factor binding motifs lead to disruptions in both activities, implicating a shared syntax for the two regulatory functions. Combinations of elements with different minimal promoters reveal reciprocal activity modulation between associated elements and a strong positive correlation between promoter and enhancer functions imply a bidirectional feedback loop used to maintain environments of high transcriptional activity. Finally, our results indicate that the magnitude and balance between promoter and enhancer functions are shaped by both intrinsic sequence properties and contextual regulatory influences, suggesting a degree of plasticity in regulatory action. Our approach provides a new lens for understanding fundamental principles of regulatory element biology.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence and staggering cost, its severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts, study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease, although these results did not statistically replicate between studies. A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly (>91%) white European ancestry Sano GOLD population, and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us (AoU) population.

MethodsWe assessed the reproducibility of the 5,343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population. Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings, we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure.

ResultsFor the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5% in AoU, we consistently observed a significant enrichment (77% - 83%, p < 0.01) of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort. These encompassed 92% of the genes identified in the original study. At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population. Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among self-identified white patients, but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in self-identified black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts. Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study.

ConclusionThese results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis, broadly validating the results of the original analysis. They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies. This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis. Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease.

This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions. Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations, these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity. We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options, both in the form of newly discovered drugs and/or the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates.","NA","medrxiv",1742335770989

This web-based tool, developed by the integration of existing computational approaches, takes an RNA sequence as input and automatically retrieves and aligns sequences homologous to the input (query) RNA sequence through an iterative and structure-agnostic approach. Based on the alignment, this tool statistically assesses whether the query RNA sequence has a conserved RNA structure using covariation analysis. The web server allows the user to efficiently search the sequence of interest against carefully curated, ready-to-use genomic databases to produce a multiple sequence alignment. Using this alignment, our tool either detects the presence of a conserved structural RNA, finds evidence against the presence of a conserved structure, or cannot make any assessment due to a lack of sequence diversity in the alignment.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.

This study presents a unique analysis of the PBMC transcriptomic landscape of COVID-19 and Long-COVID patients at a single-cell resolution. We reconstructed the cell state and communication using differentially expressed gene profiling and ligand-receptor interaction analyses. Our results reveal altered T and NK cell subset proportions, diminished proliferating lymphocyte and B cell signalling capacity, and the expression of exhaustion and cytotoxicity associated genes 1.5 - 2 years post-infection, suggesting incomplete immune recovery. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the immune processes underlying the progression of COVID-19 into a chronic Long-COVID state.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

We identified human-specific epigenetic signatures including cis-regulatory regions and enhancer-promoter interactions and linked them to gene regulatory dynamics. Deep learning models revealed that complex regulatory grammar at cis-regulatory regions, including transcription factor binding sites, local context and higher-order chromatin organization, underlies species and cell type-specific differences. High-resolution Hi-C uncovered unexpected global shifts in 3D genome architecture in chimpanzee and gorilla neural stem cells while topologically associating domains remain remarkably conserved. Notably, species-specific genes interacted with multiple differentially accessible regions, suggesting that synergistic enhancer activation is a key mechanism driving epigenome evolution.

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.

Significance StatementWe demonstrate the use of a chloroplast genome as a synthetic biology platform to test modifications of the universal genetic code. Elimination of 13 of the 64 possible triplet codes (codons) was possible for several essential and/or highly expressed genes without affecting chloroplast function. The technology is mature, paving the way for codon compression of the entire genome and thus enabling further radical rearrangement or expansion of the genetic code.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Here we present the GrimACE, the first fully standardised and automated cage-side monitoring tool for mice, the most widely used animals in research. The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Combining Nirmatrelvir with the GRP78-antagonizing drug candidate HA15 strongly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to a far greater extent than either drug alone, as observed by diminished cytopathic effect, levels of detectable virus RNA, TCID50 titers, accumulation of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), as well as Spike and N proteins. The original SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as an Omicron variant were similarly susceptible towards the drug combination. Other GRP78 inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GRP78 also fortified the antiviral effect of Nirmatrelvir. In a hamster model of COVID-19, the combination of Nirmatrelvir with HA15 alleviated pneumonia-induced pulmonary atelectasis more effectively than the single drugs.

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching in heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving  fast and  slow alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Recently, powerful methods have emerged that leverage third-generation sequencing to map protein-DNA interactions genome-wide. For example, Directed Methylation with Long-read sequencing (DiMeLo-seq) enables mapping of protein-DNA interactions along long, single chromatin fibers, including in highly repetitive genomic regions. However, DiMeLo-seq involves lossy centrifugation-based wash steps that limit its applicability to many sample types. To address this, we developed DiMeLo-cito, a single-tube, wash-free protocol that maximizes the yield and quality of genomic DNA obtained for long-read sequencing. This protocol enables the interrogation of genome-wide protein binding with as few as 100,000 cells and without the requirement of a nuclear envelope, enabling confident measurement of protein-DNA interactions during mitosis. Using this protocol, we detected strong binding of CTCF to mitotic chromosomes in diploid human cells, in contrast with earlier studies in karyotypically unstable cancer cell lines, suggesting that CTCF ""bookmarks"" specific sites critical for maintaining genome architecture across cell divisions. By expanding the capabilities of DiMeLo-seq to a broader range of sample types, DiMeLo-cito can provide new insights into genome regulation and organization.","NA","biorxiv",1742335770989

Early identification of individuals at high risk of severe COVID-19 is key for monitoring and supporting respiratory status and improving outcomes. Therefore, precision tools for early detection of patients at high risk of severe disease can reduce morbidity and mortality. Here we report an untargeted and longitudinal metabolomic study of plasma derived from adult patients with COVID-19. One-carbon metabolism, a pathway previously shown as critical for viral propagation and disease progression, and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment, scored strongly as differentially abundant in patients with severe COVID-19. A follow-up targeted metabolite profiling revealed that one arm of the one-carbon metabolism pathway, the methionine cycle, is a major driver of the metabolic profile associated with disease severity. The methionine cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl group donor important for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and its high abundance was reported to correlate with disease severity. Further, genomic data from the profiled patients revealed a genetic contributor to methionine metabolism and identified the C677T allele of the MTHFR gene as a pre-existing predictor of disease trajectory - patients homozygous for the MTHFR C677T have higher incidence of experiencing severe disease.
