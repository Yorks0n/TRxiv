Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740175714551

Predictive biomarkers and effective therapies are urgently needed for the clinical management of Long COVID. Neurological manifestations (poor memory, brain fog) are frequent, while neurodamage and neuroinflammatory markers UCHL1, GFAP and NFL were found to be increased in some but not all Long COVID cohorts. However, a direct link between two major Long COVID disease mechanisms, viral persistence and coagulation defects, and CNS damage is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of combined anticoagulant (Asaflow + Clopidogrel) vs. antiviral (Paxlovid) treatment upon clinical outcome and neurodamage markers in Long COVID patients. Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that second-line antiviral treatment is the single best predictor of clinical recovery in a real-world Long COVID cohort (n=106) with long-term (220 person-years) follow-up. Our results support a putative role for viral persistence in Long COVID pathogenesis but also indicate a large therapeutic window for Paxlovid and other antivirals. A rapid decline in neurodamage markers (GFAP/NFL) upon antiviral treatment suggests CNS damage in Long COVID might be therapeutically targeted and should be considered in ongoing and future clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1740175714551

Currently, limited information exists about long-term oral health manifestations in COVID-19 patients with limited healthcare access.

MethodsWe conducted a sequential, cross-sectional study (December 2020-March 2024) to assess how racial/ethnic differences (Black/Hispanic vs White/Asian) and health disparities affect oral and non-oral long COVID symptoms and their relationship with COVID-19 vaccination. We retrospectively reviewed patients oral health record from University of Illinois Chicago dental clinics before vaccination (December 2020; N=1150; Covid+/- N=575/group) and after vaccination (December 2021; N=592; Covid+/- N=292/group). Participants were recruited in two separate prospective groups of COVID-19 positive subjects (February-April 2021; pre-vaccination: N=158; January-March 2024; post-vaccination: N=171), we examined clinical indicators of oral (periodontal and salivary glands) and non-oral (neurologic) sequalae 3-6 months after initial exposure. We measured viral S protein by flow cytometry and quantified inflammatory markers, viral entry receptors, and oral viral load to correlate molecular, and cellular changes in COVID-19 positive subjects before and after vaccination.

ResultsOur results identified racial disparity indicating oral associated post-acute sequelae (PASC) primarily manifested as periodontal (gum) disease (COVID-19 positive: 73.1{+/-}18.9% vs COVID-19 negative: 33.1{+/-}14.3%) and correlated with higher rates of dry mouth (57.5%), taste disturbance (47%), and smell loss (20%). Vaccination reduced oral PASC in COVID-19 positive subjects; however, periodontal disease indicators persisted compared to the COVID-19 negative group. Notably, 3-6 months post-infection, while SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) transcript was rarely detected in saliva ([~]6%), its protein was commonly detected ([~]70%) in the COVID-19 positive subjects indicating incomplete viral clearance. This correlates with significantly higher salivary expression of viral entry receptors (ACE2, and TRMPSS2), and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-8), in COVID-19 positive subjects. This finding was further supported by higher prevalence of other oral viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (70.5%), Herpes Simplex Virus (8.1%), and Human Papillomavirus (17.5%) in COVID-19 positive subjects.

InterpretationCOVID-19 history significantly correlates with severe oral health complications in predominantly Black communities, while vaccination reduced but did not eliminate these issues. The oral cavity serves as a long-term viral reservoir, and periodontal inflammation with increased oral viral presence in COVID-positive patients may increase susceptibility to oral and non-oral viral diseases and identify risk for long COVID.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Blood analysis showed that mains differences observed in humoral, viral, and biological biomarkers were associated with the initial COVID-19 severity, rather than being specifically linked to PASC. However, patients with PASC displayed altered CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell subsets, with higher cytokine-secreting cells and increased terminally differentiated CD45RA+ effector memory T cells (TEMRA). Elevated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells responsive to nucleocapsid/membrane proteins with a TEMRA phenotype were also observed. A random forest model identified these features and initial symptom duration as top variables discriminating PASC, achieving over 80% classification accuracy.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Here, we challenge the ability of a recently developed LLM-based platform, AI co-scientist, to generate high-level hypotheses by posing a question that took years to resolve experimentally but remained unpublished: How could capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands (cf-PICIs) spread across bacterial species? Remarkably, AI co-scientists top-ranked hypothesis matched our experimentally confirmed mechanism: cf-PICIs hijack diverse phage tails to expand their host range. We critically assess its five highest-ranked hypotheses, showing that some opened new research avenues in our laboratories. We benchmark its performance against other LLMs and outline best practices for integrating AI into scientific discovery. Our findings suggest that AI can act not just as a tool but as a creative engine, accelerating discovery and reshaping how we generate and test scientific hypotheses.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that underlie much of the evolutionary flexibility of bacteria. Evolving plasmids face selective pressures on their hosts, but also compete within the cell for replication, making them an ideal system for studying the joint dynamics of multilevel selection. While theory indicates that within-cell selection should matter for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of within-cell plasmid fitness and its consequences has remained elusive. Here we measure the within-cell fitness of competing plasmids and characterize drift and selective dynamics. We achieve this by the controlled splitting of synthetic plasmid dimers to create balanced competition experiments. We find that incompatible plasmids co-occur for longer than expected due to methylation-based plasmid eclipsing. During this period of co-occurrence, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell selective advantage over their competing plasmids, leading to preferential fixation of silent plasmids. When the transcribed gene is beneficial to the cell, for example an antibiotic resistance gene, there is a cell-plasmid fitness tradeoff mediated by the dominance of the beneficial trait. Surprisingly, more dominant plasmid-encoded traits are less likely to fix but more likely to initially invade than less dominant traits. Taken together, our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by dynamics at two levels, with a transient, but critical, contribution of within-cell fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

In this study, we established a working model to investigate chromosome dynamics in S. aureus using a Fluorescent Repressor-Operator System (FROS), which enabled precise localization of specific chromosomal loci. This approach revealed that the S. aureus cell cycle and chromosome replication cycle are not coupled, with cells exhibiting two segregated origins of replication at the start of the cell cycle. The chromosome has a specific origin-terminus-origin conformation, with origins localizing near the membrane, towards the tip of each hemisphere, or the ""cell poles"". We further used this system to assess the role of various proteins with a role in S. aureus chromosome biology, focusing on the ParB-parS and SMC-ScpAB systems. Our results demonstrate that ParB binds five parS chromosomal sequences and the resulting complexes influence chromosome conformation, but play a minor role in chromosome compaction and segregation. In contrast, the SMC-ScpAB complex plays a key role in S. aureus chromosome biology, contributing to chromosome compaction, segregation and spatial organization. Additionally, we systematically assessed and compared the impact of proteins linking chromosome segregation to cell division--Noc, FtsK, SpoIIIE and XerC--on origin and terminus number and positioning. This work provides a comprehensive study of the factors governing chromosome dynamics and organization in S. aureus, contributing to our knowledge on chromosome biology of spherical bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

However, prioritizing causal common and rare non-coding variants in human disease, and understanding how selective pressures have shaped the non-coding genome, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predicted the effects of 15 million variants with deep learning models trained on single- cell ATAC-seq across 132 cellular contexts in adult and fetal brain and heart, producing nearly two billion context-specific predictions. Using these predictions, we distinguish candidate causal variants underlying human traits and diseases and their context-specific effects. While common variant effects are more cell-type-specific, rare variants exert more cell-type-shared regulatory effects, with selective pressures particularly targeting variants affecting fetal brain neurons. To prioritize de novo mutations with extreme regulatory effects, we developed FLARE, a context- specific functional genomic model of constraint. FLARE outperformed other methods in prioritizing case mutations from autism-affected families near syndromic autism-associated genes; for example, identifying mutation outliers near CNTNAP2 that would be missed by alternative approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating single-cell maps with population genetics and deep learning-based variant effect prediction to elucidate mechanisms of development and disease--ultimately, supporting the notion that genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders are predominantly rare.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

We collated evidence for these pathways through literature reviews. Our reviews found no studies directly linking climate change and tuberculosis, warranting research to build evidence for action.

In this study, we integrated single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate an atlas of cell types and expression domains during the early stages of wheat spike development. We characterized spatiotemporal expression of 99 genes by smFISH in 48,225 cells at the early transition (W1.5), late double ridge (W2.5) and lemma primordia (W3.25) stages. These cells were clustered into 21 different expression domains, including four beneath the developing spikelets and three different meristematic regions, which were consistent across spikelets and sections. We also identified genes differentially expressed during the transition of the inflorescence meristem into a terminal spikelet. The smFISH study was complemented by the scRNA-seq profiling of 26,009 cells from W2.5 and W3.25 that were clustered into 23 distinct cell types.

Such mechanisms underlie the epigenetic silencing of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) by prolonged cold. Here, we show a temperature-dependent transition in local chromatin structure at the H3K27me3 nucleation region, from a modality active for transcription to a state that can be Polycomb silenced. In vivo chromatin measurements and coarse-grained simulations at near-atomistic resolution show the active transcription state is characterized by a highly dynamic nucleosome arrangement that exposes the FLC TSS. Cold exposure then changes the chromatin structure by reducing nucleosome dynamics and re-positioning the +1 nucleosome, leading to transcriptional repression. This local chromatin transition partially depends on VRN1, a non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Loss of VRN1 results in hyperaccumulation of H2A.Z, more dynamic nucleosomes and an inability to accumulate H2Aub and H3K27me3. Our work highlights how local nucleosome dynamics link to chromatin structure transitions to integrate temperature inputs into epigenetic switching mechanisms in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

However, most underlying gene discovery efforts have focused on individuals of European ancestry, limiting insights into genetic risks across diverse populations. To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

The non-pathogenic soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida is a promising host for exploring synthetic methylotrophy due to its versatile metabolism. In this work, we implemented synthetic serine cycle variants in P. putida for methanol assimilation combining modular engineering and growth-coupled selection, whereby methanol assimilation supported biosynthesis of the essential amino acid serine. The serine cycle forms acetyl-coenzyme A from C1 molecules without carbon loss but has bottlenecks that hinder engineering efforts. We adopted three synthetic variants (serine-threonine cycle, homoserine cycle, and modified serine cycle) that yield serine in a methanol-dependent fashion to overcome these challenges. By dividing these metabolic designs into functional modules, we systematically compared their performance for implementation in vivo. Additionally, we harnessed native pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent dehydrogenases for engineering methylotrophy. Recursive rewiring of synthetic and native activities revealed novel metabolic topologies for methanol utilization, termed enhanced serine-threonine cycle, providing a blueprint for engineering C1 assimilation in non-model heterotrophic bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

However, the full potential of real-time metagenomics remains largely unfulfilled due to a lack of accessible, open-source bioinformatic tools.

We present MARTi (Metagenomic Analysis in Real-Time), an innovative open-source software designed for the real-time analysis, visualisation, and exploration of metagenomic data. MARTi supports various classification methods, including BLAST, Centrifuge, and Kraken2, letting users customise parameters and utilise their own databases for taxonomic classification and antimicrobial resistance analysis. With a user-friendly, browser-based graphical interface, MARTi provides dynamic, real-time updates on community composition and AMR gene identification.

MARTis architecture and operational flexibility make it suitable for diverse research applications, ranging from in-field analysis to large-scale metagenomic studies. Using both simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate MARTis performance in read classification, taxon detection, and relative abundance estimation. By bridging the gap between sequencing and actionable insights, MARTi marks a significant advance in the accessibility and functionality of real-time metagenomic analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

However, isotropic resolution for a centimeter-sized sample has only been achieved with slow and often aberrated, axially scanned light sheets, resulting in a low resolution of several micrometers. Here, we introduce a compact, high-speed light sheet fluorescence microscope with isotropic sub-micron resolution optimized for cleared tissue. We introduce three major opto-mechanical innovations using off-the-shelf optics to achieve an isotropic resolution of 850 nm across samples up to 1 cm3 and refractive indices ranging from 1.33 to 1.56. We show that combining an air objective and a meniscus lens achieves an axially swept light sheet with sub-micron diffraction-limited resolution, free of aberrations. The effective field of view is increased 2-fold by correcting the field curvature of the light sheet with a concave mirror in the remote focusing unit. Furthermore, the imaging speed is enhanced 10-fold by adapting the light sheet's motion with a closed-loop feedback, reaching 100 frames per second while maintaining isotropic resolution across the large field of view. Finally, we showcase the performance of our light sheet system for imaging from subcellular up to centimeter scale in cleared mouse cochlea and brain.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Here, we show that syntaxin-6 acts at early stages of prion disease in experimental mice by increasing disease transmission risk following inoculation with low prion doses. Conversely, syntaxin-6 does not affect prion propagation kinetics or toxicity during established disease. Syntaxin-6 manipulation in cellular models profoundly alters the subcellular distribution and morphologies of disease-related PrP and modifies prion export.

Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties, including controllability. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification, which is a fundamental principle in control theory. The incorporation of perturbation inputs is therefore essential for precise characterization of brain dynamics. In this study, we combine a perturbation input paradigm with a network control theory framework and propose a novel method for estimating the controllability Gramian matrix in a simple, theoretically grounded manner. This method provides insights into brain dynamics, including overall controllability (quantified by the Gramians eigenvalues) and specific controllable directions (represented by its eigenvectors). As a proof of concept, we applied our method to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) responses across four motor-related states and two resting states. We found that states such as open-eye rest, closed-eye rest, and motor-related states were more effectively differentiated using controllable directions than overall controllability. However, certain states, like motor execution and motor imagery, remained indistinguishable using these measures. These findings indicate that some brain states differ in their intrinsic control properties as dynamical systems, while others share similarities that make them less distinguishable. This study underscores the value of control theory-based analyses in quantitatively how intrinsic brain states shape the brains responses to stimulation, providing deeper insights into the dynamic properties of these states. This methodology holds promise for diverse applications, including characterizing individual response variability and identifying conditions for optimal stimulation efficacy.

Significant statementThe brain can be viewed as a control system transitioning between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Previous studies using network control theory mostly evaluated brain dynamics without external perturbations, neglecting their role in accurate system identification. This study integrates perturbation inputs with network control theory to propose a method for estimating the controllability Gramian, thereby providing insights into brain dynamics. We applied this approach to TMS-induced EEG responses in motor-related and resting states. Our findings show that controllable directions (eigenvectors) allow better discrimination between states than overall controllability. Our method can quantitatively assess brain state differences, and has potential applications in characterizing individual response variability and optimizing stimulation efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

To uncover factors that promote viability in cells with frequent centrosome amplification and multipolar division, we conducted an unbiased Drosophila genetic screen. In 642 mutagenized lines, we exploited the ability of intestinal papillar cells to form and function despite multipolar divisions. Our top hit is an unnamed gene, CG3168. We name this gene synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2, reflecting homology to human Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2 (SV2) proteins. GFP-tagged SV2 localizes to the plasma membrane. In cells with amplified centrosomes, SV2 positions membrane-adjacent centrosomes, which prevents severe errors in chromosome alignment and segregation.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing have enabled whole-genome sequencing of individuals or subspecies, facilitating the identification of population-specific variations. Detecting population-specific TE insertions at scale is crucial for understanding species-specific phenotypic traits. However, tools for constructing comprehensive pan-TE databases remain limited. To address this gap, we develop panHiTE, a population-scale TE detection and annotation tool with several core innovations. panHiTE features a deep learning-based long terminal repeat retrotransposon (LTR-RT) detection algorithm, outperforming existing tools in both sensitivity and precision. It also introduces a novel de-redundancy algorithm, which eliminates highly divergent redundant TE instances, significantly reducing the size of the TE library. Additionally, panHiTE can detect low-copy TEs, which are overlooked in individual genome analyses and absent from existing databases due to their rarity. Furthermore, panHiTE allows for TE-gene association analysis, enabling comprehensive insights into TE-driven phenotypic variation. panHiTE, powered by a Nextflow pipeline, enables efficient and scalable TE detection in large plant genomes and has successfully been applied to hundreds of plant population genomes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Reproductive isolation can be generated by different mechanisms that have been extensively characterized, yet how their interactions affect speciation remains largely unknown. Here, we explicitly model the interaction of three key mechanisms (local adaptation, mate choice and genetic hybrid incompatibilities) quantifying their relative contribution to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We modeled two populations exchanging migrants using Fisher Geometric Model for local adaptation, phenotype matching for mate choice, and multiple pairs of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMI). All three mechanisms were determined by the same set of loci, creating conditions for interactions between barriers both at the genetic and population levels. We found no cases where the three barriers evolved. Instead, two barriers could evolve depending on the migration rate: either local adaptation and genetic incompatibilities for limited migration, or local adaptation and mate choice for higher migration. Our results showed that local adaptation due to ecological differentiation was the first to evolve and by far the most effective reproductive barrier. Finally, we demonstrated that in a polygenic model, populations could become locally adapted and evolve strict mate choice, yet they would not accumulate incompatibilities provided that there was sufficient gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

This question can be tested by studying colonisation of environments with little to no pre-existing life. Here, we investigated the functional basis of microbial colonisation in the forelands of a maritime Antarctic and an alpine Swiss retreating glacier, by integrating quantitative ecology, genome-resolved metagenomics, and biogeochemical measurements. Habitat generalists and opportunists rapidly colonize both forelands and persist across soil depth and decadal chronosequences that serve as proxies for temporal community dynamics. These microbes are metabolically flexible chemotrophic aerobes that overcome oligotrophic conditions by using both organic and inorganic compounds, including atmospheric trace gases and sulfur substrates, for energy and carbon acquisition. They co-exist with metabolically flexible early-colonising opportunists and metabolically restricted later-colonising specialists, including photosynthetic Cyanobacteria, ammonia-oxidising archaea, and obligate predatory and symbiotic bacteria, that exhibit narrower habitat distributions. Analysis of 589 species-level metagenome-assembled genomes reveals early colonisation both by generalists and opportunists is strongly associated with metabolic flexibility. Field- and laboratory-based biogeochemical measurements reveal the activity of metabolically flexible microbes rapidly commenced in the forelands. Altogether, these findings suggest primary succession in glacial foreland soils is driven by self-sufficient metabolically flexible bacteria that mediate chemosynthetic primary production and likely provide a more hospitable soil environment for subsequent colonisation.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Bayes Factor analyses identified both convergent zones responding to multiple domains and selective zones responding to single domains. Results revealed a hierarchical convergence architecture, with a multi-domain convergence zone in bilateral dorsal anterior insula surrounded by zones showing progressively increasing convergence. Functional decoding and coactivation analyses further support the insulas role as a convergence hub, while cytoarchitectonic and neurotransmitter profiling characterizes the potential neuroanatomical underpinnings subserving convergent and domain-selective function. Overall, our results demonstrate a structured functional topography in the insula that bridges specialized and convergent processing, providing a potential neural basis for how diverse information streams combine into unified subjective experiences.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

In general practice in England up to one-in-two nursing posts are predicted to be unfilled by 2030/31, with Wales similarly threatened. This is reflected internationally. Limited attention has been paid to how cultural and structural issues affect retention of nurses in general practice. The aim of our study is to understand factors that challenge retention and support nurses to stay in general practice.

MethodsWe conducted an exploratory qualitative interview study with n=41 with members of nursing teams working in, or who have worked in, general practice as well as nurse leaders associated with general practice across England and Wales. Recruitment was through professional and social media networks and snowballing techniques. Data were collected between October 2023-June 2024 and analysed following framework analysis. University of York ethics approval (Ref: HSRGC/2023/586/A) was gained. The study was funded by the General Nursing Council Trust.

ResultsRecognition of value of nurses working in general practice was central to the retention of nurses at all levels of practice and was affected by structural and cultural issues and reflected in several themes: The essence of nursing in general practice; The commodification and deprofessionalisation of nursing in general practice; Opportunities for development; Employment of nurses outside of the National Health Service; Lack of voice, precarity of position and lack of recourse; Tipping points.

ConclusionCultural and structural issues impacted on retention of nurses in general practice. While some supported retention, others revealed deep-seated, complex issues which require addressing at practice, local and national organisational levels. Nurses in general practice experience factors which leave them vulnerable and underserved.

Hippocampus structure and function are highly susceptible to pollutants and associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development. Therefore, we investigated associations between residential segregation, air pollutants, hippocampal neurobiology, and PTSD in recent trauma survivors. Methods: Participants (N = 278; 34% non-Hispanic white, 46% Non-Hispanic Black, 16% Hispanic) completed multimodal neuroimaging two weeks after trauma. Yearly averages of air pollutants (PM2.5 and NO2) and racial/economic segregation (Index of Concentration at the Extremes) were derived from each participants address. Linear models assessed if air pollutants mediated associations between segregation and hippocampal volume, threat reactivity, or parahippocampal cingulum fractional anisotropy (FA) after covarying for age, sex, income, and 2-week PTSD symptoms. Further models evaluated if pollutants or segregation prospectively predicted PTSD symptoms six months post-trauma. Results: Non-Hispanic Black participants lived in neighborhoods with significantly greater segregation and air pollution compared to Hispanic and non-Hispanic white participants (ps<.001). There was a significant indirect effect of NO2 between segregation and FA values ({beta} = 0.08, 95% CI[0.01, 0.15]), and an indirect effect of PM2.5 between segregation and threat reactivity ({beta} = -0.08, 95% CI[-0.14, -0.01]). There was no direct effect of segregation on hippocampal features. Pollutants and segregation were not associated with PTSD symptoms . Conclusion: Residential segregation is associated with greater air pollution exposure, which is in turn associated with variability in hippocampal features among recent trauma survivors. Further research is needed to assess relationships between other environmental factors and trauma and stress-related disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1740175714551

Although tangible improvements have been made in academic publishing and conference participation, gender imbalances in citations among leading neuroscience journals persist and are increasing with time. Here, we expand upon prior work by providing a more comprehensive analysis of citation practices across fifty journals to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the field as a whole, particularly across different kinds of journals. We first confirm that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than expected if gender were unrelated to citation practices. Further, we demonstrate that this effect is strongest in the most influential journals. We also find that the apparent closure of the gender gap is due to the interaction of three unique, nuanced patterns of citation: one that is characterized by relative overcitation of papers with men as both first and last author; one that is characterized by relative overcitation of women as the last author, and one that is characterized by relative undercitation of women as the first author. In addition, we find that these patterns of citation are not distributed evenly across the field: more prestigious journals tend to have articles with citation gaps favoring men, while less prestigious journals tend to overcite papers with women as last authors. We discuss potential drivers for these patterns and suggest some implications for the field moving forward.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

For astrocytes to serve such purposes, the interactions with synapses in neuronal circuits require a level of specificity beyond overall synaptic support. A systematic mapping of the astrocyte-connectome relationship would enable the testing of these hypotheses - such analysis is however still lacking, in particular for circuits in the cerebral cortex. Here, utilizing previously published connectomic data of more than 200,000 synapses, we systematically analyzed the spatial relation between astrocytes and synapses in mouse somatosensory cortex. We developed a quantitative assessment of astrocyte-synapse proximity, finding that only 22.7% of synapses are contacted by astrocytic processes for more than 50% of their synaptic circumference. This non-ubiquitous astrocytic attachment would render astrocyte-synapse specificity plausible. Astrocytic coverage depended strongly on synapse types, with thalamocortical shaft synapses being the most covered by astrocytic processes. We furthermore observed a strong dependence of astrocytic synaptic coverage on synapse size, which was exclusive for excitatory spine synapses. We then investigated the possible relation of astrocytic synaptic coverage to neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, finding ultrastructural evidence for substantially reduced astrocytic support at synapses consistent with long-term depression, but not for astrocytic coverage dependence on baseline neuronal presynaptic activity. Together, our data demonstrate a high level of specificity of astrocyte-synapse interactions for particular synaptic types. They indicate the potential relevance of astrocytic coverage for synapse stability, in particular for large synapses, suggesting a contribution to long-term maintenance of learned synaptic states. These methods will allow a systematic testing of hypotheses about glial-neuronal interaction in various brain regions, disease models and species including human.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Previous structural studies of Orf9b in isolation revealed a {beta}-sheet-rich homodimer, however, structures of Orf9b in complex with Tom70 revealed a monomeric helical fold. Here, we developed a biophysical model that quantifies how Orf9b switches between these conformations and binds to Tom70, a requirement for suppressing the type 1 interferon response. We used this model to characterize the effect of lipid binding and mutations in variants of concern to the Orf9b:Tom70 equilibrium. We found that the binding of a lipid to the Orf9b homodimer biases the Orf9b monomer:dimer equilibrium towards the dimer by reducing the dimer dissociation rate [~]100-fold. We also found that mutations in variants of concern can alter different microscopic rate constants without significantly affecting binding to Tom70. Together our results highlight how perturbations to different steps in these coupled equilibria can affect the apparent affinity of Orf9b to Tom70, with potential downstream implications for interferon signaling in coronavirus infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Single-cell and spatial sequencing of samples from different developmental timepoints provide data to investigate differentiation but inferring a sequence of differentiation events requires: (1) finding trajectories, or ancestor:descendant relationships, between cells from consecutive timepoints; (2) coarse-graining these trajectories into a differentiation map, or collection of transitions between cell types, rather than individual cells. We introduce Hidden-Markov Optimal Transport (HM-OT), an algorithm that simultaneously groups cells into cell types and learns transitions between these cell types from developmental transcriptomics time series. HM-OT uses low-rank optimal transport to simultaneously align samples in a time series and learn a sequence of clusterings and a differentiation map with minimal total transport cost. We assume that the law governing cell-type trajectories is characterized by the joint law on consecutive time points, tantamount to a Markov assumption on these latent trajectories. HM-OT can learn these clusterings in a fully unsupervised manner or can generate the least-cost cell type differentiation map consistent with a given set of cell type labels. We validate the unsupervised clusters and cell type differentiation map output by HM-OT on a Stereo-seq dataset of zebrafish development, and we demonstrate the scalability of HM-OT to a massive Stereo-seq dataset of mouse embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

A critically important aspect of anaphylaxis pertains to the factors that modulate its severity. The human microbiota is known to influence oral tolerance, but the microbial mechanisms directly involved in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that human saliva harbors peanut-degrading bacteria that metabolize immunodominant allergens (Ara h 1 and Ara h 2) and alter IgE binding. Additionally, we provide in vivo evidence showing that oral bacteria metabolize peanut allergens, influencing systemic allergen exposure and the severity of anaphylaxis. Finally, in a clinical study, we observe that common peanut-degrading bacteria, such as Rothia, from the oral cavity, are more abundant in peanut-allergic patients who exhibit better tolerance to allergen exposure. Altogether, these results demonstrate the role of the human microbiota in modulating IgE-mediated reactions through allergen metabolism. These findings reveal a novel microbial mechanism with potential to prevent, or reduce, the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

But the extent to which substantial spatial differences exist in ATP concentration in the cell remains incompletely known. It is variously argued that ATP diffuses too quickly for large gradients to be established, or that the high rates of ATP production and use (sources and sinks) can support large gradients even with rapid diffusion - and microscopic models and detailed experiments in different specific cases support both pictures. Here we attempt a mesoscopic investigation, using reaction-diffusion modelling in a simple biophysical picture of the cell to attempt to ask, generally, which conditions cause substantial ATP gradients to emerge within eukaryotic cells. If ATP sources (like mitochondria) or sinks (like the nucleus) are spatially clustered, large fold changes in concentration can exist across the cell; if sources and sinks are more spread then rapid diffusion indeed prevents large gradients being established. This dependence holds in model cells of different sizes, suggesting its generality across cell types. Our theoretical work will complement developing intracellular approaches exploring ATP concentration inside eukaryotic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

We identified ten models from Hugging Face that are small in size, easy to install, and light in computation. Across all four gene classification tasks we considered, some of these models have outperformed OpenAI's, demonstrating their potential as viable, or even superior, alternatives. Additionally, we find that fine-tuning these models often does not lead to significant improvements in performance.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

In frogs, however, odontogenesis is delayed, occurring instead during the postembryonic metamorphosis. Nearly all adult frogs have teeth on the upper jaw and lack lower jaw dentition, but a single species re-evolved mandibular teeth. Developmental-genetic mechanisms that underlie tooth formation in frogs are poorly understood, including whether an ancestral program is partially retained in the lower jaw that could facilitate the evolutionary reappearance of lost mandibular teeth. Using a developmental series of an unconventional model species, we assessed 1) if the gene network underlying odontogenic competence is conserved in the late-forming teeth of frogs; 2) if unique keratinized mouthparts, which function as an alternative feeding tool in anuran larvae, impede tooth induction; and 3) if transient tooth rudiments form in the anuran mandible. The tooth development network is conserved in the frog upper jaw, which displays dental expression patterns comparable to those of other vertebrates. There is, however, no evidence of tooth development in the mandible. Teeth emerge before keratinized mouthparts degenerate, but their location may be spatially constrained by keratin, and gene expression patterns of keratinized mouthparts and teeth overlap. We hypothesize that the novel mouthparts of tadpoles did not arise de novo but instead originated by partially co-opting the developmental program that typically mediates true tooth development.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

While the general reaction catalyzed by recombinases is the same in all domains, key differences at the amino acid level can lead to the specialization of this family of proteins. A key example of this is in the domain of Eukarya, which can utilize two different RecA homologs depending on the life cycle stage of the organism, with the activity of Rad51 utilized during mitotic growth and the activity of Dmc1 used during meiosis. Why most eukaryotes utilize two RecA homologs is an open question. A missing piece of information in this story is the identity of RecA homologs before the divergence of Rad51 and Dmc1, which occurred in early eukaryotes. We analyzed sequence data from the Archaeal homolog, RadA, in the Asgard Archaea superphyla. Our findings include evidence for the evolution of a eukaryotic-specific DNA binding site II within the Asgard lineage. We also identify sequence variants within DNA binding loops L1 and L2, part of binding site I, that imply higher mismatch tolerance within the Asgard and DPANN superphylum. These loops are also observed in the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 within Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the last Archaeal ancestor of Rad51 and Dmc1 was more Dmc1-like in character and likely of lower fidelity.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Predicting patterns of diversity under such background selection has received considerable attention, and recent applications were able to explain a large portion of the variation in diversity across the human genome. However, current models have yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, they display inaccuracies in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes [~] -1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest; second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics allowing for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to population size changes, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire distribution of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under non equilibrium demography and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, neglecting population size changes bias predictions of diversity, which then carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Australias geographic isolation, strict biosecurity measures and native dingo populations present a unique model for understanding the spread and evolution of canine viruses. However, aside from a few well-characterised pathogens, genomic data are scarce for many common dog viruses, limiting our understanding of their evolution and disease ecology. Using a metatranscriptomic approach we identified the viruses in dogs and dingoes from various geographical locations across mainland Australia and sample types, revealing 86 vertebrate-associated viruses belonging to 16 distinct species, including a new vesivirus-like species. Many of the viruses identified here have not previously been sequenced in Australia. We identified important dog pathogens associated with canine infectious respiratory disease syndrome--such as canine pneumovirus, canine herpesvirus, and canine respiratory coronavirus--and gastroenteritis, including canine parvovirus, canine coronavirus, and rotavirus A. The sequences of Australian canine viruses often occupied multiple distinct clades phylogenetically and had little geographic structure, suggesting multiple virus introductions and subsequent spread across the country. Notably, we identified the first RNA virus - rotavirus A - in a dingo. This virus was phylogenetically distinct from dog-associated rotavirus A sequences and more closely related to viruses found in humans and bats, indicative of the past cross-species transmission of a reassortant virus into dingoes, and shows dingoes and domestic dogs may have distinct viromes.

Here we characterize multiple interrelated isolating barriers across various developmental stages of nematode sister species Caenorhabditis remanei and Caenorhabditis latens. We quantified F1 hybrid male sterility and characterized multiple phenotypic causes associated with developmental abnormalities in the germline as well as non-germline gonad and somatic tissues, uncovering a complex suite of developmental defects contributing to strong postzygotic reproductive isolation. Despite these multifarious isolating barrier traits, assays testing for interspecies sperm transfer under ""choice"" conditions did not yield evidence of premating isolation. In contrast to other Caenorhabditis species pairs, we also found no evidence that ectopic sperm migration acts as a postmating-prezygotic barrier. The constellation of phenotypic defects in hybrids points to a polygenic or highly pleiotropic basis for hybrid dysfunction and implicates more rapid evolution of intrinsic postzygotic reproductive isolation than prezygotic isolation in these organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

By merging trees from several sentences, we obtain syntax graphs or networks, which display distinct shapes depending on whether the language capability is well-formed, still developing, or pathological. Such graphs make syntactic capacity quantifiable at a systemic level, revealing emerging patterns and universalities. What is the structure of syntax networks during ontogeny in typically developing (TD) children? Do cognitively challenged children develop language through alternative routes? Here we quantify and portray the typical development of syntax networks in Dutch, and find that children affected by Down syndrome, hearing impairment, and specific language impairment initially seem to follow the typical developmental path but eventually halt, culminating in a different linguistic phenotype. Our expanded data set (with almost 50 times more data than earlier studies) and increased mathematical dimensions to quantify network shape enable us to: (i) confirm and refine a proposed sharp transition in language development, (ii) correlate specific network traits with syntax maturation, and (iii) quantify the aspects that fall short in atypical development--suggesting potential diagnostic tools.

This identified genes with conserved/divergent expression patterns, providing a molecular foundation to interrogate species-specific cellular properties. Using this resource, we discovered that the transcription factor JUNB is expressed in human but not mouse progenitors. Through cell-type-specific gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice and human organoids, we demonstrate that JUNB bidirectionally controls human cortical features, including progenitor proliferation rates, neuronal production timing, and total neuronal output. This reveals how cell-type-specific regulation of shared genes during development can drive species-specific cortical features, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cortical evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

We used an RNA sequencing approach over 7 days in vitro (DIV) or mature 21 DIV neurons, comparing neuronal depolarization with potassium chloride (KCl) versus Biccuculine application, a synaptic modality to induce neuronal activity. To further investigate how different activity patterns influence gene transcription in mature neurons, we compared global gene expression in neurons treated with three different and extensively used activation protocols: KCl, Bicuculine (Bic), and TTX withdrawal (TTXw). Our results demonstrate a strong influence of development on activity-dependent gene expression, and showed that different patterns of neuronal activity induce different transcriptional profiles and exhibit distinct temporal dynamics for the same genes. These findings offer novel insights into the complex relationship between neuronal activity and gene expression, shedding light on the context-dependent nature of activity-dependent transcriptional responses.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Studies have often equated the effects of knocking down one synthase with broader SAM-dependent outcomes such as histone methylation or phosphatidylcholine (PC) production. Humans and many other organisms express multiple SAM synthases. Evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses four SAM synthase genes, suggest that the enzymatic source of SAM impacts its function. For instance, loss of sams-1 leads to enhanced heat shock survival and increased lifespan, whereas reducing sams-4 adversely affects heat stress survival. Here, we show that SAMS-1 contributes to a variety of intermediary metabolic pathways, whereas SAMS-4 is more important to generate SAM for methylation reactions. We demonstrate that loss of sams-1 exerts age-dependent effects on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression, mitochondrial metabolites, and may induce mitophagy. We propose a mechanistic model where reduced SAM from SAMS-1 acts through PC to impact mitochondria, thereby enhancing survival during heat stress.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Calcineurin is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic A subunit and a regulatory B subunit. Through downstream effectors, calcineurin signaling drives myriad responses in different organisms. In the fungal pathogenic Cryptococcus species complex that infects humans, calcineurin governs thermotolerance and is essential for growth at high temperature and pathogenesis. In Cryptococcus deneoformans, the underlying molecular functions of this critical signaling cascade are not well understood. In this study, we conducted a genetic screen and identified genetic changes that suppress the requirement for calcineurin during high-temperature growth. Our results identified two mechanisms that bypass the requirement for calcineurin function. The first mechanism involves segmental aneuploidy via both amplification as well as loss of chromosome fragments. The second mechanism involves dominant amino acid substitution mutations in the genes encoding three proteins, Chs6, Imp2, and Cts1, which function in a complex required for septation and budding. Loss of calcineurin activity causes chitin and chitosan accumulation and severe budding defects, whereas suppressor mutations restore largely normal growth and cytokinesis in the absence of calcineurin. These findings reveal the calcineurin signaling cascade controls a conserved cytokinesis machinery at the mitotic exit network during thermal stress.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Although the synthesis and activity of DnaA are highly regulated, the mechanisms of regulation vary between organisms. We found that production of DnaA in Bacillus subtilis is regulated by an antisense RNA that overlaps with the 5 untranslated region upstream of the dnaA open reading frame. We initially observed this RNA in in vitro transcription experiments and found that its production was inhibited by DnaA. This RNA, now called ArrA for antisense RNA repressor of dnaA, is made in vivo. We identified the arrA promoter and made a mutation that greatly reduced (or eliminated) production of ArrA RNA in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, this arrA promoter mutation caused an increase in the amount of mRNA and protein from dnaA and dnaN, indicating that arrA expression normally inhibits expression of the dnaA-dnaN operon. The arrA mutation also caused a delay in sporulation that was alleviated by loss of sda, a sporulation-inhibitory gene that is directly activated by DnaA. arrA appears to be conserved in some members of the Bacillus genus, indicating that arrA has evolved in at least some endospore-forming bacteria to modulate production of DnaA and enable timely and robust sporulation.

The spatial organization of cell surface proteins is central to these processes. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling have advanced studies of surface protein associations, but the spatial organization of the complete surface proteome remains uncharted. In this study, we systematically mapped the surface proteome of human T-lymphocytes and B-lymphoblasts using proximity labeling of 85 antigens, identified from over 100 antibodies tested for binding to surface-exposed proteins. These experiments were coupled with an optimized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry workflow to generate a robust dataset. Unsupervised clustering of the resulting interactome revealed functional modules, including well-characterized complexes such as the T-cell receptor and HLA class I/II, alongside novel clusters. Notably, we identified mitochondrial proteins localized to the surface, including the transcription factor TFAM, suggesting previously unappreciated roles for mitochondrial proteins at the plasma membrane. A high-accuracy machine learning classifier predicted over 6,000 surface protein associations, highlighting functional associations such as IL10RBs role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling. Spatial modeling of the surface proteome provided insights into protein dispersion patterns, distinguishing widely distributed proteins, such as CD45, from localized antigens, such as CD226 pointing to active mechanisms of regulating surface organization.

While recent advances in protein generative models, which learn probability distributions over amino acids conditioned on structural or evolutionary sequence contexts, have shown impressive performance in predicting various protein properties without task-specific training, their strong unsupervised prediction ability does not extend to all protein functions. In particular, their potential to improve protein stability prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we present SPURS, a novel deep learning framework that adapts and integrates two general-purpose protein generative models-a protein language model (ESM) and an inverse folding model (ProteinMPNN)-into an effective stability predictor. SPURS employs a lightweight neural network module to rewire per-residue structure representations learned by ProteinMPNN into the attention layers of ESM, thereby informing and enhancing ESMs sequence representation learning. This rewiring strategy enables SPURS to harness evolutionary patterns from both sequence and structure data, where the sequence like-lihood distribution learned by ESM is conditioned on structure priors encoded by ProteinMPNN to predict mutation effects. We steer this integrated framework to a stability prediction model through supervised training on a recently released mega-scale thermostability dataset. Evaluations across 12 benchmark datasets showed that SPURS delivers accurate, rapid, scalable, and generalizable stability predictions, consistently outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SPURS demonstrates remarkable versatility in protein stability and function analyses: when combined with a protein language model, it accurately identifies protein functional sites in an unsupervised manner. Additionally, it enhances current low-N protein fitness prediction models by serving as a stability prior model to improve accuracy. These results highlight SPURS as a powerful tool to advance current protein stability prediction and machine learning-guided protein engineering workflows.

MULTI-ATAC provides high accuracy in sample classification and doublet detection while eliminating batch effects associated with variable nucleus-to-Tn5 ratio. We illustrate the power of MULTI-ATAC by performing a 96-plex multiomic drug assay targeting epigenetic remodelers in a model of primary immune cell activation, uncovering tens of thousands of drug-responsive chromatin regions, cell-type specific effects, and potent differences between matched inhibitors and degraders. MULTI-ATAC therefore enables batch-free and scalable scATAC-seq workflows, providing deeper insights into complex biological processes and potential therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells; AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A, allowing RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision.

To address this, we present FAMPNN (Full-Atom MPNN), a sequence design method that explicitly models both sequence identity and sidechain conformation for each residue, where the per-token distribution of a residues discrete amino acid identity and its continuous sidechain conformation are learned with a combined categorical cross-entropy and diffusion loss objective.

Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups.

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes.

However, how NR5A2 differentially regulates transcriptional networks at distinct developmental stages remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the dynamics of chromatin binding profiles of NR5A2 from the 2-cell to morula stage, which corresponds to the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition. Our NR5A2 CUT&Tag analysis identifies lineage-determining factor KLF and GATA families as co-regulators for NR5A2 in mouse embryos. We find that KLF5 cooperates with NR5A2 to enhance H3K27ac deposition, and NR5A2 predominantly promotes chromatin accessibility. NR5A2 regulates Xist expression either directly or indirectly through its role in up-regulating GATA factor expression. In vitro assays reveal that NR5A2 co-binds to nucleosomes with KLF5 and GATA6, suggesting that these pioneer transcription factors can simultaneously bind to the chromatin. Our findings highlight the role of NR5A2 in ensuring robust gene activation during pre-implantation development through feed-forward regulatory loops with lineage-determining transcription factors.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

In this work, we compare and evaluate the annotation performance of the GPT-4 model against traditional methods on nine randomly selected public single-cell RNA seq datasets from cellxgene, covering diverse tissue types. Our evaluation highlights the complexity of annotating cell types in single-cell data, revealing key differences between automated and manual approaches.

We further introduce an automated approach to incorporate literature search using a RAG approach which enhances and outperforms GPT-4 cell type annotation when compared to traditional methods. We also introduce metrics based on taxonomic distance in the ontology tree to evaluate the granularity of the cell type annotations.

This was achieved by electroporation of strains stably expressing a codon-optimized Cas9 with two separate DNA molecules, one encoding a selectable marker flanked by short homology arms and a second encoding a sgRNA under the control of the U6 snRNA promoter. However, the efficiency of desired homology-dependent repair relative to undesired non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) events can be low and variable. Here, we describe methods and strains enabling extremely efficient ([~]99%) homology-dependent genome editing in C. neoformans. This high-efficiency method requires two manipulations. First, we placed the sgRNA-expressing segment into the marker-containing DNA flanked by targeting homology; thus, only a single DNA molecule is introduced into cells. Second, we used a strain mutant for the non-homologous end-joining factor Ku80 (encoded by YKU80). We also report the engineering of a yku80::amdS mutant strain harboring an insertion mutation that can be removed scarlessly via recombination between direct repeats. This enables the functional restoration of YKU80 after homology- dependent genome editing via selection against the amdS marker using fluoroacetamide. This approach minimizes documented drawbacks of using Ku-defective strains in downstream experiments. Finally, we describe a plasmid series that enables rapid cloning of sgRNA-marker constructs for genomic manipulation of C. neoformans, including gene deletion and C-terminal tagging. These methods, strains, and plasmids accelerate the genomic manipulation of C. neoformans.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

How different immune cell types engage PRR- and guard protein-dependent defenses in response to infection is poorly understood. Here, we show that macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) respond in distinct ways to bacterial virulence activities. In macrophages, the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila deploys its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins that facilitate its robust intracellular replication. In contrast, T4SS activity triggers rapid DC death that potently restricts Legionella replication within this cell type. Intriguingly, we found that infected DCs exhibit considerable heterogeneity at the single cell level. Initially, a subset of DCs activate caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and release IL-1{beta} early during infection. At later timepoints, a separate DC population undergoes apoptosis driven by T4SS effectors that block host protein synthesis, thereby depleting the levels of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP. Together, pyroptosis and effector-triggered apoptosis robustly restrict Legionella replication in DCs. Collectively, our work suggests a model where Mcl-1 and cFLIP guard host translation in DCs, and that macrophages and DCs distinctly employ innate immune sensors and guard proteins to mount divergent responses to Legionella infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Accurately identifying regions that are spatially coherent in both gene expression and physical tissue structures is an emerging topic, but challenging due to the lack of ground truth labels which renders complicating validation of clustering consistency and reproducibility. This highlights a need for a computational evaluation framework to rigorously and unbiasedly assess clustering performance.

ResultsTo address this gap, we propose STEAM (Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric), a user-friendly computational pipeline designed to evaluate the consistency and reliability of clustering results by leveraging machine learning classification and prediction methods, with the goal of maintaining the spatial proximity and gene expression patterns within clusters. We benchmarked STEAM on various public datasets, spanning multi-cell to single-cell resolution, as well as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. The results highlighted its robustness and generalizability through comprehensive statistical evaluation metrics, such as Kappa score, F1 score, accuracy, and adjusted rand index. Notably, STEAM supports multi-sample training, enabling cross-replicate clustering consistency assessment. Moreover, STEAM provides practical guidance by comparing clustering results across multiple approaches; here, we evaluated four different methods, including spatial-aware and spatial-ignorant approaches. In summary, we believe that STEAM provides researchers a promising tool for evaluating clustering robustness and benchmarking clustering performance for spatial omics data, offering valuable insights to drive reproducible discoveries in spatial biology.

A key debate in the field centers on whether compositional methods are necessary for DA analysis, which is challenging to answer due to the lack of ground truth data. To address this gap, we created the Bioconductor data package MicrobiomeBenchmarkData, featuring three microbiome datasets with established biological ground truths: 1) diverse oral microbiomes from supragingival and subgingival plaques, expected to favor aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, respectively, 2) low-diversity microbiomes from healthy vaginas and bacterial vaginosis, conditions that have been well-characterized through cell culture and microscopy, and 3) a spike-in dataset with constant, known absolute abundances of three bacteria. We benchmarked 17 DA approaches and demonstrated that compositional DA methods are not beneficial but rather lack sensitivity, show increased variability in constant-abundance spike-ins, and, most surprisingly, more frequently produce paradoxical results with DA in the wrong direction for the low-diversity microbiome. Conversely, commonly used methods in microbiome literature, such as LEfSe, the Wilcoxon test, and RNA-seq-derived methods, performed best. We conclude that researchers continue using widely adopted non-parametric or RNA-seq DA methods and that further development of compositional methods includes benchmarking against datasets with known biological ground truth.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

The manual quantification of the FI from 2D microscopy images is tedious and biased, thus several automated methods have been developed. However, they still face challenges such as efficient nucleus segmentation and classification of fused and isolated myoblast nuclei. Here, we developed a novel workflow entirely based on AI for fully automated and unbiased quantification of the FI.

ResultsUsing current methods, we show that myoblast nuclei located above or below myotubes can significantly corrupt accurate FI computation. To circumvent this issue, we developed MyoFuse which enables an accurate and high-throughput segmentation and classification of myonuclei. It comprises a nuclei segmentation step using Cellpose, followed by a classification network trained with Svetlana. MyoFuse demonstrated strong accuracy when tested against manual annotation in mouse C2C12 and human primary myotubes. The trained classifier is able to differentiate myotube nuclei from myoblast nuclei based on myotube cytoplasm staining only. Experimental comparisons also highlighted that the previously developed methods lead to a significant overestimation of the FI.

ConclusionIn summary, we underscore the lack of accuracy of traditional methods for automated FI quantification. MyoFuse enables a direct and accurate segmentation of nuclei even in nuclei clusters frequently observed in myotubes. This workflow thus offers a new and more reliable method to evaluate the FI. It also limits the selection bias by processing large images.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Additionally, we examined the impact of these methods on divergence time estimation using a dataset that includes newly vetted fossil calibrations for the Avian Tree of Life. Our findings highlight that recently developed fast tree search approaches offer a reasonable compromise between computational efficiency and phylogenetic accuracy, facilitating inference of macrophylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Here we performed machine learning-augmented analysis of published single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and identified macaque imGCs with transcriptome-wide immature neuronal characteristics. Our cross-species comparisons among humans, monkeys, pigs, and mice showed few shared (such as DPYSL5), but mostly species-specific gene expression in imGCs that converged onto common biological processes regulating neuronal development. We further identified human-specific transcriptomic features of imGCs and demonstrated functional roles of human imGC-enriched expression of a family of proton-transporting vacuolar-type ATPase subtypes in development of imGCs derived from human pluripotent stem cells. Our study reveals divergent gene expression patterns but convergent biological processes in the molecular characteristics of imGCs across species, highlighting the importance of conducting independent molecular and functional analyses for adult neurogenesis in different species.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

This may result from long-term coevolution between viruses and bats, that have led to host adaptations contributing to an effective balance between strong antiviral responses with innate immune tolerance. To better understand these virus-host interactions, we combined comparative transcriptomics, phylogenomics and functional assays to characterize the evolution of bat innate immune antiviral factors. First, we stimulated the type I interferon immune pathway in Myotis yumanensis primary cells and identified guanylate-binding protein 5 (GBP5) as the most differentially expressed interferon-stimulated gene (ISG). Phylogenomic analyses showed that bat GBP5 has been under strong episodic positive selection, with numerous rapidly evolving sites and species-specific gene duplications, suggesting past evolutionary arms races. Functional tests on GBP5 orthologs from ten bat species covering the >60 million years of Chiroptera evolution revealed species- and virus-specific restrictions against RNA viruses (retrovirus HIV, and rhabdoviruses European bat lyssavirus and VSV), which are typical signatures of adaptations to past viral epidemics. Interestingly, we also observed a lineage-specific loss of the GBP5 prenylation motif in the common ancestor of Pipistrellus and Eptesicus bats, associated with different GBP5 subcellular localization and loss of antiviral functions. Resurrection of the ancestral prenylation motif in Eptesicus fuscus GBP5 rescued its subcellular localization, but not the complete antiviral activities, suggesting that additional determinants are necessary for the antiviral restriction. Altogether, our results highlight adaptations that contribute to bat specific immunity and provide insights into the functional evolution of antiviral effector GBP5.

Key FindingsO_LIGBP5 is the most differentially expressed gene upon type I interferon stimulation of Myotis yumanensis primary cells.

Genomic profiles from 853,005 cells mapped to 12 pancreatic cell types, including multiple exocrine sub-types. Beta, acinar, and other cell types, and related cellular niches, had altered abundance and gene activity in T1D progression, including distinct pathways altered in AAB+ compared to T1D. We identified epigenomic drivers of gene activity in T1D and AAB+ which, combined with genetic association, revealed causal pathways of T1D risk including antigen presentation in beta cells. Finally, single cell and spatial profiles together revealed widespread changes in cell-cell signaling in T1D including signals affecting beta cell regulation. Overall, these results revealed drivers of T1D progression in the pancreas, which form the basis for therapeutic targets for disease prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about  self and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1s function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Here we present ActSeek - a computer vision-inspired fast program - that searches structural databases for proteins with active sites similar to the seed protein. ActSeek is implemented to mine proteins with desired active site environments from the Alphafold database. The potential of ActSeek to find innovative solutions to the worlds most pressing challenges is demonstrated by finding enzymes that may be used to produce biodegradable plastics or degrade plastics, as well as potential off-targets for common drug molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Likely a consequence of the known instability of RNA relative to DNA, this has effectively nullified the use of herbaria for transcriptomics. Here, we challenge the assumption that herbaria cannot be used for transcriptomics by assembling transcriptomes from RNA extracted from herbarium specimens. Through systematic comparison of transcriptomes from fresh-collected, silica-dried, and archival specimens, we demonstrate the suitability of herbarium-derived RNA for transcriptomics. The practical applicability of archival mRNA was further illustrated by the functional validation of a plant immune receptor synthesized from a specimen collected in 1956. These results contradict the community consensus regarding archival RNA and open the door to subsequent transcriptomic explorations in rare and extinct species. Our findings highlight the importance of preserving and utilizing the diversity embedded within herbarium collections.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3s tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues. On a test set of peptides with ncAAs, our approach outperforms HighFold2 on 13/17 cases, with an average C RMSD of 1.877[A] and an average all-atom RMSD of 3.361[A]. Our results show that the cyclic offset encoding shown for AlphaFold2 generalizes to AlphaFold3-based models and can be extended to incorporate ncAAs, showing potential in the design of novel cyclic peptides with ncAAs for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740175714551
