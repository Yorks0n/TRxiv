This study aimed to analyse any possible connection between these factors.

MethodsThe top performing 18 nations from 2012, 2016 and 2020 Olympics (after Russia and Ukraine were excluded) had their relative Gold medals, total medals and medal points (Gold =3, Silver=2, Bronze=1) for Paris 2024 analysed using a backward stepwise linear regression model. Initial input factors included previous medal tallies, home city advantage, time zone effects, national excess deaths 2020-2023, average GDP growth 2020-2023 and number of country signatories to the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), with factors >P=0.10 removed sequentially.

ResultsTotal medals were best predicted by previous total medals (t=21.0, P<0.001) and home city advantage (t=4.1, P<0.001). Gold medals were best predicted by previous Gold medals (t=10.3, P<0.001), low national excess deaths (t=-3.2, P<0.007) and low signatories to the GBD (t=-2.2, P<0.05). Medal points were best predicted by previous medal points (t=18.1, P<0.001), home city advantage (t=3.2, P<0.007) and low national excess deaths (t=-1.8, P<0.09).

DiscussionThe Western Pacific countries with a COVID-cautious national perspective (Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea) tended to win more Gold medals than expected in Paris, compared to countries with a COVID-stoical national perspective (e.g. Great Britain, United States) which won fewer Golds than expected. This suggests that a COVID-cautious mentality may have contributed to better performance than a COVID-stoical approach. It is unclear whether any mechanism was physiological (less infectious disease impact before or during the Olympics) or psychological. If this effect existed for Golds, it did not appear to have any effect on Silver and Bronze medals.

The five countries with lower than 6% Excess mortality over the time period 2020-2023 all won more Gold medals than expected in Paris. The relationship between Excess mortality and change in Gold medals was negative and moderately strong. In the linear regression for prediction of Gold medals in Paris, Excess mortality was a highly significant predictor (t=-3.2, P<0.007). The exact mechanism of this relationship (physiological via reduced infection or psychological or via unassessed confounders) is unclear, but it can be confidently stated that in the countries which had tighter pandemic restrictions in 2020-21 and lower excess mortality, athletes have not suffered any ""immunity debt"" relative to the rest of the world.","NA","medrxiv",1724882893026

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients' low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n<100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases' restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the 'healthy volunteer' selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1724882893026

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in 1,990 proteins. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abun-dance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse. These results demonstrate the contribution of alternate translation to diversifying mammalian proteomes, and its association with protein stability, tissue-specific proteomes, and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

To understand if recent H5N1 viruses are changing their receptor use, we screened recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) from historical and recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses for binding to distinct glycans bearing terminal sialic acids. We found that H5 from A/Texas/37/2024, an isolate from the dairy cow outbreak, has increased binding breadth to glycans bearing terminal 2,3 sialic acids, the avian receptor, compared to historical and recent 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses. We did not observe any binding to 2,6 sialic acids, the receptor used by human seasonal influenza viruses. We identified a single mutation outside of the receptor binding site, T199I, was responsible for increased binding breadth, as it increased receptor binding site flexibility. Together, these data show recent H5N1 viruses are evolving increased receptor binding breadth which could impact the host range and cell types infected with H5N1.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Addressing this gap, we generated extensive RNA-sequencing data for multiple organs across 22 representative species over the fern phylogeny, assembling high-quality transcriptomes. These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have chartered since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

While major signalling pathways critical for this control have been identified, how they achieve such a tight balance in cell type composition remains unclear. Here, we uncover dynamic expression of Hes1, a direct NOTCH target, in intestinal stem and progenitor cells, and investigate its role in vivo and in vitro. A knock-in reporter reveals distinct, cell-specific period lengths in Hes1 oscillations that form a gradient along the crypt-villus axis. Whereas secretory precursors oscillate at low periods, absorptive precursors oscillate at higher periods before transitioning to a differentiated state. To test the function of different oscillation periods, we innovated a microfluidic system that modulates Hes1 oscillations in organoids. We find that varying the oscillation period modulates secretory cell differentiation: While 90-min oscillations promote Paneth cells, 130-min oscillations increase formation of other secretory subtypes. Moreover, low-period oscillations support stemness and a proliferative state. Our study provides the first clear evidence that information for tissue homeostasis in the intestine is encoded in the temporal dynamics of signalling components.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Recent developments of computer vision tools enable the automatic quantification of behaviours, supplementing or even replacing manual annotations. However, widespread adoption of these methods is still limited, due to the lack of annotated training datasets and domain-specific knowledge required to optimize these models for animal research. Here, we present YOLO-Behaviour, a flexible framework for identifying visually distinct behaviours from video recordings. The framework is robust, easy to implement, and requires minimal manual annotations as training data. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework with case studies for event-wise detection in house sparrow nestling provisioning, Siberian jay feeding, human eating behaviours, and frame-wise detections of various behaviours in pigeons, zebras, and giraffes. Our results show that the framework reliably detects behaviours accurately, and retrieve comparable accuracy metrics to manual annotation. However, metrics extracted for event-wise detection were less correlated with manual annotation, and potential reasons for the discrepancy between manual annotation and automatic detection are discussed. To mitigate this problem, the framework can be used as a hybrid approach of first detecting events using the pipeline and then manually confirming the detections, saving annotation time. We provide detailed documentation and guidelines on how to implement the YOLO-Behaviour framework, for researchers to readily train and deploy new models on their own study systems. We anticipate the framework can be another step towards lowering the barrier of entry for applying computer vision methods in animal behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

T cells, in particular, leverage their unique T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. TCR activation is then relayed via linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a TCR-proximal disordered adapter protein, which organizes protein partners and mediates the propagation of signals down diverse pathways including NFAT and AP-1. Here, we studied how balanced downstream pathway activation is encoded in the amino acid sequence of LAT. To comprehensively profile the sequence-function relationship of LAT, we developed a pooled, single-cell, high-content screening approach in which a large series of mutants in the LAT protein were analyzed to characterize their effects on T cell activation. Measuring epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cell surface protein dynamics of single cells harboring distinct LAT mutants, we found functional regions spanning over 40% of the LAT amino acid sequence. Conserved sequence motifs for protein interactions along with charge distribution are critical sequence features, and contribute to interpretation of human genetic variation in LAT. While mutant defect severity spans from moderate to complete loss of function, nearly all defective mutants, irrespective of their position in LAT, confer balanced defects across all downstream pathways. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we performed proximal protein labeling which demonstrated that disruption of LAT interaction with a single partner protein indirectly disrupts other partner interactions, likely through the dual roles of these proteins as effectors of downstream pathways and bridging factors between LAT molecules. Overall, we report widely distributed functional regions throughout a disordered adapter and a precise physical organization of LAT and interacting molecules which constrains signaling outputs. More broadly, we describe an approach for interrogating sequence-function relationships for proteins with complex activities across regulatory layers of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Arabidopsis lyrata appears to be the most polyploidy-rich species-complex in the Arabidopsis genus, with multiple origins of autotetraploidy. This is revealed by genomic data from over 400 samples across Eurasia. We found over 30 previously undescribed autotetraploid populations in Siberia with a minimum of two separate origins, independent of those previously reported in Central Europe. The establishment of Siberian tetraploids is mediated by meiotic adaptation at the same genes as in European tetraploid A. lyrataand Arabidopsis arenosa, despite high divergence and geographical separation. Haplotype analysis based on synthetic long-read assemblies supports the long-range introgression of adaptive alleles from the tetraploid interspecific pool of European A. lyrata and A. arenosa to tetraploid Siberian A. lyrata. Once evolved, adaptations to polyploidy promote the establishment of new polyploid lineages through adaptive inter- and intraspecific introgression.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

A central question is how individual subunits within these complexes can evolve novel functions while maintaining the integrity of the original assembly. Here, we explore this question by tracing the evolutionary trajectory of the plant exocyst, an octameric complex essential for exocytosis in eukaryotes. Remarkably, the Exo70 subunit underwent dramatic expansion and functional divergence in plants. We demonstrate that electrostatic alterations in the N-terminal region of the Exo70 subunit precipitated its dissociation from the exocyst complex. This release mitigated paralog interference, thereby facilitating the subunits extensive functional co-option. Our findings reveal a nuanced mechanism by which a protein subunit, ancestrally constrained within a multimeric complex, can escape those constraints and evolve novel functions, shedding light on the molecular underpinnings of cellular innovation.

Here, we determine the detailed 3D architecture of corpuscular components and reveal their contribution to touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for rapid adaptation and frequency tuning. Instead, these properties arise from the inner core, composed of gap junction-coupled lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs) surrounding the afferent terminal. By acting as additional touch sensing structures, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast-inactivating ion channels. We propose a model in which Pacinian corpuscle function is mediated by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.

Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics.

A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, i.e. a hypoxic niche, a leading-edge niche, and a perivascular niche, in which malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, by analysis of single cell transcriptomic data of human GBM and transgenic mouse models of GBM, we unexpectedly identified pericytes, mural cells intimately associated with the endothelium, as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Exclusive signaling axes emanating from pericytes were received by endothelial cells, malignant cells, astrocytes, and immune cells. Depletion of pericytes through genetic engineering in several different transgenic and orthotopic mouse models of GBM demonstrated accelerated tumor progression, a disrupted blood brain-barrier, and premature death of pericyte poor mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that pericyte deficiency altered the cellular composition of GBM, remodeled the endothelium, and impacted on the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, endothelial cells deprived of pericyte association altered their signaling programs, which in turn attracted perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immunesuppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages expressed Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), which reinforced activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring an extreme mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1 within hypoxic regions. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of isolated, MET-expressing GBM cells corroborated their superior tumor-initiating capability and invasive phenotype. In patients, low expression of a pericyte core gene signature was reduced in recurrent GBM, compared to primary tumors. Consistently, gene signatures for transcriptional programs of Fosl1+Met+ GBM cells were indicative of poor survival in human tumors, and spatial transcriptomics corroborated their superior invasive capacity. Taken together, we infer that the pericyte represents a critical modulator of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment; our findings thus highlight the importance of pericyte preservation in the face of current and future GBM therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

However, fundamental questions about the causes and consequences of L1 activity in cancer genomes remain unresolved, primarily due to the limitations of short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we employ multiplatform sequencing, with an emphasis on long reads, to analyse a fine selection of 10 tumours exhibiting high rates of somatic retrotransposition, encompassing over 6000 events. The analysis of L1 locus-specific single-nucleotide variants reveals a novel panorama of L1 loci activity. Furthermore, examination of the internal structure of somatic L1s uncovers the mechanisms behind their inactivation. A hidden landscape of chromosomal aberrations emerges in the light of long reads, where reciprocal translocations mediated by L1 insertion represent frequent events. Resolution of L1 bridges configuration elucidates the mechanisms of their formation, where typically two independent, but synchronous, somatic L1 insertions drive the reciprocal exchange between non-homologous chromosomes. Timing analyses indicate that L1 retrotransposition is an early driver of chromosomal instability, active before the first whole-genome doubling event. Overall, these findings highlight L1 activity as a more significant contributor to tumour genome plasticity than previously recognized, extending its impact beyond simple insertional mutagenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

The regulatory logic of differentiation includes factors specific to one or multiple cell types, functioning in a combinatorial fashion. Classic approaches of GRN discovery used perturbational data to elucidate TF-TG links, but are laborious and not scalable across the tree of life. Single cell transcriptomics has emerged as a revolutionary approach to study gene expression with cell type resolution, but incorporating perturbational data is challenging. Planarians, with their pluripotent neoblast stem cells continuously giving rise to all cell types, offer an ideal model to attempt this integration. Despite extensive single cell transcriptomic studies, the transcriptional and chromatin regulation at the cell type level remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation by obtaining an organism-level integration of single cell transcriptomics and single cell accessibility data. We identify specific open chromatin profiles for major differentiated cell types and analyse their transcriptomic landscape, revealing distinct gene modules expressed in individual types and combinations of them. Integrated analysis unveils gene networks reflecting known TF interactions in each type and identifies TFs potentially driving differentiation across multiple cell types. To validate our predictions, we combined TF knockdown RNAi experiments with single cell transcriptomics. We focus on hnf4, a TF known to be expressed in gut phagocytes, and confirm its influence on other types, including parenchymal cells. Our results demonstrate high overlap between predicted targets and experimentally-validated differentially-regulated genes.

Despite numerous methods proposed in recent years, a systematic understanding of the best solution is still lacking. Results: Here, we systematically evaluate 47 highly variable gene (HVG) selection methods, consisting of 21 baseline methods developed based on different data transformations and mean-variance adjustment techniques and 26 hybrid methods developed based on mixtures of baseline methods. Across 19 diverse benchmark datasets, 18 objective evaluation criteria per method, and 5,358 analysis settings, we observe that no single baseline method consistently outperforms the others across all datasets and criteria. However, hybrid methods as a group robustly outperform individual baseline methods.

As hypothesized, patients with IFC lesions showed significantly fewer perceptual changes compared to patients without IFC lesions (IFC 44.9 {+/-} 46.3 s, non-IFC 28.2 {+/-} 37.1 s, T(182.9) = 3.1, p = 2.2 x 10-3). Importantly, this effect remained significant when controlling for age, sex, stroke severity and lesion volume (T(5.97) = -2.9, p =0.026). Our results support the notion that the IFC is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguities, suggesting an active role of frontal cortex in shaping conscious visual experience.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Multiple ribosome-hibernation factors have been identified in all domains of life, but due to their structural diversity and the lack of a common inactivation mechanism, it is currently unknown how many different hibernation factors exist. Here, we show that the YqjD/ElaB/YgaM paralogs, initially discovered as membrane-bound ribosome binding proteins in E. coli, constitute an abundant class of ribosome-hibernating proteins, which are conserved across all proteobacteria and some other bacterial phyla. Our data demonstrate that they inhibit in vitro protein synthesis by interacting with the 50S ribosomal subunit. In vivo cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry reveals their specific interactions with proteins surrounding the ribosomal tunnel exit and even their penetration into the ribosomal tunnel. Thus, YqjD/ElaB/YgaM inhibit translation by blocking the ribosomal tunnel and thus mimic the activity of antimicrobial peptides and macrolide antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

They are involved in the biosynthesis of primary and specialized metabolites, including salicylic acid (SA), a key defense phytohormone synthesized via the conserved chorismate biosynthetic pathway. However, the identity of the signal(s) that ultimately triggers SA induction in chloroplasts upon perception of a biotic threat has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence of a functional link between chloroplast-derived reactive oxygen species (cROS) and SA production. We observe that inhibiting ROS bursts generated from photosystem II during plant immune activation completely abrogates the induction of SA synthesis in response to immunity-inducing signals, without affecting SA-independent immune responses. Indeed, time course analyses show that the induction of SA marker genes parallels that of cROS production during an immune response. Consistent with this, preventing cROS induction is sufficient to nullify the immune protection normally conferred by activating immunity prior to an infection. Analyses of transcriptomes and photosynthetic efficiency show that two conserved effectors from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, HopM1 and AvrE1, redundantly disrupt photosynthesis and cROS bursts. These effects reduce SA accumulation and are mediated via the impact of HopM1 and AvrE1 in inducting host abscisic acid signaling. Our results suggest that a change in chloroplastic redox homeostasis induced by biotic stressors acts as an initiator of plant immunity through the production of SA, and that this response is targeted by conserved pathogen effector proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

We investigated how acute enhancer-driven activation affects neighboring non-target genes within the same TAD. Using single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), we tracked the transcription of TFF1 (enhancer-targeted) and TFF3 (non-targeted) during estrogen stimulation. We observed mutually exclusive expression patterns: TFF1 expression peaked at 1 hour, while TFF3 reached its peak at 3 hours, after TFF1s activation had diminished. Chromatin looping data indicated that the enhancer loops with TFF1 but not TFF3, suggesting that TFF3 upregulation is not due to direct enhancer-promoter interactions. CRISPR deletion of the TFF1enhancer and 1,6-hexanediol (HD) exposure revealed that the TFF1 enhancer:promoter undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), which sequesters the transcriptional machinery and inhibits TFF3 expression. As estrogen signaling wanes or LLPS is disrupted, TFF1 expression declines while TFF3 expression increases. Our findings reveal that enhancer-driven activation can indirectly influence neighboring genes, highlighting a dynamic shift in gene expression as signaling progresses.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Influenzaviruses have been studied mainly in birds but minor in bats. It is unknown whether Chiroptera are reservoirs of influenza viruses. However, circulation in bats showed molecular divergence from H17N10 (Guatemala) and H18N11 (Peru), and they were designated as new subtypes. The study aimed to characterize the influenza A virus detected in the fishing bat Noctilio albiventris. A surveillance study of pathogens of public health interest was carried out; rectal samples were taken from four fishing bats (N. albiventris) captured in Talaigua Nuevo, Bolivar, Colombia. The samples were sequenced by NGS using DNBseq (MGI-G50(R)) and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Eight viral contigs associated with the Orthomyxoviridae family were obtained. The identified segments showed around 90% similarity with H18N11, except for the neuraminidase (N). The phylogenetic analysis of the N protein showed the appearance of a basal branch to the N11 subtype, and the molecular clock indicates that it does not share a recent common ancestor. 3D modeling indicates that the N protein of N. albiventris presents three mutations (K363R, T242K, and I139V) near the hypothetical active site of the protein. These mutations potentially increase the interaction with the HLA-DR of bats, which could have significant implications for the viruss behavior.

Over the last two decades, ART-R has spread widely across Southeast Asia, compromising public health strategies and hindering elimination efforts. As of 2024, ART-R has now emerged in East Africa, with the potential to dramatically increase human mortality in the region. Mitigating the spread of ART-R requires detailed genomic surveillance of point mutations in the kelch13 gene, the primary determinant of resistance to artemisinin derivatives. Although extensive surveillance data on these markers is available, it is distributed across many literature studies and open databases. In this literature review, we aggregate publicly available spatiotemporal data for 112,933 P. falciparum samples between 1980 - 2023 into a single resource, providing the most comprehensive overview of kelch13 markers to date. By synthesising insights from these samples over a global scale, we outline the history and current status of kelch13 mutations associated with ART-R, with particular reference to their emergence in Southeast Asia and recent emergence in East and Northeast Africa. Concerningly, we find their recent increases in frequency in these areas of Africa are comparable to those observed in Southeast Asia 10-15 years ago. We review several factors that may influence the spread of ART-R going forwards, such as fitness costs, treatment strategies, and local epidemiological dynamics, before articulating possible scenarios on how resistance may spread in Africa in coming years. In summary, this review provides a unified, comprehensive account of how the situation of ART-R has unfolded globally so far, highlighting insights both for researchers in the field and public health bodies which aim to reduce its negative effects. More broadly, we highlight the critical role genomic surveillance has had, and will continue to have in combating the spread of ART-R.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Four AFP types have convergently evolved in several fish lineages. AFPs inhibit ice crystal growth and lower cellular freezing point. In lineages with AFPs, species inhabiting colder environments may possess more AFP copies. Elucidating how differences in AFP copy number evolve is challenging due to the genes tandem array structure and consequently poor resolution of these repetitive regions. Here we explore the evolution of type III AFPs (AFP III) in the globally distributed suborder Zoarcoidei, leveraging six new long-read genome assemblies. Zoarcoidei has fewer genomic resources relative to other polar fish clades while it is one of the few groups of fishes adapted to both the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Combining these new assemblies with additional long-read genomes available for Zoarcoidei, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic test of AFP III evolution and modeled the effects of thermal habitat and depth on AFP III gene family evolution. We confirm a single origin of AFP III via neofunctionalization of the enzyme sialic acid synthase B and show that AFP gains and losses were not only correlated with temperature, but also with depth, which reduces freezing point via pressure. Associations between the environment and AFP III copy number were driven by duplications of paralogs that were translocated out of the ancestral locus at which Zoarcoidei AFP arose. Our results reveal novel environmental effects on AFP evolution and demonstrate the value of high-quality genomic resources for studying how structural genomic variation shapes convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

We engineered FoF1 to form multiple peripheral stalks, each bound to a proton-conducting a-subunit.

Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations.

Analyses of this model revealed that the competitive binding of two types of client proteins is required for the PIP formation. The PIP only formed when CaMKII had high valency and a short linker length. Such CaMKII proteins exhibited a low surface tension, a modular structure, and slow diffusion. These properties are consistent with the functions required by CaMKII to store information at the synaptic level.

However, the identities of RNAs whose localization is regulated by a specific RBP as well as the impacts of that RNA localization on cell function have generally remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the RBP HNRNPA2B1 acts to keep specific RNAs out of neuronal projections. Using subcellular fractionation, high-throughput sequencing, and single molecule RNA FISH, we find that hundreds of RNAs demonstrate markedly increased abundance in neurites in HNRNPA2B1 knockout cells. These RNAs often encode motor proteins and are enriched for known HNRNPA2B1 binding sites and motifs in their 3' UTRs. The speed and processivity of microtubule-based transport is impaired in these cells, specifically in their neurites. HNRNPA2B1 point mutations that increase its cytoplasmic abundance relative to wildtype lead to stronger suppression of RNA mislocalization defects than seen with wildtype HNRNPA2B1. We further find that the subcellular localizations of HNRNPA2B1 target RNAs are sensitive to perturbations of RNA decay machinery, suggesting that it is HNRNPA2B1's known role in regulating RNA stability that may explain these observations. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a negative regulator of neurite RNA abundance and link the subcellular activities of motor proteins with the subcellular abundance of the RNAs that encode them.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively.

Unfortunately, this technique has remained largely inaccessible at 7T, due to prohibitive cross-modal interference effects and physical constraints. Here, we developed a first-of-its-kind EEG-fMRI acquisition framework on a clinical 7T system combining key improvements from previous works: compact EEG transmission chain to reduce artifact incidence, reference sensors for artifact correction, and adapted leads for compatibility with a dense radiofrequency receive-array allowing state-of-the-art fMRI sensitivity and acceleration. Two implementations were tested: one using an EEG cap adapted in-house, and another using a recently-designed prototype from an industrial manufacturer, intended to be further developed into a commercial product accessible to the broader community. A comprehensive evaluation in humans showed that simultaneous acquisitions, including with sub-millimeter fMRI resolution, could be conducted without detectable safety issues or major practical constraints. The EEG exerted relatively mild perturbations on fMRI quality (6-11% loss in temporal SNR), without measurably affecting the detection of resting-state networks and visual responses. The artifacts induced on EEG could be corrected to a degree where the spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics were comparable to outside recordings, and hallmark features such as resting-state alpha and eyes-closing alpha modulation could be clearly detected. Altogether, these findings indicate excellent prospects for neuroimaging applications, that can leverage the unique possibilities achievable at 7T.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

One such inhibitor, the gating-modifier peptide Protoxin-I derived from tarantula venom, blocks channel opening by shifting the activation voltage threshold to more depolarised potentials, but the structural basis for this inhibition has not previously been determined. Using monolayer graphene grids, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of full-length human apo-NaV1.8 and the Protoxin-I-bound complex at 3.1 Angstrom and 2.8 Angstrom resolution, respectively.

However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted two- fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a fast cell cycle restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mESCs globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the ""2i medium""). H3K27me3 levels in mESC increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of cell cycle length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome and cellular identity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect, that G1 shortening in differentiated cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.1K27M mutation. Our results indicate that G1 length is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscapes across diverse cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893026

Today, the A-allele occurs with an average frequency of 5% in Europe.

MethodsThis study comprised 251 ancient genomes from Europe spanning over 14,000 years. In these samples, the investigation focused on admixture informed analyses and selection scans of rs11209026-A and its haplotypes.

Findingsrs11209026-A was found at high frequencies in Anatolian Farmers (AF, 18%) where it was likely under weak positive selection. AF later introduced the allele into the ancient European gene-pool. Subsequent admixture caused its frequency to decrease and formed the current southwest-to-northeast allele frequency cline in Europe. The geographic distribution of rs11209026-A may influence the gradient in IBD incidence rates that are highest in northern and eastern Europe.

InterpretationGiven the dramatic changes from hunting and gathering to agriculture during the Neolithic, AF might have been exposed to selective pressures from a pro-inflammatory lifestyle and diet. Therefore, the protective A-allele may have increased survival by reducing intestinal inflammation and microbiome dysbiosis. The adaptively evolved function of the variant likely contributes to the high efficacy and low side-effects of modern IL-23 neutralization therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases. This study highlights how evolutionary informed research can provide promising targets for new therapeutic strategies.

GNAL encodes Golf, a heterotrimeric G-protein  subunit with a defined molecular function to increase the production of the second messenger cAMP. Golf is abundant in the striatum, and is the only stimulatory G-protein in many cell types of the striatum. Due to the defined molecular signaling pathway and expression pattern of Golf, the clear genetic link to dystonia makes GNAL an exciting target to understand the pathological mechanisms of not only this genetic dystonia, but also the larger idiopathic disease. To better understand GNAL-linked dystonia, we generated a novel genetic mouse model that allows us to conditionally knock out Gnal in a site and time-specific manner. In the current study we used genetic or AAV based approaches to express Cre to knockout striatal Gnal in our novel Gnal fl/fl model. We then performed motor behavioral testing and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of striatal spiny projection neurons to interrogate how loss of Gnal leads to dystonia. Mice with conditional striatal knockout of Gnal show hindlimb clasping, other dystonia-like postures, less motor coordination, slowness, and torticollis as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, striatal spiny projection neurons show increased excitability in Gnal knockout animals. These exciting data are the first to report uninduced, overt dystonia in a mouse model of GNAL-linked dystonia, and directly correlate these with changes in spiny projection neuron electrophysiological properties. Our results show that adult loss of Gnal in the striatum leads to the development of dystonia, through homeostatic, paradoxical increases in spiny projection neuron excitability, and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing this hyperexcitable phenotype may provide symptomatic relief for patients with disease.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Plankton research is often approached using either optical methods, especially for taxonomic purposes, or genomics, which excels at describing the biochemistry of microbial communities. This technological dichotomy hampers efforts to link the morpho-optical properties of each species with its genetic and biomolecular makeup, leading to fragmented information and limited reproducibility. Methods to simultaneously acquire multimodal, i.e. optical and genetic, information on planktonic organisms would provide a connection between organismal appearance and function, improve taxonomic prediction, and strengthen ecological analysis. Here we present Ukiyo-e-Seq, an approach to generate paired optical and transcriptomic data from individual eukaryotic plankton. We performed Ukiyo-e-Seq on 66 microscopic organisms from Coogee, NSW, Australia and assembled transcriptomic contigs using a merge-split strategy. While overall phylogenetic heterogeneity spanned hundreds of taxa, diversity in individual wells was low, enabling accurate classification of both microbial plankton and marine larvae. We then combined Ukiyo-e-Seq with AlphaFold 3, a protein language model, and could confidently infer (i) the joint structure and interactions of 34 photosynthesis proteins from a single Chaetoceros diatom, and (ii) the cellular and developmental functions of novel proteins highly expressed in one trout larva. In summary, Ukiyo-e-Seq is a precise tool to connect morphological and genetic information of eukaryotic plankton.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

A fundamental role of head direction cells is to provide input to MEC grid cells, which are thought to translate information about head direction into a metric code for spatial location. However, classic anatomical studies indicate that most thalamic HD projections pass indirectly to the MEC via the post- and para-subiculum, with only a small subset of ADN fibers terminating in the MEC. To further investigate the smaller and direct projection to the MEC, we use rabies-mediated retrograde tracing in mice to determine if this projection explicitly targets a subset of MEC neurons. Our findings reveal that ADN neurons specifically project onto MEC interneurons, with a preference for MEC VIP-expressing cells. Additionally, MEC VIP cells receive input from the hippocampus, the subicular complex, and the retrosplenial cortex - key centers for spatial memory - suggesting a specialized role for MEC VIP cells in spatial memory. Indeed, we find that MEC VIP cells exhibit increased c-Fos expression in a spatial memory task and show that chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons impairs task performance. Together, these data uncover a specific projection of head direction information onto MEC interneurons and confirm that MEC VIP-expressing cells are critical for spatial memory.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

While this green biochemical approach for producing high-value chemicals holds tremendous potential, the current in situ extraction methods, utilizing traditional solvents such as dodecane and perfluorinated chemicals, present separation challenges, unfavorable economics, and risk of cell toxicity. Here, we develop a low-cost solvent-free approach based on silanized silica particles to fill the technology gap. We determine the feasibility and specificity of three differently coated (C11, C16, C18) silica particles to extract nine terpenoid metabolites from C. reinhardtii cultures during cultivation. The results reveal that the extraction efficiencies of functionalized particles, particularly those coated with C18, demonstrated high potential as an alternative to traditional extraction methods. While the extraction efficiencies of coated microparticles are for most compounds lower than those observed for dodecane-based extractions, it holds higher potential for larger-scale cultivations where the use of dodecane is restricted due to its flammability and tendency to form emulsions. In addition, the present study provides insights into the optimization of particle-to-culture volume ratio, particle saturation, and the required number of product elution steps, and proves the feasibility of an upscaled extraction of the sesquiterpenoid patchoulol as a representative metabolite in 5 L hanging bag reactors. This study paves the way for a circular bioprocess where product capture with traditional solvent overlays is impractical due to the formation of emulsions, and at the same time allows for an easy product recovery (solid-liquid separation) and reuse of functionalized particles over numerous cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Just as attention can shift externally towards relevant objects in the visual environment, attention can shift internally towards (i.e., prioritize) VWM content that is relevant for upcoming tasks. Internal and external attentional selection share a number of key neural and functional characteristics, which include their spatial organization: recent work has shown that spatial attention is directed towards the previous location of a prioritized memory item, similar to how a perceived stimulus is prioritized. Attending stimuli that are physically present is useful, as it enhances processing of the relevant visual input. When prioritizing items in memory, however, attending the prior stimulus location cannot serve this purpose, as there is no visual input to enhance. Here, we address this apparent contradiction which highlights the gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying external and internal visual attention. In two EEG experiments, we compare location-specific sensory enhancement during the attentional selection of external (perceived) as compared to internal (memorized) stimuli. During both internal and external selection we observed a lateralization of alpha oscillations and gaze position bias toward the previous locations of prioritized items, confirming earlier findings that suggested an inherent spatial organization within VWM. Critically, using Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), we show that sensory enhancement at the attended location is only observed during external attentional selection of (perceived) stimuli. No such location-specific sensory enhancement was observed during attentional selection of items in VWM. Furthermore, we found no clear relationship across trials between alpha lateralization and sensory enhancement (measured through RIFT) during external attention, suggesting that these two metrics indeed reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms. In sum, using a novel combination of EEG and RIFT, we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between the neural mechanisms underlying the selection of perceived and memorized objects. Both types of selection operate within a spatial reference frame, but only external selection modulates early sensory processing. Our findings suggest that the visual system is not vestigially recruiting existing mechanisms of external attention for prioritization in VWM, but is instead using space as an organizational principle to store and select items in VWM.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Yet, disease expression is highly variable and includes very early-onset PKD presentations in utero or infancy. In animal models, the RNA-binding molecule Bicc1 has been shown to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PKD. Methods: To study the interaction between BICC1, PKD1 and PKD2 we combined biochemical approaches, knockout studies in mice and Xenopus, genetic engineered human kidney cells as well as genetic association studies in a large ADPKD cohort. Results: We first demonstrated that BICC1 physically binds to the proteins Polycystin-1 and -2 encoded by PKD1 and PKD2 via distinct protein domains. Furthermore, PKD was aggravated in loss-of-function studies in Xenopus and mouse models resulting in more severe disease when Bicc1 was depleted in conjunction with Pkd1 or Pkd2. Finally, in a large human patient cohort, we identified a sibling pair with a homozygous BICC1 variant and patients with very early onset PKD (VEO-PKD) that exhibited compound heterozygosity of BICC1 in conjunction with PKD1 and PKD2 variants. Genome editing demonstrated that these BICC1 variants were hypomorphic in nature and impacted disease-relevant signaling pathways. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that BICC1 cooperates functionally with PKD1 and PKD2, and that BICC1 variants may aggravate disease severity highlighting RNA metabolism as an important new concept for disease modification in ADPKD.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the MPOA for males and females of both Peromyscus species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in P. polionotus, a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior.

Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Besides the CTCF/cohesin machinery, only a few nuclear factors have been studied for a direct role in physically connecting regulatory elements. Here, we show via acute degradation experiments that LDB1 directly and broadly promotes enhancer-promoter loops. Most LDB1-mediated contacts, even those spanning hundreds of kb, can form in the absence of CTCF, cohesin, or YY1 as determined via the use of multiple degron systems. Moreover, an engineered LDB1-driven chromatin loop is cohesin independent. Cohesin-driven loop extrusion does not stall at LDB1 occupied sites but may aid the formation of a subset of LDB1 anchored loops. Leveraging the dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture during the transition from mitosis to G1-phase, we establish a relationship between LDB1-dependent interactions in the context of TAD organization and gene activation. Lastly, Tri-C and Region Capture Micro-C reveal that LDB1 organizes multi-enhancer networks to activate transcription. This establishes LDB1 as a direct driver of regulatory network inter-connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

However, a common confusion lies in equating the protein structure prediction problem with the protein folding problem. The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding principles, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2's high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow region of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape - more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2's learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 intermediate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2's energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Previous methods focused on higher heteroplasmy mutations that are limited in number and can be influenced by functional selection, introducing biases for lineage tracing. Although more challenging to detect, intermediate to low heteroplasmy mtDNA mutations are valuable due to their high diversity, abundance, and lower propensity to selection. To enhance mtDNA mutation detection and facilitate fine-scale lineage tracing, we developed the single-cell Regulatory multi-omics with Deep Mitochondrial mutation profiling (ReDeeM) approach, an integrated experimental and computational framework. Recently, some concerns have been raised about the analytical workflow in the ReDeeM framework. Specifically, it was noted that the mutations detected in a single molecule per cell are enriched on edges of mtDNA molecules, suggesting they resemble artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. It was then proposed that all mutations found in one molecule per cell should be removed. We detail our error correction method, demonstrating that the observed edge mutations are distinct from previously reported sequencing artifacts. We further show that the proposed removal leads to massive elimination of bona fide and informative mutations. Indeed, mutations accumulating on edges impact a minority of all mutation calls (for example, in hematopoietic stem cells, the excess mutations on the edge account for only 4.3%-7.6% of the total). Recognizing the value of addressing edge mutations even after applying consensus correction, we provide an additional filtering option in the ReDeeM-R package. This approach effectively eliminates the position biases, leads to a mutational signature indistinguishable from bona fide mitochondrial mutations, and removes excess low molecule high connectedness mutations. Importantly, this option preserves the large majority of unique mutations identified by ReDeeM, maintaining the ability of ReDeeM to provide a more than 10-fold increase in variant detection compared to previous methods. Additionally, the cells remain well-connected. While there is room for further refinement in mutation calling strategies, the significant advances and biological insights provided by the ReDeeM framework are unique and remain intact. We hope that this detailed discussion and analysis enables the community to employ this approach and contribute to its further development.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

We find that topical but not intravenous delivery is effective in this model. High-doses of phage reduces bacterial burden more effectively than low-doses, and repeated dosing achieves the highest eradication rates. Building on these insights, we developed ""HydroPhage"", a hyaluronan-based hydrogel system that uses dynamic covalent crosslinking to deliver high-titre phages over one week. HydroPhage eradicates infections five times more effectively than intravenous injection. We conclude that hydrogel-based sustained phage delivery enhances the efficacy of phage therapy and offers a practical, well-tolerated option for topical application.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds).

While rodent tissue has historically served as a source of these neurons, it has become increasingly clear that pain mechanisms in rodents and humans are substantially divergent. Sensory neurons harvested from cadaveric human tissue serve as a superior translational model for studying pain mechanisms, however their relative paucity limits their widespread utility. Theoretically, sensory neurons manufactured from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could help bridge this translational gap given their relative abundance and potential similarity to primary human tissue. However, hPSC-derived sensory neurons manufactured with the most common methodologies correlate poorly to human tissue both transcriptionally and functionally. In the present work, we compare a novel population of hPSC-derived sensory neurons to previously published datasets and find this novel population to more closely resemble human primary dorsal root ganglia transcriptionally. Furthermore, we evaluate the heterogeneity of this novel population via single nucleus RNA sequencing and find it resembles specific nociceptor and mechanoreceptor subsets found in vivo. Finally, we assay the functionality of this population with high throughput automated patch clamp electrophysiology with respect to voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and potassium channels (Kv), and ligand-gated ionotropic GABA and P2X receptors. Overall, we find this population of hPSC-derived sensory neurons to be of relatively high fidelity, and suitable for interrogating numerous potential pain targets on a fully humanized platform.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (""genetic distance""). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

In particular, red-shifted opsins offer access deeper within the brain tissue. It is however crucial to consider the potential unintended back-activation of endogenous opsins due to laser light striking the back of the retina. Here, we found that in complete darkness and with no expression of exogenous opsins, optical fiber laser stimulation at wavelengths of 637 nm (red), 594 nm (orange), or 473 nm (blue) from within the ipsilateral mouse visual cortex resulted in a strong neuronal response in its contralateral counterpart. This neuronal activation occurred even at low laser intensities (1mW at the fiber tip, 31.8mW/mm2) and was most pronounced using red wavelengths. We therefore took advantage of retinal light adaptation using external illumination with a relatively dim ambient light source (20 lux) which was found to completely abolish orange and blue laser-evoked neuronal activation from within the brain, even at high laser intensities (15mW, 477.3mW/mm2). To prevent red laser-evoked retinal activation, however, only much lower intensities (2.5mW, 79.6mW/mm2) combined with external illumination (20 lux) could be used. These findings demonstrate the critical need for careful selection of light wavelengths and intensities for laser stimulation during optogenetic experiments in the mouse brain in vivo. Additionally, light adaptation of the retina through ambient light exposure offers an effective solution to minimize unintended retinal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724882893027

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724882893027

At 30-days post-immunization, we observed homologous, NVX-CoV2373 primary-series and 1st-booster offered added protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection versus BNT162b2; while there was numerically lower risk of severe disease among NVX-CoV2373-vaccinated, no statistically significant differences were observed.","NA","medrxiv",1724882893027

This study compared leading commercial blood tests for amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.

MethodsPlasma samples from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were assayed with AD blood tests from C2N Diagnostics, Fujirebio Diagnostics, ALZPath, Janssen, Roche Diagnostics, and Quanterix. Outcomes measures were amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, cortical thickness, and dementia severity. Logistic regression models assessed the classification accuracies of individual or combined plasma biomarkers for binarized outcomes, and Spearman correlations evaluated continuous relationships between individual plasma biomarkers and continuous outcomes.

ResultsMeasures of plasma p-tau217, either individually or in combination with other plasma biomarkers, had the strongest relationships with all AD outcomes.

DiscussionThis study identified the plasma biomarker analytes and assays that most accurately classified amyloid pathology and other AD-related outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1724882893027

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724882893027
