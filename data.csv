To correctly determine the contributions of each fluorophore's signal to the high parameter data an accurate unmixing matrix needs to be generated. Even with single-stained controls, however, these matrixes include errors such as spillover spread, which compounds with each additional parameter, functionally limiting panel design. An additional source of errors is heterogeneity of cellular autofluorescence, which can affect both the unmixing matrix and misalign signals when the matrix is applied to individual cells in complex cell mixtures. Here we developed AutoSpectral, a statistical approach to automate the production of minimal-residual error unmixing matrixes and pair multiple distinct multifluorescent spectra to individual cells within a mixed sample, via an R-based software tool. AutoSpectral improves unmixing accuracy, improving incorrectly assigned cell positions by up to 9000-fold, reduces spread, particularly in samples with variable autofluorescence, and allows multi-lineage analysis of mixed populations, providing superior data for spectral flow cytometry experiments.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/Y004450/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""222442/A/21/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Since 2019, chicks on the New Zealand mainland have been affected by a deadly neonatal disease called respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), contributing to a decline to fewer than 143 breeding pairs. To investigate the putative genetic basis of this disease, we generated high-quality whole-genome data from 249 individuals spanning the species range, including from the New Zealand mainland (Northern range) and subantarctic Enderby and Campbell Islands (Southern). Population genomic analyses unexpectedly revealed three deeply divergent lineages with negligible gene flow, consistent with recognition of three distinct subspecies.

Phylogenetic divergence dating suggests that these splits predate human arrival by several millennia, with the Northern lineage diverging from the Southern populations 5-16 ka. Genome scans for local adaptation revealed regions of strong differentiation, and genome-wide association analyses identified candidate immune and respiratory genes linked to RDS. In partnership with Ng[a]i Tahu, who hold indigenous guardianship over yellow-eyed penguins, we recommend recognition of three subspecies, urgent conservation action for the critically small and rapidly declining Northern subspecies, and the need for immediate population size and trend assessments for Auckland and Campbell Island populations.","[{""name"":""Genomics Aotearoa"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Despite their widespread adoption, biological parts are complex and when used in a new molecular context can result in unexpected outcomes. Site-specific recombinases have been widely used due to their unique ability to induce precise, irreversible changes to a DNA sequence, making them ideal tools for memory logic operations. However, unexpected context-specific failures of even the most widely used recombinase, Cre, has limited the expansion and complexity of synthetic gene circuits in diverse species. Here, through a systematic analysis of Cre failure in plant gene circuits, we uncovered multiple unexpected post-recombination interactions within the transcriptional unit between the promoter region, recombinase, and their cognate recognition sites. These significantly inhibit transcriptional activity, preventing circuit functionality. Specifically, post-recombination Cre recombinase exhibits an inhibitory property by binding to lox sites, with the remaining lox site repressing transcription. By thoroughly characterizing these dynamics, we restored Cre functionality and expanded the plant-based recombinase toolkit for Cre-related recombinases, developing combinations of recombinases and cognate sites with different activation levels for constructing logic gates with stable memory functions. We further developed multiple functional split-recombinase systems for simultaneous logic using a range of dimerization domains and constructed complex logic gates, including 3-input and 6-input AND gates. Together, this exploration of component context dependency in genetic circuits, even with commonly used parts like the Cre/lox system, has implications extending beyond plant systems, and significantly expands plant memory circuit capabilities.","[{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240103385;DP210103954;""},{""name"":""ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Energy Biology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01a1mq059"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CE140100008;""},{""name"":""ARC Centre of Excellence in Plants for Space"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CE230100015;""},{""name"":""NHMRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1178460;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UWA Research Training Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Twist Bioscholar Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The University of Western Australia"",""id"":""https://ror.org/047272k79"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Grains Research and Development Corporation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xwr1996"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Drosophila larvae detect damaging heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli with specialized multidendritic (md) neurons, and these cells are among the only sensory neurons that survive metamorphosis. However, it remains unknown which somatosensory neurons contribute to nociception in adult flies. In an optogenetic screen, we found that abdominal md neurons were the only somatosensory class to induce rapid escape and sustained place avoidance. Calcium imaging from abdominal md axons revealed that they are activated by thermal nociceptive stimuli (>40 {degrees}C). Connectomic reconstruction showed that md axons form their strongest synaptic connections with ascending interneurons that project to the brain. Among these, we identified two classes of ascending neurons that mediate rapid escape responses and a third that supports sustained avoidance. Our findings reveal that adult Drosophila meet several core criteria commonly used to define pain: dedicated nociceptors, ascending pathways connecting peripheral sensors to integrative brain centers, and a capacity for sustained avoidance of noxious stimuli.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

These neurons are mapped onto a quantitative anatomical model of the insula based on a Nissl-staining coordinate framework. Using improved algorithms, we define 21 morphological, 12 electrical, and 9 input neuronal types, and identify several morphological and input types that are unique to the insula. Further, we find that morphological properties constrain and often predict inputs, electrical properties, or projection targets. Several morphological types are differentially distributed between the functionally distinct anterior and posterior insula, providing the substrates for a quantitative demarcation between the anterior and posterior insular subregions. Surprisingly, certain neuronal types receive intra-insular inputs originating far beyond canonical cortical columns. Functionally, these connections bridge a long-range thalamus-to-amygdalar circuit that potentially links sensory information to valence.

Many developmental genes are controlled by multiple, redundant enhancers, raising the question of how robust regulatory systems can be dismantled to permit phenotypic transitions. We show that the loss of larval trichomes in Drosophila sechellia resulted from the independent inactivation of four embryonic enhancers of the shavenbaby gene. Each enhancer was extinguished by a distinct mechanism: (1) a large deletion that removed essential sequences, (2) the loss of activator sites and gain of repressor sites, (3) the acquisition of a long-range silencer, and (4) the unmasking of pre-existing repression. Notably, three of these mechanisms relied on repression, pointing to repression as a rapid route for the evolutionary loss of robust regulatory elements. These results show that robustness in gene regulation does not prevent morphological change but instead provides multiple opportunities for mutations to reduce enhancer activity, giving selection many paths to reshape form.","[{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""No. 2567/20;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Here, we investigate the evolutionary origins and virological properties of a recently reported mink-derived HKU5-related coronavirus (nvHKU5r-CoV). Phylogenetic and recombination analyses reveal that nvHKU5r-CoV originated from bat HKU5-like viruses circulating in southeastern China. We characterize the spike loop2 region as a critical determinant of ACE2 receptor specificity, directly interacting with the receptor, and show that the bat HKU5r-CoV with the closest loop2 sequence to nvHKU5r-CoV could already utilize mink ACE2. Using AlphaFold3, we predicted spike-ACE2 binding interfaces consistent with our experimental infectivity results. Targeted mutagenesis demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution (R548S) enables robust entry of nvHKU5r-CoV via human ACE2. We further show that this substitution can arise in vitro during hACE2-expressing cell infection with a replication-competent VSV system. Molecular dating suggests that nvHKU5r-CoV transmitted from bats to mink within the last decade, consistent with an expansion of mink fur farming in China. Overall, our findings highlight the zoonotic potential of these viruses and the molecular and structural determinants underlying it, while emphasizing fur farming as a major risk factor for how bat HKU5r-CoVs can transmit to farmed animals and ultimately humans.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

In mammals, three main neuronal pathways through the BG have been described - the direct, indirect, and hyperdirect pathways - which together orchestrate many aspects of learning and behavior. In songbirds, cell types associated with striatal and pallidal components appear intermingled in a single basal ganglia nucleus, Area X, essential for song learning. This allows for the dense reconstruction of the entire circuit within a compact volume. Here, we introduce the first vertebrate basal ganglia connectome, comprising over 8,500 automated neuron reconstructions connected by about 20 million synapses. High image quality and automated reconstruction allowed analysis with minimal manual proofreading. Based on direct anatomical measurement of synaptic connectivity, we confirm that a direct, indirect and hyperdirect pathway can be traced through Area X. However, detailed morphological and connectomic analysis revealed no clearly distinct direct and indirect medium spiny neuron subpopulations, and a dominance of the direct and hyperdirect pathway. In addition to previously identified neuron types in Area X, we could distinguish three novel GABAergic neuron types, two of which are major output targets of GPe neurons, leading to novel feedback circuitry within Area X. We further found unexpectedly strong neuronal interconnectivity and recurrency between neurons associated with all pathways. Our data thus challenge the universality of the view of the basal ganglia as an information processor organized into discrete feedforward pathways.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Current methods, often linear and reliant on summary statistics, fail to capture complex genetic interactions and discard valuable individual-level information. We introduce PRSformer, a scalable deep learning architecture designed for end-to-end, multitask disease prediction directly from million-scale individual genotypes. PRSformer employs neighborhood attention, achieving linear O(L) complexity per layer, making Transformers tractable for genome-scale inputs. Crucially, PRSformer utilizes a stacking of these efficient attention layers, progressively increasing the effective receptive field to model local dependencies (e.g., within linkage disequilibrium blocks) before integrating information across wider genomic regions. This design, tailored for genomics, allows PRSformer to learn complex, potentially non-linear and long-range interactions directly from raw genotypes. We demonstrate PRSformer's effectiveness using a unique large private cohort (N{approx}5M) for predicting 18 autoimmune and inflammatory conditions using L{approx}140k variants. PRSformer significantly outperforms highly optimized linear models trained on the same individual-level data and state-of-the-art summary-statistic-based methods (LDPred2) derived from the same cohort, quantifying the benefits of non-linear modeling and multitask learning at scale. Furthermore, experiments reveal that the advantage of non-linearity emerges primarily at large sample sizes (N>1M), and that a multi-ancestry trained model improves generalization, establishing PRSformer as a new framework for deep learning in population-scale genomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Here, we dissect dopaminergic circuits controlling precision along a single behavioral dimension - the timing of action. We use an interval timing paradigm that requires participants to indicate their estimate of an interval of several seconds with a motor response. We find that humans with Parkinson's disease (PD) had increased timing variability that predicted PD-related cognitive deficits and executive dysfunction. Surprisingly, lesioning ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons increased temporal variability. Further, GCaMP6s fiber photometry demonstrated that VTA dopamine neuron activity is strongly modulated at the start of temporal intervals, and that this trial start related activity predicted temporal variability. Finally, we found that stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons improved timing by decreasing temporal variability in both intact and dopamine depleted animals. Our data establish a model of cognitive symptoms of human PD and provide insight into the neuronal control of temporal variability, which impacts a wide range of executive functions.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NS120987;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

In contrast, individuals with depression and low self-esteem are more likely to attribute failures to internal causes and successes to external causes.

Although causal attributions have been shown to influence belief formation and updating, the dynamic interaction between real-time attributions and self-related learning remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a validated self-related learning task to investigate how internal versus external attributions of performance feedback affect the formation of self-beliefs and how these processes relate to depressive symptoms and self-esteem. Drawing on a computational model that incorporates prediction error valence and causal attributions, we found that participants updated their self-beliefs less when feedback was attributed to external causes. Furthermore, individuals with higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem showed a stronger negativity bias in learning. Lower self-esteem was also linked to a reduced self-serving bias in attributions. These findings provide insight into the cognitive mechanisms that may contribute to the development and maintenance of negative self-beliefs commonly observed in depression.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KU 3955/3-1;MU 4373/1-1; MU 4373/1-3; KR 3803/11-1; 3803/14-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Such a decrease is often linked to the impact of visual memory decay and the sensory transformation of visual target positional information into haptic-specific coordinates. It is, however, unclear whether this holds for haptically encoded spatial locations, where the target and reaching arm positions are both defined through haptics. Here, we asked participants to perform memory-guided right-handed reaching movements toward targets held with the left hand. In the Delay block, the left hand was removed after 2 seconds, and a right-handed reach was performed after a variable delay of 2, 4, or 6 seconds. In the No-delay block, the left hand was on the target for the entire duration of the trial. Targets were positioned in front (Center) and to the Left of the participants, such that the posture of the left arm during encoding was either the same or different from the final posture of the contralateral reaching arm. The introduction of the shortest delay caused a decrease in accuracy and precision, indicating that on-line haptic inputs play a crucial role in guiding reaching movements. However, performance did not worsen with longer delays, particularly when the two arms were in similar postures. Our findings suggest that postural information may contribute to guiding actions when on-line haptic feedback is unavailable.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Our model was constrained by empirical human structural connectivity and spatial maps of cholinergic receptor gene expression, thereby embedding regional neuromodulatory variability into a macroscopic framework. We found that incorporating cholinergic heterogeneity had a significant impact on brain dynamics: it not only facilitated network synchronization but also enhanced information flow between brain regions. Furthermore, we addressed a particularly intricate dynamic regime characterized by the coexistence of localized sleep-like activity within otherwise awake-like states. We showed that the emergence of these slow waves was a byproduct of both regional levels of neuronal adaptation and structural connectivity.

To stabilize proteins during simulation, Martini is typically combined with structure-based force fields such as elastic network models (ENMs) or G[o] models. While these approaches preserve global folds and capture protein flexibility, their ability to reproduce conformational dynamics remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Martini combined with ENMs or G[o] models on three folded proteins and show that both approaches struggle to sample the conformational space observed in atomistic simulations, even when uniform interaction strengths or equilibrium bond distances are adjusted. This limitation arises from the assumption of a uniform interaction network, in which all bond energies are equal. To overcome this, we present a fully automated, perturbation-based optimization approach for G[o] networks, PoG[o], that iteratively refines a non-uniform G[o] network against a pre-computed atomistic free energy landscape in essential conformational space. Our approach converges rapidly, yielding CG ensembles in close agreement with reference atomistic simulations.

However, empirical evidence for consistent biodiversity-structure relationships across taxa is still limited. We investigated whether structurally more complex forests support greater species richness and higher multidiversity across taxonomic and functional groups in 19 mature forest plots in Flanders, Belgium. As one of the most densely populated and urbanized regions in Europe, with limited and highly fragmented forest cover, Flanders provides a particularly informative and policy-relevant context to test structure-biodiversity relationships. Its forests, often dominated by a few tree species and subject to long-term anthropogenic pressures and management, represent a realistic gradient of structural complexity. Structural complexity was quantified using a Structural Complexity Index (SCI), and biodiversity was assessed using a multidiversity index integrating scaled species richness across five taxonomic and seven arthropod functional groups. Using mixed-effects models and multivariate Bayesian analyses, we tested both direct effects of SCI on biodiversity and the covariation in species richness among groups. Contrary to expectations, SCI was not a consistent predictor of multidiversity, and most groups showed weak or inconsistent responses. These findings might suggest that structural complexity alone may be insufficient to enhance biodiversity in simplified forests.","[{""name"":""GOA project"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BOF20/GOA/009;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

This equilibrium is often disrupted in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition understood to exist along a continuum of traits in the general population. While ADHD is consistently linked to response inhibition deficits, its relationship with statistical learning (a mechanism for habit learning) and, crucially, the interaction between these functions, remains underexplored. Here, using a novel paradigm in a non-clinical sample of university students (n = 226), we investigated how ADHD-like traits modulate the interplay between response inhibition and statistical learning. We found that higher ADHD-like traits were associated with poorer response inhibition, confirming previous research. Importantly, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between inhibition and statistical learning, where weaker inhibitory control typically led to enhanced learning of environmental regularities. However, this learning advantage progressively diminished across the ADHD trait continuum, becoming markedly reduced in individuals with high symptom prevalence. These findings provide novel evidence that ADHD-like traits influence not only isolated neurocognitive processes but also their dynamic interaction, highlighting a spectrum-based mechanism that may underlie the transition from adaptive variability to maladaptive behavioral patterns. This work advocates for a dimensional approach to ADHD, emphasizing early detection and targeted interventions for individuals with varying levels of symptomatic expression, broadening support beyond traditional diagnostic boundaries.","[{""name"":""French National Grant Agency"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-22-CPJ1-0042-01;ANR-24-CE37-5807;""},{""name"":""National Brain Research Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NAP2022-I-2/2022;""},{""name"":""EKÖP-24 University Excellence Scholarship Program of the Ministry for Culture and Innovation from the Source of the National Research, Development and Innovation Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EKÖP-24-3-II-ELTE-1159;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which SHIP1 mediates its role in suppressing inflammatory pathways, with a focus on human microglia. Our findings illuminate an essential role for SHIP1 in endosome maturation and lysosomal function. We show that SHIP1 localizes to both the plasma membrane and to endo-lysosomal compartments and binds to the CapZ family of proteins, which are important for endosome maturation. Reduction of SHIP1 levels via genome editing impairs endosome maturation and lysosomal function, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and leakage of lysosomal cathepsin B into the cytosol, which in turn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. CITE-seq profiling of SHIP1-deficient microglia revealed a shift from an immune-responsive state toward a DAM-like, phagocytic state, accompanied by impaired response to LPS and enhanced phagocytosis of synaptic material and apoptotic neurons via TREM2. While amyloid {beta} uptake was not affected, amyloid {beta} accumulated intracellularly due to defective lysosomal degradation, further driving lipid droplet formation. Together, these results identify SHIP1 as a regulator of endo-lysosomal function and selective phagocytosis of lipid-rich substrates in microglia. These findings have important implications for therapeutic hypotheses that target SHIP1 for treatment of AD, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U01AG072572;R01AG055909;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CS-02018-191971;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Zenith Award;""},{""name"":""Harvard Medical School"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wevmz92"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Edward R. and Anne G.

In this study, we analyzed the vaginal microbiome and metabolome of 258 healthy women from the Isala program. Using targeted metabolomics analysis, we detected a high prevalence with strong interpersonal differences of most B-vitamins, their precursors, and vitamin A in the vaginal microenvironment. Riboflavin (B2) and biotin (B7) showed strong associations with Lactobacillus crispatus and Limosilactobacillus sp.

Resistance to FHB in wheat is broadly classified as resistance to initial infection (type I) or resistance to disease spread within the spike (type II). A high level of type I FHB resistance was reported in an accession of wheat wild relative Triticum timopheevii. Hexaploid wheat-T. timopheevii introgression lines carrying a segment of the short arm of chromosome 3G (Chr3G) of this accession expressed high levels of FHB resistance following spray inoculation. Further analyses of these introgression lines showed that the Chr3G segment confers a potent type II resistance, accompanied by improved grain weight retention, and reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation in grain. These results indicate that the Chr3G resistance has the potential to dramatically reduce FHB susceptibility and DON accumulation in grain in wheat cultivars. An introgression of a segment of Chr7At into the short arm of chromosome Chr7A also enhanced type II FHB resistance.","[{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/P016855/1;BB/X011003/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

We discovered that the host peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin A (PPIA/CypA), was essential for the formation of the R. parkeri actin tails that enable pathogen motility. PPIA localized to actin-associated bacterial poles and directly interacted with Sca2, the R. parkeri surface-exposed autotransporter chiefly responsible for actin tail nucleation. Sca2 bound PPIA through a domain implicated in surface translocation, and Sca2 failed to reach the R. parkeri surface in PPIA-deficient host cells. We propose that host PPIA enables Sca2 surface exposure during R. parkeri infection through a direct interkingdom protein maturation event, which represents an unexplored axis of the intracellular host-bacterial interface.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI155489;R01GM141025;F32AI172121;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

To address this, we used directed evolution in human cells to select variants with greatly improved homology-directed repair (HDR) activity. The resulting variants, Cas12f1Super and TnpBSuper, exhibited up to 11-fold increase in editing efficiency without increased off-target effects.

In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitors are patterned into molecularly defined domains, but how lineage relationships shape neuronal diversity and function has remained unclear. Here, we combine genomic barcoding with single- cell RNA sequencing in chick and human embryos to generate cell-type-resolved clonal maps. We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception. Together, these findings provide a framework for spinal cord development and reveal lineage compartmentalisation as a fundamental principle in neural circuit assembly and evolution.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051),;""},{""name"":""Wellcome"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;220379/D/20/Z;218670/Z/19/Z;215116/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CC001051;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""742138;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""792-2021;""},{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X031225/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Acute stress is known to impact the hippocampus but may have opposite effects on these competing functions. That is, although stress impairs episodic encoding, it may instead enhance statistical learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we tested how stress influences the hippocampal pathways and subfields that support episodic encoding and statistical learning while participants performed a task that engaged both processes. Across several analyses, stress biased hippocampal processing in favour of statistical learning, suppressing pattern separation between events in the dentate gyrus and enhancing the representation of statistically predictive features. Furthermore, stress drove the hippocampal monosynaptic pathway to support statistical learning rather than episodic encoding during predictive situations. Together, these data suggest that acute stress elicits targeted, adaptive changes in hippocampal pathways which may facilitate predicting and responding to upcoming events.","[{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21MH128740;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Applying velotest across multiple datasets and embedding methods, we find strong differences in the embedding qualities between embedding methods, datasets, and regions in individual datasets. velotest thus provides an essential validation step and enables researchers to select a suitable visualization of high-dimensional velocities, ensuring that hypotheses drawn from velocity projections are grounded in accurately represented dynamics.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390727645;520388526;""},{""name"":""Bundesministerium für Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""01IS18039;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

A typical cell contains ~1000s of copies of mtDNA, but how this copy number is stably maintained is unclear. Here, we track mtDNA copy number (mtCN) recovery in K562 cells following transient, chemically induced depletion to uncover principles of mtCN stability. Below a critical mtCN, ETC activity fails to sustain the proton motive force (PMF) and de novo pyrimidine synthesis - both required for mtDNA replication. PMF-dependent processes like Fe-S cluster biogenesis are also disrupted and stress responses are activated that impair cell proliferation and limit further mtCN dilution by cell division. Nonetheless, mtDNA replication and recovery remain possible via mtDNA-independent PMF, generated by complex V reversal, and uridine salvage. Once mtCN is restored, the ETC and forward complex V activity re-engage, stress responses subside, and proliferation recommences. Each cell division then dilutes mtDNA, serving as a built-in brake on mtCN. Our findings suggest that mtCN homeostasis emerges from the balance of two opposing PMF-driven processes - mtDNA replication and cell proliferation - revealing a bioenergetic logic that preserves mtDNA euploidy through repeated cell divisions.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K00CA212468;K99GM145848;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Understanding and optimising transgene expression is crucial for a wide variety of applications which range from investigating basic biology, synthetic biology, recombinant protein production to gene therapy. However, precise control over the timing and location of transgene expression remains a key limitation, particularly in therapeutic contexts where specificity and compactness are critical. To address limitations of traditional promoter-based transgene construct approaches, we developed TRANCERs (TRanscriptionally Autonomous enhaNCERs), a modular and compact system that transforms cell type-specific enhancers into standalone sources of productive transcription. To accomplish this, we leveraged basic facets of enhancer function as well as known and novel principles of transcript stability and nuclear export. We demonstrate that TRANCERs can drive lineage-restricted expression of both reporter and therapeutic genes across multiple mammalian cell types both in vitro and in vivo, and that this expression pattern faithfully mirrors the activity of the enhancer element used. Enhancer elements are the most cell type specific element in the mammalian genome and are used to drive development, differentiation and cellular responses to extrinsic signals. Therefore, the TRANCER system allows for the generation of specific stable expression constructs for all conceivable situations for which a native enhancer exists with the required activity pattern. Furthermore, we show that the TRANCER system is compatible with previously published machine learning derived artificial enhancer sequences suggesting the possibility even for specific bespoke expression patterns that do not exist in nature.

However, the large number of features generated by functional connectivity approaches may overfit the data. These problems can be overcome with either feature selection (FS) or dimensionality reduction (DR), which can be applied to less complex models. We utilize two open-source datasets to compare the performance of DR/FS methods on cognitive task decoding using a suite of ML classifiers. New Method While DR and FS methods have been used previously in decoding research, no systematic comparison of their performance has been undertaken. Here, we compare available methods using commonly utilized machine learning libraries to establish which methods provide the best predictive performance. We then conduct statistical tests to examine the relative contributions of DR and FS methods and classifiers on decoding accuracy. Results Neither DR or FS was found to be superior. However, differences were identified across datasets and tasks. In the majority of methods and datasets, a peak in predictive performance was found using a small percentage of the total number of original features. Comparison with existing methods Some methods perform better than the baseline method of prediction with all available features or selecting features randomly. Decoding performance utilizing the HCP datasets with certain DR/FS methods exceeds that of deep learning approaches. Conclusions Simple machine learning models with DR/FS have competitive decoding performance. These results suggest a sweet spot for the tradeoff between the retention of features and predictive accuracy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Using high-throughput genome-engineering in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we systematically replace the endogenous Sox9 promoter with different libraries of core and extended (i.e. full) promoters and assess their response to long-range regulatory elements in mESCs and neural progenitor cells. We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters. Our results suggest that within multipartite regulatory domains, the promoter-proximal region fulfills a facilitator-like function that filters and transmits signal from distal enhancers, ultimaltely conferring enhancer-promoter compatibility.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076709;101125530;813327;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IB 139/6-1;KR 5247/1-1;KR 5247/1-2;KR 5247/1-3;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

However, some species undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), whereby specific genome regions are removed from somatic cell lineages early during development, leading to distinct germline and somatic genomes. Since its discovery in parasitic nematodes over a century ago, PDE has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliates, arthropods, and vertebrates. However, the function, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of PDE remain poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of PDE in three early-diverging Caenorhabditis species. Using long-read and chromatin conformation capture sequencing, we reconstructed germline and somatic genomes for all three species, and found that between 0.7 and 2.3% of the genome is eliminated during the 8- to 16-cell stage of embryogenesis, including the telomeres and regions within chromosomes. Elimination of regions within chromosomes results in fragmentation of the six germline chromosomes into 8-15 somatic chromosomes. The sites of elimination are precise, and we identified conserved motifs that likely recruit a nuclease to induce double-strand breaks. The newly formed somatic chromosome ends are healed by de novo telomere addition. A small number of genes are eliminated in each species, some of which have C. elegans orthologues with essential germline functions. A subset of elimination sites are orthologous across species, and some coincide with genome rearrangement sites. The phylogenetic distribution of PDE suggests that it was present in the last common Caenorhabditis ancestor and subsequently lost early during the evolution of many species, including C. elegans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220540/Z/20/A;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJCR18S7;JPMJCR24B4;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP23K17400;JP24H00549;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has been found to be reduced in AD patients; butyrate supplementation improved cognition and decreased amyloid burden in animal models. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that insulin signaling impacts A transport kinetics at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the effect of butyrate treatment on intra-endothelial A accumulation and BBB integrity by modulating the insulin signaling pathway. The effect of butyrate on A accumulation was assessed by flow cytometry in BBB cell culture models. Insulin signaling activation and the expression of various receptors and transporters at the BBB were evaluated by Western blots and confocal microscopy. The roles of various molecular mediators were confirmed using specific inhibitors (MK2206, Trametinib, Rapamycin, VX-745). The effect of butyrate on the expression of BBB receptors and transporters that play a critical role in A trafficking was examined in mouse brains colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria via immunohistochemistry. Butyrate significantly decreased A{beta}42 accumulation in endothelial cells. This effect was associated with insulin signaling pathway activation, particularly AKT and ERK phosphorylation. Inhibitor studies established the critical role of these specific arms, as co-incubation with MK2206 (AKT inhibitor) or Trametinib (ERK inhibitor) reversed the protective effect of butyrate and increased A{beta}42 accumulation. However, mTOR and p38 inhibitors did not show a similar effect. In addition, butyrate restored P-glycoprotein efflux transporter expression and claudin-5 tight junction protein levels that were reduced with A{beta} treatment. These effects were supported by in vivo work, which demonstrated the upregulation of Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). This protein is associated with AKT activation and extracellular matrix stabilization in mice colonized with butyrate-producing bacteria. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that butyrate decreases A{beta}42 uptake at the BBB endothelium by activating the AKT and ERK arms of the insulin signaling pathway. These changes may also improve the integrity of BBB tight junctions by increasing claudin-5 expression and extracellular matrix, and by upregulating TIMP-2 expression. This study highlights butyrates potential as a therapeutic modulator of AD-related BBB dysfunction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

All previously characterized retrons produce high levels of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) in the cell by reverse transcription, which acts as an antitoxin in the absence of phage infection. However, we describe here a non-canonical mechanism for Type VI retrons, which do not produce detectable msDNA in the absence of phage, yet still provide phage defense. Focusing primarily on Retron-Vpa2, a Type VI retron from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we show broad defense against phages and identify triggers of the system within phage recombination systems. Within the Retron-Vpa2 operon, we find a highly enriched, structured transcript that we term a hybrid RNA (hyRNA), which contains both the retrons reverse transcription template and a translationally repressed toxic effector coding sequence. We find that phage infection induces the accumulation of high levels of msDNA and that this msDNA is necessary for derepressing translation of the antiviral toxin. These findings present key biological and mechanistic insights into a distinct group of retrons while highlighting the diversity of systems that participate in bacterial immunity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses.

ResultsWe performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end--either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences.

ConclusionsOur results highlight the impact of complex barcode attachments in Nanopore sequencing and demonstrate that Barbell drastically reduces their effects on downstream analyses.

We apply TF-MAPS to three human disease TFs: HNF1A, FOXG1 and FOXP1. Allostery in all three proteins is distance-dependent, anisotropic, and couples the DNA-binding interface to the protein surface. The allosteric surfaces of FOXG1 and FOXP1 are quite diverged, revealing a potential for protein-specific regulation in protein families. All three TFs have potentially druggable pockets where mutations have strong functional effects on binding, either within the binding interface or distant from it.

Understanding how gut microbes interact and contribute to plastic degradation is essential for developing potential microbiome-based bioremediation strategies. We isolated 184 microbes from wild Alaskan threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) guts across six lakes and screened for plastic degrading potential using lipase/esterase assays and biofilm formation on PET and PP. During the screen for microbes with plastic degrading potential, we discovered that stickleback gut microbiota members enhance and suppressed the lipase, esterase, and biofilm activity of other microbes. Isolates with the highest plastic degrading potential were incubated in minimal media with PET or PP as the sole carbon source to determine whether plastic degradation potential is enhanced. Surface analysis identified a Pseudomonas trivialis strain that exhibited degradation of PP in monoculture; however, this activity was suppressed in the presence of another gut isolate, Pseudomonas germanica. These results demonstrate that microbes associated with the wild threespine stickleback gut microbiome possess plastic degradation potential and provide insights into how microbial interactions can either promote or inhibit bioremediation of plastic pollution in cold-water environments.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-253562-5022;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R15GM122038;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1126100;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

In this work, we develop an end-to-end automation strategy for repeat-target structure determination using new tools in CryoSPARC. We demonstrate completely hands-off processing of 21 challenging G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) datasets. In 17 of 21 cases, automated processing meets or exceeds published resolution and map quality and, in several cases, provides significant improvement in receptor and ligand density that allows improved model building. Our results on both active and inactive state GPCRs show that our automation strategy generalizes easily to new target classes, and that complete automation of data processing is straightforward to achieve in CryoSPARC. We provide downloadable CryoSPARC Workflow files so that users can import, replicate, adapt and extend our automated workflow for their own targets, enabling cryo-EM to be applied at larger scales and to answer larger biological questions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Here, we present the cryoEM structures of an RNA free and a 5 promoter bound complex, describing the core catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We observe an RdRp that is substantially larger than related L-proteins and contains domain insertions unique to the nairovirus family. The 5 RNA promoter is found in a tight RNA hairpin stabilised by a single base pair, with 5 binding triggering the closure of protein over the RNA. Functional analysis of the endonuclease and RdRp activities reveals an enzyme which is capable of both activities and demonstrate RdRp inhibition by known antiviral nucleosides. These data advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind genome replication and transcription, that will help inform future antiviral development.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route.

We have dissected ssDNA gap dynamics following nucleoside analogue-mediated nascent strand termination and report a novel mechanism via which loss of the MRE11 negative regulator MRN-Interacting Protein (MRNIP) leads to MRE11 exonuclease-dependent suppression of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. This process is driven by UBC13 and the B-family TLS polymerase REV3L, suggesting that in the absence of MRNIP, dysregulated MRE11 activity at chain termination sites licenses gap filling via template switching. In the absence of PRIMPOL-dependent repriming, MRNIP loss leads to paradoxical SMARCAL1, MRE11 and primosome-dependent ssDNA gaps, suggesting that nucleolytic digestion of reversed forks generates DNA intermediates that platform primase redundancy in the context of chain termination. We also highlight novel site-specific roles for the anti-resection factor 53BP1 in enabling primase redundancy via suppression of the nuclease EXO1, and in limiting the EXO1-dependent processing of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. Finally, we demonstrate that CDK-dependent MRNIP phosphorylation is required for MRNIP functionality in the regulation of ssDNA gaps and sensitivity to chain terminators.

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802460

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802461

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone. Overall, this work highlights a new approach for maintaining healthy bone ageing in cancer survivors.","[{""name"":""American Federation for Aging Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000r61a05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Hevolution/AFAR New Investigator Award in Aging Biology;""},{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""APP1139763;APP1127821;APP2009940;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802461

This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis.

In mixed lysogenic cultures, these interactions shape induction outcomes, demonstrating ecological relevance. We extent these findings to infection contexts, showing that arbitrium signalling influences outcomes in cells harbouring prophages with compatible communicating systems.

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802461

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/051aqjh92"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761775802461
