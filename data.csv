There exists a paucity of genetic studies that can shed light on potential mechanisms leading to Long COVID. Using consented and genotyped data from 23andMe adult research participants, we conducted the largest multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of Long COVID across European (42,899 cases, 94,721 controls), Latinx (8,631 cases, 20,351 controls), and African-American (2,234 cases, 5,596 controls) genetic ancestry groups. GWAS of Long COVID identified three genome-wide significant loci (HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB, ABO, BPTF:KPAN2:C17orf58). Functional analysis of these genes points to underlying immune and thrombo-inflammatory mechanisms. We present evidence of shared genetic architecture (genetic correlation p-value < 0.001) of Long COVID with thirteen phenotypes of similar symptomatology or pathophysiology. We identified potential causal roles from liability to chronic fatigue (Mendelian randomization OR=1.59, 95% CI[1.51,1.66]), fibromyalgia (OR=1.54, 95% CI[1.49,1.60]), and depression (OR=1.53, 95% CI[1.46,1.61]) with Long COVID, which replicated in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative data, and which are unlikely to originate from collider bias. These findings can help identify populations vulnerable to Long COVID and inform future therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

Despite this, no studies have employed proteomics to characterize host immune responses to severe pediatric vLRTI in both the lower airway and systemic circulation. To address this gap, gain insights into vLRTI pathophysiology, and test a novel diagnostic approach, we assayed 1,305 proteins in tracheal aspirate (TA) and plasma from 62 critically ill children using SomaScan. We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analyses comparing vLRTI (n=40) to controls with non-infectious acute respiratory failure (n=22), developed a diagnostic classifier using LASSO regression, and analyzed matched TA and plasma samples. We further investigated the impact of viral load and bacterial coinfection on the proteome. The TA signature of vLRTI was characterized by 200 DE proteins (Padj<0.05) with upregulation of interferons and T cell responses and downregulation of inflammation-modulating proteins including FABP and MIP-5. A nine-protein TA classifier achieved an AUC of 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-1.00) for identifying vLRTI. In plasma, the host response to vLRTI was more muted with 56 DE proteins. Correlation between TA and plasma was limited, although ISG15 was elevated in both compartments. In bacterial coinfection, we observed increases in the TNF-stimulated protein TSG-6, as well as CRP, and interferon-related proteins. Viral load correlated positively with interferon signaling and negatively with neutrophil-activation pathways. Taken together, our study provides fresh insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI, and identifies novel protein biomarkers with diagnostic potential.

IMPORTANCEWe describe the first proteomic profiling of the lower airway and blood in critically ill children with severe viral lower respiratory tract infection (vLRTI). From tracheal aspirate (TA), we defined a proteomic signature of vLRTI characterized by increased expression of interferon signaling proteins and decreased expression of proteins involved in immune modulation including FABP and MIP-5. Using machine learning, we developed a parsimonious diagnostic classifier that distinguished vLRTI from non-infectious respiratory failure with high accuracy. Comparative analysis of paired TA and plasma specimens demonstrated limited concordance, although the interferon-stimulated protein ISG15 was significantly upregulated with vLRTI in both compartments. We further identified TSG-6 and CRP as airway biomarkers of bacterial-viral coinfection, and viral load analyses demonstrated positive correlation with interferon-related protein expression and negative correlation with the expression of neutrophil activation proteins. Taken together, our study provides new insight into the lower airway and systemic proteome of severe pediatric vLRTI.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Understanding how a cis-regulatory landscape integrates information from many dynamically expressed TFs has remained a challenge. We develop a combined CRISPR-screening approach using endogenous RNA and RE-reporters as readouts. Applied to the Xist locus, crucial for X-chromosome inactivation in females, this method allows us to comprehensively identify Xist-controlling TFs and map their TF-RE wiring. We find a group of transiently expressed TFs that regulate proximal REs, driving the binary activation of Xist expression. These basal activators are more highly expressed in cells with two X chromosomes, potentially driving female-specific Xist upregulation. A second set of developmental TFs is upregulated later during differentiation and targets distal REs. This regulatory axis is crucial to achieve high levels of Xist RNA, which is necessary for X-chromosome inactivation. Our findings support a model for developmental gene regulation in which factors targeting proximal REs drive binary ON-OFF decisions, while factors interacting with distal REs control the transcription output.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

We report genome-wide data from 248 ancient individuals from the largely unsampled period 100-800 CE and co-analyze them with previously reported data. In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Many proteins exert their functions through interactions with other proteins, and a significant challenge is designing these interactions effectively. While most efforts have focused on larger, more stable proteins, shorter peptides offer advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, reduced steric hindrance, and the ability to traverse cell membranes when cyclized. However, less structural data is available for peptides and their flexibility makes them harder to design. Here, we present a method to design both novel linear and cyclic peptide binders of varying lengths based solely on a protein target sequence. Our approach does not specify a binding site or the length of the binder, making the procedure completely blind. We demonstrate that linear and cyclic peptide binders of different lengths can be designed with nM affinity in a single shot, and adversarial designs can be avoided through orthogonal in silico evaluation, tripling the success rate.

Plasma-positive microglia are characterized by prominent expression of genes related to innate immunity and antigen presentation and exhibit high metabolic and phagocytic activity.

Given the relatively small number of signaling pathways, the existence of multiple related ligands for many of these pathways is thought to represent a key evolutionary innovation for encoding complexity into cell-cell signaling. Relatedly, crosstalk and other interactions between pathways is another critical feature which allows a modest number pathways to ultimately generate an enormously diverse range of outcomes. It would thus be useful to have genetic tools to identify and manipulate not only those cells which express a given signaling ligand, but also those cells that specifically co-express pairs of signaling ligands. Here, we present a collection of split-Gal4 knock-in lines targeting many of the ligands for highly conserved signaling pathways in Drosophila (Notch, Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, TGF, JAK/STAT, JNK, and PVR). We demonstrate that these lines faithfully recapitulate the endogenous expression pattern of their targets, and that they can be used to specifically identify the cells and tissues that co-express pairs of signaling ligands. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that the 4th chromosome TGFligands myoglianin and maverick are broadly co-expressed in muscles and other tissues of both larva and adults, and that the JAK/STAT ligands upd2 and upd3 are partially co-expressed from cells of the midgut following gut damage. Together with our previously collection of split-Gal4 lines targeting the seven Wnt ligands, this resource allows Drosophila researchers to identify and genetically manipulate cells that specifically express pairs of conserved ligands from nearly all the major intercellular signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

In species with large ranges, high latitude breeding populations may employ different migratory strategies allowing them to persist far from other core non-breeding areas. The myrtle warbler (Setophaga coronata coronata) has two disjunct non-breeding ranges in North and Central America: one along the Gulf Coast and the other on the Pacific. Previous work indirectly linked birds breeding in Alaska with the Pacific non-breeding area, suggesting that high latitude populations evolved a shorter migration route. We directly tested this hypothesis using geolocators measuring both light and atmospheric pressure to track Alaskan myrtle warbler migration in fine detail and inferred non-breeding areas using hydrogen isotopes for a larger sample of birds breeding in Alaska, British Columbia, and Alberta. We found, contrary to expectations, that all geolocator-tracked birds and most birds with stable isotope data migrated to the southeastern United States, while only a small subset of birds (~5%) likely wintered on the Pacific Coast. We additionally demonstrate the advantages of pressure geolocation for characterizing migratory behavior at a fine scale.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

We used de novo protein design to first generate binders to individual IR extracellular domains, and then to fuse these together in different orientations and with different conformational flexibility. We describe a series of synthetic agonists that signal through the IR that differ from insulin and from each other in the induction of receptor autophosphorylation, MAPK activation, intracellular trafficking, and cell proliferation. We identify designs that are more potent than insulin causing much longer lasting reductions in glucose levels, and that retain signaling activity on disease-causing receptor mutants that do not respond to insulin.

We also conducted regional assessments of species numbers, which allowed us to refine global estimates by providing an accurate overview of the taxonomic deficit in different latitudinal locations on the planet. Our results allow us to propose a conservative estimation of global diversity of the order of 30,000 species. This means that the 5,679 species and subspecies already described represent at best around 20% of the global number of earthworm species. Considering the current rate of new species description, we calculate that it would take at least 120 years to describe all the species existing on Earth.

Upon activation, eosinophils release cytotoxic proteins such as major basic protein-1 (MBP-1) from cytoplasmic secretory granules (SGr) wherein MBP-1 is stored as nanocrystals. How the MBP-1 nanocrystalline core is formed, stabilized, and subsequently mobilized remains unknown. Here, we report the in-situ structure of crystalline MBP-1 within SGrs of human eosinophils. The structure reveals a mechanism for intragranular crystal packing and stabilization of MBP-1 via a structurally conserved loop region that is associated with calcium-dependent carbohydrate binding in other C-type lectin (CTL) proteins. Single-cell and single-SGr profiling correlating real-space three-dimensional information from cellular montage cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data obtained from non-activated and IL33-activated eosinophils revealed activation-dependent crystal expansion and extrusion of expanded crystals from SGr.

While traditionally viewed as a waste product, lactate is an important energy source for many organs, but first must be oxidized to pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). This reaction is thought to occur in the cytosol, with pyruvate subsequently transported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Using 13C stable isotope tracing, we demonstrated that lactate is oxidized in the myocardial tissue of mice even when the MPC is genetically deleted. This MPC-independent lactate import and mitochondrial oxidation is dependent upon the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/Slc16a1). Mitochondria isolated from the myocardium without MCT1 exhibit a specific defect in mitochondrial lactate, but not pyruvate, metabolism. The import and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of lactate by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts as an electron shuttle, generating sufficient NADH to support respiration even when the TCA cycle is disrupted. In response to diverse cardiac insults, animals with hearts lacking MCT1 undergo rapid progression to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, the mitochondrial import and oxidation of lactate enables carbohydrate entry into the TCA cycle to sustain cardiac energetics and maintain myocardial structure and function under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Current state-of-the-art models are primarily evaluated using two categories of in silico metrics: sequence-based metrics, such as amino acid recovery (AAR), and structure-based metrics, including root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), predicted alignment error (pAE), and interface predicted template modeling (ipTM). While metrics such as pAE and ipTM have been shown to be useful filters for experimental success, there is no evidence that they are suitable for ranking, particularly for antibody sequence designs. Furthermore, no reliable sequence-based metric for ranking has been established. In this work, using real-world experimental data from seven diverse datasets, we extensively benchmark a range of generative models, including LLM-style, diffusion-based, and graph-based models. We show that log-likelihood scores from these generative models correlate well with experimentally measured binding affinities, suggesting that log-likelihood can serve as a reliable metric for ranking antibody sequence designs. Additionally, we scale up one of the diffusion-based models by training it on a large and diverse synthetic dataset, significantly enhancing its ability to predict and score binding affinities.

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

Despite its importance in human development, gastrulation remains difficult to study. Stem cell-based embryo models, including those that recapitulate different aspects of pre- and peri-gastrulation human development5-15, are emerging as promising tools for studying human embryogenesis16-18. However, it remains unclear whether existing human embryo models are capable of modeling the development of the trilaminar embryonic disc structure, a hallmark of human gastrulation. Here we report a transgene-free human embryo model derived solely from primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), which recapitulates various aspects of peri-gastrulation human development, including formation of trilaminar embryonic layers situated between dorsal amnion and ventral definitive yolk sac and primary hematopoiesis. We term this model the peri-gastrulation trilaminar embryonic disc (PTED) embryoid. The development of PTED embryoid does not follow natural developmental sequences of cell lineage diversification or spatial organization. Instead, it exploits both extrinsic control of tissue boundaries and intrinsic self-organizing properties and embryonic plasticity of the diverse peri-gastrulation-stage cell lineages, leading to the emergence of in vivo-like tissue organization and function at a global scale. Our lineage tracing study reveals that in PTED embryoids, embryonic and extraembryonic mesoderm cells, as well as embryonic and extraembryonic endoderm cells, share common progenitors emerging during peri-gastrulation development. Active hematopoiesis and blood cell generation are evident in the yolk sac-like structure of PTED embryoids. Together, PTED embryoids provide a promising and ethically less challenging model for studying self-organizing properties of peri-gastrulation human development.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

SoxC transcription factors regulate diverse downstream targets, including Tead2, Mdk, and Klf4, thereby regulating crucial steps of colon development.

Here, we present an extensive study of foundation models pre-trained on DNA sequences, named the Nucleotide Transformer, ranging from 50M up to 2.5B parameters and integrating information from 3,202 diverse human genomes, as well as 850 genomes selected across diverse phyla, including both model and non-model organisms. These transformer models yield transferable, context-specific representations of nucleotide sequences, which allow for accurate molecular phenotype prediction even in low-data settings. We show that the developed models can be fine-tuned at low cost and despite low available data regime to solve a variety of genomics applications. Despite no supervision, the transformer models learned to focus attention on key genomic elements, including those that regulate gene expression, such as enhancers. Lastly, we demonstrate that utilizing model representations can improve the prioritization of functional genetic variants.

While comprehensive assemblies of these regions have been established in the human genome, they are still lacking in the mouse genome. In this study, we used PacBio long-read sequencing, CUT&RUN sequencing, DNA methylation analysis, and RNA sequencing to generate genomic and epigenomic maps of these regions. We find that centromeric regions are primarily occupied by 120-mer Minor satellites, with other Minor Satellite length variants, 112-mers and 112-64-dimers, localized at centromere-pericentric junctions. Pericentromeric regions are mainly composed of homogeneous Major satellites, while pericentric-chromosomal junctions contain a higher density of divergent satellites. Additionally, the density of non-satellite repeats increases progressively from centromeres to pericentromeres, and further toward chromosomal arm junctions. We found that 120-mer Minor satellites in the core centromere are highly enriched with CENP-A, while the 112-mers and 112-64-dimers show lower CENP-A levels. Homogeneous Major satellites are more enriched with H3K9me3 heterochromatin, whereas divergent Major satellites are preferentially associated with H3K27me3. Furthermore, DNA methylation levels are lower in centromeres compared to pericentric regions. We also observed that only a small subset of satellites is transcribed into RNA, particularly regions exhibiting lower DNA methylation density.

Here we demonstrate that the -opioid receptor (MOR), a Gi- coupled GPCR, increases endosomal G protein activity in a different way. Leveraging conformational biosensors, we resolve the subcellular activation dynamics of endogenously expressed MOR and Gi/o-subclass G proteins. We show that MOR activation triggers a transient increase of active-state Gi/o on the plasma membrane that is followed by a prolonged increase on endosomes. Contrary to the Gs-coupled GPCR paradigm, however, we show that the MOR- induced increase of active-state Gi/o on endosomes requires neither internalization of MOR nor activation of MOR in the endosome membrane. We propose a distinct and additional cellular mechanism for GPCR-triggered elevation of G protein activity on endosomes that is mediated by regulated trafficking of the activated G protein rather than its activating GPCR.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely related (~11 MY divergence) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and we demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This contrasts with patterns of viral adaptation in humans, which may contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Attachment of phages to bacterial cells is a crucial initial step of the interaction. The classic assay to quantify the dynamics of phage attachment involves co-culturing and enumeration of bacteria and phages, which is laborious, lengthy, hence low-throughput, and only provides ensemble estimates of model-based adsorption rate constants. Here, we utilized fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking to obtain trajectories of individual virus particles interacting with cells. The trajectory durations quantified the heterogeneity in dwell time, the time that each phage spends interacting with a bacterium. The average dwell time strongly correlated with the classically-measured adsorption rate constant. We successfully applied this technique to quantify host-attachment dynamics of several phages including those targeting key bacterial pathogens. This approach should benefit the field of phage biology by providing highly quantitative, model-free readouts at single-virus resolution, helping to uncover single-virus phenomena missed by traditional measurements.

Latin American samples are significantly underrepresented in global cancer genomics studies, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures. To address this, here we characterise the genome and transcriptome of 128 acral melanoma tumours from 96 Mexican patients, a population notable because of its genetic admixture. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer frequent mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. While most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations and a lower number of structural variants. These BRAF-mutated tumours have a transcriptional profile similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, suggesting that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared to other tumours arising in these locations. KIT mutations were found in a subset of these tumours, and transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with overall survival. We highlight novel low-frequency drivers, such as SPHKAP, which correlate with a distinct genomic profile and clinical characteristics. Our study enhances knowledge of this understudied disease and underscores the importance of including samples from diverse ancestries in cancer genomics studies.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

To investigate interactions in the mycobacterial oxidative phosphorylation machinery, we prepared inverted membrane vesicles from Mycobacterium smegmatis and enriched for vesicles containing complexes of interest by affinity chromatography. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) of these vesicles revealed that malate-quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo), an enzyme from the Krebs cycle, physically associates with the electron transport chain Complex III2IV2 (CIII2CIV2) supercomplex. Analysis of the Mqo:CIII2CIV2 interaction shows that CIII2CIV2 is necessary for malate-driven, but not NADH- driven, electron transport chain activity and oxygen consumption. Further, the association of Mqo with CIII2CIV2 enables electron transfer from malate to CIII2CIV2 with millisecond kinetics. Together, these findings indicate a connection between the Krebs cycle and respiration that directs electrons along a single branch of the mycobacterial electron transport chain.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

However, this type of catalysis would be even more thriving if customizable and stable protein scaffolds would be readily available. Such highly stable protein scaffolds could act as asymmetric reaction chambers in catalyzing a wide range of reactions. In this study, we are detailing the design and experimental characterization of computationally designed de novo proteins with a non-natural fold, which act as biocatalysts. The initial design and several variants of it, catalyze the aldol condensation and retro-aldol reaction. All designs form a helical barrel structure comprised of six antiparallel straight helices connected by five loops, resulting in an open channel with two accessible cavities. The designs exhibit high thermal stability and an excellent overall fit between measured and calculated scattering profiles from small-angle x-ray scattering experiments. An experimentally determined crystal structure of a surface redesigned variant shows close to perfect agreement to the design model. To highlight the versatility and mutational tolerance of this fold, we rationally designed variants in which the active site is placed at different positions throughout the central channel of the original design. Finally, we showcase that the initial design as well as variants exhibit significant aldolase/retro-aldolase activity in whole cell biotransformations, making them the first de novo biocatalysts to be tested in this form. With a tolerance of up to 20% of organic solvent, these designs hold promise for further utilization and optimization in the field of white biotechnology.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

During development migrating mesenchymal cells form tissues that shape some of the body's organs. We have developed a powerful model for examining this, exploring how Drosophila testis nascent myotubes migrate onto the testis during pupal development, forming the muscles that ensheath it and also creating its characteristic spiral shape. To define genes that regulate this process, we have carried out RNAseq to define the genes expressed in myotubes during migration. Using this dataset, we curated a list of 131 ligands, receptors and cytoskeletal regulators, including all Rho-family GTPase GAPs and GEFs, as candidates. We then used the GAL4/UAS system to express 279 shRNAs targeting these genes, using the muscle specific driver dMef2>GAL4, and examined the adult testis. We identified 29 genes with diverse roles in testis morphogenesis. Some have phenotypes consistent with defects in collective cell migration, while others alter testis shape in different ways, revealing some of the underlying logic of testis morphogenesis. We followed up one of these genes in more detail--that encoding the Rho-family GEF dPix. dPix knockdown leads to a drastic reduction in migration and a substantial loss of muscle coverage. Our data suggest different isoforms of dPix play distinct roles in this process, reveal a role for its protein partner Git. We also explore whether cdc42 activity regulation or cell adhesion are among the dPix mechanisms of action. Together, our RNAseq dataset and genetic analysis will provide an important resource forthe community to explore cell migration and organ morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

The underlying neural mechanisms are attributed theoretically to effects of variant connective tissue on the precision of interoceptive representations contributing to emotions.

MethodsWe used functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) to quantify regional brain responses to emotional stimuli (facial expressions) in patients with generalised anxiety disorder (N=30) and a non-anxious comparison group (N=33). All participants were assessed for joint laxity and were classified (using Brighton Criteria) for the presence and absence of Hypermobility Syndrome (HMS: now considered Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder).

ResultsHMS participants showed attenuated neural reactivity to emotional faces in specific frontal (inferior frontal gyrus, pre-supplementary motor area), midline (anterior mid and posterior cingulate cortices), and parietal (precuneus and supramarginal gyrus) regions. Notably, interaction between HMS and anxiety was expressed in reactivity of left amygdala (a region implicated in threat processing) and mid insula (primary interoceptive cortex) where activity was amplified in HMS patients with generalised anxiety disorder. Severity of hypermobility in anxious, compared to non-anxious, individuals correlated with activity within anterior insula (implicated as the neural substrate linking anxious feelings to physiological state). Amygdala-precuneus functional connectivity was stronger in HMS, compared to non-HMS, participants.

ConclusionsThe predisposition to anxiety in people with variant connective tissue reflects dynamic interactions between neural centres processing threat (amygdala) and representing bodily state (insular and parietal cortices). Correspondingly, interventions to regulate of amygdala reactivity while enhancing interoceptive precision may have therapeutic benefit for symptomatic hypermobile individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

Typically, core microbiomes are defined as the microbial taxa, genes, or functions shared by a threshold number of microbiome samples from a particular type of habitat (e.g., a particular type of host or a particular type of environment/ecosystem). In defining the core microbiome, the goal is to capture the portion of the microbial community that is conserved across samples from the focal habitat. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing methods to better characterize core microbiomes. As a result, numerous occurrence- and abundance-based measures have been defined. However, none have included phylogenetically aware metrics for analyzing core microbiomes.

ResultsIn this paper, we develop the concept of the  core community phylogeny - a phylogeny where branches are selected based on their presence in multiple samples from a single type of habitat. We then use the core community phylogeny to define phylogenetic metrics for the diversity of core microbiomes from a single type of habitat, for turnover between core microbiomes from two different types of habitat, and for shared diversity across core microbiomes from two or more different types of habitat. As compared to non-phylogenetic metrics, our phylogenetic metrics show greater consistency across taxonomic rank and less sensitivity to strain variation across microbiome samples. Thus, our metrics address key challenges in the interpretation of core microbiomes.

ConclusionsWe provide a phylogenetic framework for characterizing and comparing core microbiomes. Importantly, the methods that we propose allows integration of microbiome properties across taxonomic rank. Ultimately, this will provide both a more consistent picture of the core microbiome, as well as novel biological insight into the conserved components of microbial communities.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and superresolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. We applied ExIGS to fibroblast cells derived from an individual with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome to characterize how variation in nuclear morphology affects spatial chromatin organization. Using this data, we discovered that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant euchromatin repression that may erode cell identity. Further, we show that lamin abnormalities heterogeneously increase the repressive environment of the nucleus in tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform for connecting nuclear abnormalities to changes in gene regulation across disease contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

While molecular docking has long been employed for epitope identification, it requires substantial expertise. With the advent of AI driven tools, epitope identification has become more accessible to a broader community increasing the risk of models misinterpretation. In this study, we critically evaluate the nanobody epitope prediction performance of two leading models: AlphaFold3 and AlphaFold2-Multimer (v.2.3.2), highlighting their strengths and limitations. Our analysis revealed that the overall success rate remains below 50% for both tools, with AlphaFold3 achieving a modest overall improvement. Interestingly, a significant improvement in the performance of AlphaFold3 was observed within a specific nanobody class. To address this discrepancy, we explored factors influencing epitope identification, demonstrating that accuracy heavily depends on CDR3 characteristics, such as its 3D spatial conformation and length, which drive binding interactions with the antigen. Additionally, we assessed the robustness of the confidence metrics of AlphaFold3, highlighting their potential for broader applications. Finally, we evaluated different strategies aimed at improving prediction success rate. This study can be extended to assess the accuracy of emerging deep learning models adopting a similar approach to AlphaFold3.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

A key feature of the transition to MASH involves oxidative stress resulting from defects in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we show that pathological alterations in the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) directly instigate electron transfer inefficiency to promote oxidative stress. Specifically, cardiolipin (CL) was downregulated across four mouse models of MASLD. Hepatocyte-specific CL synthase knockout (CLS-LKO) led to spontaneous MASH with elevated mitochondrial electron leak. Loss of CL interfered with the ability of coenzyme Q (CoQ) to transfer electrons, promoting leak primarily at sites IIF and IIIQ0. Data from human liver biopsies revealed a highly robust correlation between mitochondrial CL and CoQ, co-downregulated with MASH. Thus, reduction in mitochondrial CL promotes oxidative stress and contributes to pathogenesis of MASH.

Because interareal alpha synchrony is thought to facilitate long-range communication in healthy brains, coherence measures of resting-state alpha oscillations may provide insights into a patients capacity for higher-order cognition beyond channel-wise estimates of alpha power. In multi-channel EEG, global coherence methods may be used to augment standard spectral analysis methods by both estimating the strength and identifying the structure of coherent oscillatory networks. We performed global coherence analysis in 95 separate clinical EEG recordings (28 healthy controls and 33 patients with acute or chronic DoC, 25 of whom returned for follow-up) collected between two academic medical centers. We found that posterior alpha coherence is associated with recovery of higher-level cognition. We developed a measure of network organization, based on the distance between eigenvectors of the alpha cross-spectral matrix, that detects recovery of posterior alpha networks. In patients who have emerged from a minimally conscious state, we showed that coherence-based alpha networks are reconfigured prior to restoration of alpha power to resemble those seen in healthy controls. This alpha network measure performs well in classifying recovery from DoC (AUC = 0.78) compared to common representations of functional connectivity using the weighted phase lag index (AUC = 0.50 - 0.57). Lastly, we observed that activity within these alpha networks is suppressed during positive responses to task-based EEG command-following paradigms, supporting the potential utility of this biomarker to detect covert cognition. Our findings suggest that restored alpha networks may represent a sensitive early signature of cognitive recovery in patients with DoC. Therefore, network detection methods may augment the utility of EEG assessments for DoC.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

In vitro, loss of killifish cGAS or STING mitigated DNA damage-induced senescence in cultured fibroblasts. In vivo, cGAS knockout unexpectedly led to low-grade inflammation. It also attenuated changes in gene expression in response to DNA damage in young animals, and age-related changes in the old, suggesting dampening of senescence and aging. Necroscopy indicated that tissue pathology appeared milder overall in both mutants, though some tissues showed enhanced sterile macrophage infiltration. Despite an attenuated aging signature, however, longevity was not significantly different from wild type. Our findings reveal a potential tradeoff, where inhibiting the cGAS/STING pathway alleviates age-related signatures, but increases sterile inflammation, offsetting beneficial effects on lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Here, we simulated pathogen evolution combining within-host replication and between-host transmission. We found that, under certain conditions, chronic infections can lead to SARS-CoV-2-like bursts of mutations even without epistasis. Chronic infections can also increase the global evolutionary rate of a pathogen even in the absence of clear mutational bursts.

Here, we report that the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora enters apple leaves through naturally-occurring wounds caused by the abscission of trichomes during the course of leaf development. Through macroscopic and microscopic observations, we depicted a clear invasion path for E. amylovora cells, from epiphytic growth on glandular trichomes (GT) and non-glandular trichomes (NT), to entry through wounds caused by abscised trichomes, into the epithem, and subsequent spread through xylem. We further observed that GT and NT undergo an abscission process, and that the amount of naturally-occurring wounds during abscission is associated with the increase in E. amylovora population. Key genes important for the colonization of GT and NT were identified. Contribution of the type III secretion system and amylovoran biosynthesis during GT colonization was validated.

How to identify distinct structural states within these volume ensembles and quantify their relative occupancies remain open questions. Here, we present an approach to inferring variable regions directly from a volume ensemble based on the statistical co-occupancy of voxels, as well as a 3D-convolutional neural network that predicts binarization thresholds for volumes in an unbiased and automated manner. We show that these tools recapitulate known heterogeneity in a variety of simulated and real cryo-EM datasets, and highlight how integrating these tools with existing data processing pipelines enables improved particle curation and the construction of quantitative conformational landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures, including the full-length BTN3A1-BTN3A2-BTN2A1 complex stabilized by the pAg HMBPP and an HMBPP-primed BTN multimer complex engaged with the V{gamma}9V{delta}2 TCR. The HMBPP-primed BTN3A1-BTN3A2-BTN2A1 complex confirms that this pAg bridges the intracellular B30.2 domains of BTN3A1 and BTN2A1, while also revealing an association of the ectodomains of BTN3A2 and BTN2A1. Upon TCR engagement, the TCR undergoes a substantial conformational change and BTN3A2-BTN2A1 ectodomain interaction dissociates, allowing BTN2A1 to bind to the lateral surface of the V{gamma}9 chain, while BTN3A2 binds to the apical surface of the V{delta}2 chain. Beyond demonstrating that BTN3A2 as a bona fide TCR ligand, this dissociation/binding sequence suggests a ""pliers-like gripping"" mechanism for TCR activation. We also obtained cryo-EM structures of BTN proteins in complex with functional antibodies, further elucidating the overall V{gamma}9V{delta}2 T cell activation process. Thus, our structural insights into how BTN proteins sense antigens and drive TCR activation lay the groundwork for developing targeted {gamma}{delta} T cell immunotherapies.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Thus, characteristic emergent rules of collective migration can arise from cell-cell contacts locally tweaking architecture - orchestrating self-regulation during development, wound healing, and cancer progression. The new Drosophila testis-nascent-myotube-system allows dissection of contact-dependent migration in vivo at high resolution. Here, we describe a process driving gap-closure during migration: Contact-mesenchymalization via the axon guidance factor Plexin A. This is crucial for testis myotubes to migrate as a continuous sheet, allowing normal sculpting-morphogenesis. Cells must stay filopodial and dynamically ECM-tethered near cell-cell contacts to spread while collectively moving. Our data suggest Semaphorin 1B acts as a Plexin A antagonist, fine-tuning activation. Our data reveal a contact-dependent mechanism to maintain sheet-integrity during migration, driving organ-morphogenesis using a highly conserved pathway. This is relevant for understanding mesenchymal organ-sculpting and gap-closure in migratory contexts like angiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

We i) used chemically modified gRNAs to allow more penetrant loss-of-function phenotypes, ii) improved nuclear RNA-targeting, and iii) compared different computational models and determined the most accurate to predict gRNA activity in vivo.

They are formed by two or more alpha helices that wind around a central axis to form a buried hydrophobic core. Various forms of coiled-coil bundles have been reported, each characterized by the number, orientation, and degree of winding of the constituent helices. This variability is underpinned by short sequence repeats that form coiled coils and whose properties determine both their overall topology and the local geometry of the hydrophobic core. The strikingly repetitive sequence has enabled the development of accurate sequence-based coiled-coil prediction methods; however, the modeling of coiled-coil domains remains a challenging task. In this work, we evaluated the accuracy of AlphaFold2 in modeling coiled-coil domains, both in modeling local geometry and in predicting global topological properties.

Stable EMT intermediate states play a particularly important role in cell state plasticity and confer metastatic potential. To explore the dynamics of EMT and identify marker genes of highly metastatic intermediate cells, we analyzed EMT across multiple tumor types and stimuli via mathematical modeling with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. We identified pan-cancer genes consistently expressed or upregulated in EMT intermediate states, most of which were not previously annotated as markers of EMT. Using Bayesian parameter inference, we fit a simple mathematical model to scRNA-seq data, revealing tumor-specific transition rates. This mathematical model offers a framework to quantify EMT progression. A consensus analysis of differential intermediate expression, regulation, and model-derived dynamics identified marker genes associated with persistence of the intermediate EMT state. SFN and NRG1 emerged as genes with the strongest evidence for their role influencing intermediate EMT dynamics. Through analysis of an independent cell line, we verified the role of SFN as a marker intermediate EMT transition. Modeling and inference of genes associated with EMT dynamics offer means to find biomarkers and to identify therapeutic approaches to harness or reverse tumor-promoting cell state transitions driven by EMT.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

We use bacterial culture collections derived from the two model species Arabidopsis thaliana (At) and Lotus japonicus (Lj) to design synthetic communities (SynComs) and test their protective function upon exposure of At Col-0 to the detrimental root-colonizing Pseudomonas isolate R401. Lj-derived SynComs were fully protective, whereas At-derived SynComs displayed full protective activity only towards a R401 mutant impaired in the production of inhibitory exometabolites. The protective phenotypes were associated with a reduced titer of the R401 opportunistic pathogen. In vitro antagonist assays, in planta and in vitro bacterial community profiling, as well as strain-swapping and strain-dropout experiments revealed that competition among commensal Pseudomonas strains and R401 determines the success of the opportunist, independent of the original host or the phylogeny of the commensals. Furthermore, we determine the carbon utilization potential of these isolates, which may explain the competition with the detrimental strain and the role of host-secreted compounds. Our results provide evidence that intra-genus interactions within SynComs modulate plant health and disease, and that an individual beneficial strain can be sufficient to outcompete an opportunistic relative.

Confidently identifying lipids in samples is a prerequisite for understanding the multiple functions lipids fulfill in health and disease. However, the accurate identification of molecular lipid species based on tandem mass spectrometry data is still a key challenge in lipidomics. Most current approaches rely on using a custom pipeline to process and match the measured spectra against an in-house spectra reference library, which hinders the comparability of results. To address this challenge, a transformer model called LipiDetective was developed and trained on a dataset composed of reference spectra measured from lipid standards, spectra from databases, and published experiments, utilizing both shotgun as well as liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. LipiDetective demonstrates, for the first time, that artificial neural networks can learn the characteristic lipid fragmentation patterns to automatically and accurately annotate molecular lipids species in tandem mass spectra independently of the experimental setup. The model can even correctly predict lipid species for which it has never seen a spectrum before as it is able to generalize the learned lipid fragmentation patterns. Analysis of the integrated gradients reveals that LipiDetective focuses on relevant peaks that can be matched to known fragments and are thus humanly interpretable. Therefore, LipiDetective has the potential to be a valuable tool to aid in the lipid identification process and support the comparability of results from different sources. Aside from Lipidetective as a ""ready-to-use"" application, this work primarily offers a deeper understanding of how the model functions and how future deep learning models for lipid identification in mass spectra could be improved.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

To optimize the use of our antifungal arsenal, we need rapid detection and monitoring tools that rely on high-quality AMR mutation data. Here, we performed a thorough manual curation of published AMR mutations in fungal pathogens to produce the FungAMR reference dataset. A total of 462 papers were curated, leading to 54,666 mutation entries all classified with the degree of evidence that supports their role in resistance. FungAMR covers 92 species, 202 genes and 184 drugs. We combined variant effect predictors with FungAMR resistance mutations and showed that these tools could be used to help predict the potential impact of mutations on AMR. Additionally, a comparative analysis among species revealed a high level of convergence in the molecular basis of resistance, revealing some potentially universal resistance mutations. The analysis also showed that a significant number of resistance mutations lead to cross-resistance within antifungals of a class, as well as between classes for certain mutated genes. The acquisition of fungal resistance in the clinic and the field is an urging concern. Finally, we provide a computational tool, ChroQueTas, that leverages FungAMR to screen fungal genomes for AMR mutations. These resources are anticipated to have great utility for researchers in the fight against antifungal resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

However, little is known about how this drug alters large-scale brain activity. We collected naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) data of 29 healthy individuals before and after inhaling a high dose (12mg) of vaporised synthetic 5-MeO-DMT. We replicate work from rodents showing amplified low-frequency oscillations, but extend these findings with novel tools for characterising the organisation and dynamics of complex low-frequency spatiotemporal fields of neural activity. We find that 5-MeO-DMT radically reorganises low-frequency flows of neural activity, causing them to become incoherent, heterogeneous, viscous, fleeting, nonrecurring, and to cease their typical travelling forwards and backwards across the cortex compared to resting state. Further, we find a consequence of this reorganisation in broadband activity, which exhibits slower, more stable, low-dimensional behaviour, with increased energy barriers to rapid global shifts. These findings provide the first detailed empirical account of how 5-MeO-DMT sculpts human brain dynamics, revealing a novel set of cortical slow wave behaviours, with significant implications for extant neuroscientific models of serotonergic psychedelics.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

A typical human cell expresses over 200 different SLCs, yet their collective influence on cell phenotypes is not well understood due to overlapping substrate specificities and expression patterns. To address this, we performed systematic pairwise gene double knockouts using CRISPR-Cas12a and -Cas9 in human colon carcinoma cells. A total of 1,088,605 guide combinations were used to interrogate 35,421 SLC-SLC and SLC-enzyme double knockout combinations across multiple growth conditions, uncovering 1,236 genetic interactions with a growth phenotype. Further exploration of an interaction between the mitochondrial citrate/malate exchanger SLC25A1 and the zinc transporter SLC39A1 revealed an unexpected role for SLC39A1 in metabolic reprogramming and anti-apoptotic signaling.

Nonetheless, these are often examined at the individual level, while societal-environmental exposures and their association with anxiety disorders are under-researched, especially in the Israeli context. This study leverages 19 years of longitudinal data from a large healthcare organization to examine the impact of national security instability on short-term anxiolytic purchases in Israel.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records of over 1.1 million individuals from 2006 to 2024, examining rates of first-time and renewed use of anxiolytic medications of the benzodiazepines group during periods of armed conflict, including military operations and wars. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, socioreligious sector, residence and previous psychiatric treatment.

ResultsThe risk for first purchase of an anxiety-relief short terms medication during military operations was 28% higher (HR 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21-1.34) compared to periods of relative national stability, after adjustments, and 44% higher during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27-1.62). The events of October 7th were the most significant armed conflict increasing the risk for anxiety-related reaction necessitating treatment throughout the 19-years follow-up, with individuals at 317% increased risk for treatment initiation compared to periods of relative national stability (HR 4.17, 95% CI 3.97-4.38). Alongside a baseline increased risk for initiating anti-anxiety treatment, women experienced an additional elevated risk for anxiolytic therapy during times of national security threats, with 26% additional increased risk during military operations and an 81% increased risk following the events of October 7th. Residents of northern Israel had an increased risk of purchasing anxiolytics during the Second Lebanon War (HR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.12-1.72), while during military operations it was the residents of southern Israel who faced an increased risk for anxiolytic usage, with an HR of 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05-1.33). Conversely, the residential region did not significantly influence anti-anxiety treatment patterns following October 7th among residents of southern or northern Israel, compared to individuals living in central Israel, indicating a broader national impact beyond regional differences.

ConclusionsNational armed conflicts significantly influence anxiolytic medication use in Israel, with the October 7th war showing the most pronounced effect. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive mental health interventions during times of national crisis, focusing on both short-term relief and long-term mental health support to prevent dependency and improve mental health outcomes in the wake of national crises.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

These sequences, known as spacers, are inserted into the CRISPR locus by the Cas1-Cas2 integrase complex and mediate sequence- specific immunity in prokaryotes. Spacer acquisition has been used to develop unique biotechnological applications such as the immunization of industrially relevant bacteria against bacteriophage infection and the recording of biological signals into stable genetic information. These technologies, however, are constrained by the low efficiency of the spacer acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, we developed a genetic system that combined deep mutational scanning (DMS) of cas genes from the Streptococcus pyogenes type II-A CRISPR- Cas system with a method that selects bacteria that acquire new spacers. This procedure enabled the identification of cas mutations that support up to a sevenfold increase in the levels of spacer acquisition and a significant enhancement of immunity against phage infection. In addition, our analysis revealed key interactions at the Cas1-Cas2 interface critical for spacer integration. Our findings provide insights into the molecular determinants of spacer acquisition and offer a platform to improve CRISPR-Cas-based applications.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Although proposed decades ago, experimental evidence of a titration-based control mechanism is still lacking. Here, we first identified a conserved high-density region of binding motifs near the origin of replication, an advantageous trait for titration of DnaA. We then investigated the mobility of DnaA by single-particle tracking microscopy in wild-type and deletion mutants E. coli strains, while monitoring cellular size and DNA content. Our results indicate that the chromosome of E. coli controls the free amount of DnaA in a growth rate-dependent fashion. Finally, we provide insights on the relevance of DnaA titration in stabilising DNA replication by preventing re-initiation events during slow growth.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Altogether, we identified 133 probands with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in RNU4-2 and 15 individuals with de novo and/or recurrent variants in constrained regions of RNU5B-1, one of five genes encoding U5. These variants cluster in evolutionarily conserved regions of U4 and U5 essential for splicing.

Phaseable variants associated with severe phenotypes occurred on the maternal allele. Individuals with RNU4-2 variants show specific defects in alternative 5 splice site usage, correlating with variant location and clinical severity. Additionally, we report an episignature associated with severe ReNU syndrome.

However, the biocultural origins of fermentation practices and microbes have largely been replaced by industrial processes. Here, we consider a historical fermentation originating from Turkey and Bulgaria - ant yogurt. We revisit the traditional practices and modern gastronomic applications that use red wood ants (Formica rufa group) to initiate milk fermentation. Subsequently, we characterize the ants and experimental ant-derived yogurts. We uncover that the ant holobiont, which consists of the ants and their microbes, contributes key acids and enzymes to fermentation. Metabarcoding and culturing revealed that lactic and acetic acid bacteria, including species related to those in conventional yogurt and sourdough, originate from the live ants and proliferate in the milk. The ants and bacteria consequently introduce formic, lactic, and acetic acid, advantageous for yogurt acidification and coagulation. Last, proteases with the potential to act on casein and alter yogurt texture are produced by the ants and bacteria. The ant holobiont thus facilitates fermentation akin to the microbial consortia in other ferments. Our findings highlight the value of integrating traditional, gastronomic, and biological frameworks to uncover the origins and applications of microbes for fermented foods.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

We developed a high-throughput massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that, in a single experiment, measures the half-life of tens of thousands of unique mRNA sequences containing designed 3 UTRs. Over multiple design-build-test iterations, we have accumulated 180,000 unique measurements of mRNA stability covering unique genomic and synthetic 3 UTRs, representing the largest such dataset of sequences. We trained highly-accurate machine learning models to map from 3 UTR sequence to mRNA stability, and used them to guide the design of synthetic 3 UTRs that increase mRNA stability in cell lines. Finally, we validated the function of several ML-designed 3 UTRs in mouse models, resulting in up to 2-fold more protein production over time and 30-100-fold higher protein output at later time points compared to a commonly used benchmark.

Lactate-derived histone lactylation has recently been identified as an important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of gene expression across various biological processes. In this study, we report an increase in global histone lactylation and H3K18Lac levels in the mesenchyme and osteoblasts of the zebrafish caudal fin, during the early stages of regeneration. Our findings demonstrate that this epigenetic modification is functionally regulated by increased lactate levels, while inhibition of glycolysis and lactate production significantly reduces histone lactylation. These results suggest that metabolic reprogramming, in response to caudal fin injury, regulates histone lactylation, potentially modulating gene expression essential for cell plasticity and proliferation. This study expands our understanding of how metabolic-epigenetic interactions influence regenerative processes, providing valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue repair.

Summary statementLactate-derived histone lactylation plays a role in the early stages of zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, coupling metabolic adaptation with tissue repair mechanisms, through epigenetic regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

This isolation, combined with substantial Denisovan ancestry, contributes to the unique genetic makeup of the Papua New Guinean population. Previous research suggested the possibility of admixture with an early diverged modern human population, but the extent of this contribution remains debated. This study re-examines the demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population using newly published samples and advanced analytical methods. Our findings demonstrate that the observed shifts in relative cross coalescent rate curves are unlikely to result from technical artefacts or contributions from an earlier out of Africa population. Instead, they are likely due to a significant bottleneck and slower population growth rate within the Papua New Guinean population. Our analysis positions the Papua New Guinean population as a sister group to other Asian populations, challenging the notion of Papua New Guinean as an outgroup to both European and Asian populations. This study provides new insights into the complex demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population and underscores the importance of considering population-specific demographic events in interpreting relative cross coalescent rate curves.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Our study investigated whether these fungi have potential for abuse and pose a risk to public health.

MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study following the STROBE Initiative guidelines, using data from the Sistema de Agravos de Notificacao (SINAN) to obtain a representative sample of adverse events reported between 2007 and 2022. Participants were divided into three groups: drug abuse, psilocybin mushrooms, and unknown mushrooms. The clinical outcomes evaluated were non-hospitalization, hospitalization, and death. To analyze associations between categorical variables, we applied the Chi-square test ({chi}{superscript 2}).

ResultsDuring the study period, 112,451 individuals sought medical attention due to adverse events associated with drug abuse. Men (n = 79.514; 70.7%), whites (n = 37.565; 33.4%), and the 26-35 age group (n = 29.163; 25.9%) were the most well-represented (p < 0.001). Alcohol (n = 71.824; 49.2%) (p < 0.001) was the primary toxic agent. Hospitalization and mortality rates in the drug abuse group were 19.5% (n = 21,923) and 1.8% (n = 2035), respectively. Psilocybin mushroom group included 13 adverse events, which represents 0.02% of all hospitalizations (n = 6; 46.2%). Unknown mushroom group accounted for 51 adverse events, comprising 0.04% of hospitalizations (n = 12; 23.5%). There were no fatalities in either the psilocybin or unknown mushroom groups. Most hospitalizations involved alcohol (45.0%) and deaths represented mainly by cocaine (33.3%).

ConclusionWhile our findings suggest that psilocybin mushrooms present a low-risk profile of adverse events, underreporting is a possibility. Given the increasing public interest in psilocybin mushrooms, this study underscores the importance of evidence-based regulatory discussions to prevent arbitrary arrests and ensure safe access to psilocybin for both clinical and ceremonial purposes.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

This complex phenomenon is driven by precise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression across many cells, resulting in the emergence of highly organized tissue structures. While similar emergent behavior is well understood in other fields, such as statistical mechanics, the regulation of gene expression in development remains less clear, particularly regarding how molecular-level gene interactions lead to the large-scale patterns observed in embryos. In this study, we present a modeling framework that bridges the gap between molecular gene regulation and tissue-level embryonic patterning. Beginning with basic chemical reaction models of transcription at the single-gene level, we progress to model gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that mediate specific cellular functions. We then introduce phenomenological models of pattern formation, including the French Flag and Temporal Patterning/Speed Regulation models, and integrate them with molecular/GRN realizations. To facilitate understanding and application of our models, we accompany our mathematical framework with computer simulations, providing intuitive and simple code for each model. A key feature of our framework is the explicit articulation of underlying assumptions at each level of the model, from transcriptional regulation to tissue patterning. By making these assumptions clear, we provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical work to critically examine and challenge them, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of gene regulatory models in developmental biology. As a case study, we explore how different strategies for integrating enhancer activity affect the robustness and evolvability of gene expression patterns in embryonic development. Our simulations suggest that a two-step regulation strategy, enhancer activation followed by competitive integration at the promoter, ensures more standardized integration of new enhancers into developmental GRNs, highlighting the adaptability of eukaryotic transcription. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms underlying embryonic patterning, offering a framework for future experimental and theoretical investigations.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

We systematically analyzed the developmental role of an expanded TTR family of proteins, structurally analogous to mammalian thyroid hormone-transporting Transthyretin, and identified three paralogous proteins, TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17, differentially expressed in somatic cells of the gonads and secreted around gametes in C. elegans. Simultaneous inactivation of TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17 leads to a rapid reduction in reproductive capacity in middle age. While oocyte and sperm production remain unaffected in the triple mutants, late-onset infertility results from stalled ovulation. Mechanistically, the absence of TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17 causes sperm to prematurely deplete the cytoplasmic pool of major sperm protein (MSP), released via non-conventional vesicle budding as a signal for ovulation. We propose that the somatic gonads play a central role in maintaining sperm integrity post-production and determining the duration of the reproductive age.

In this study, by analyzing a new individual (1.25x) and published Republican samples, we propose a novel perspective for the presence of Near Eastern ancestry in the Imperial gene pool. In our scenario, the spread of this genetic ancestry took place during the late Republican period, predating the onset of the Empire by [~]200 years. The diffusion of this ancestry may have occurred due to early East-to-West movements, since Eastern Mediterranean regions were already under Roman political influence during the Republic, or even as a result of migration from Southern Italy where Greeks and Phoenicians settled.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

To address these limitations we developed a soft, composite yield-stress extracellular matrix that supports optimal organoid morphogenesis following freeform 3D bioprinting of cell slurries at tissue-like densities. The material is designed with two temperature regimes: at 4 {degrees}C it exhibits reversible yield-stress behavior to support long printing times without compromising cell viability. When transferred to cell culture at 37 {degrees}C, the material cross-links and exhibits similar viscoelasticity and plasticity to basement membrane extracts such as Matrigel. We first characterize the rheological properties of MAGIC matrices that optimize organoid morphogenesis, including low stiffness and high stress relaxation. Next, we combine this material with a custom piezoelectric printhead that allows more reproducible and robust self-organization from uniform and spatially organized tissue ""seeds."" We apply MAGIC matrix bioprinting for high-throughput generation of intestinal, mammary, vascular, salivary gland, and brain organoid arrays that are structurally similar to those grown in pure Matrigel, but exhibit dramatically improved homogeneity in organoid size, shape, maturation time, and efficiency of morphogenesis. The flexibility of this method and material enabled fabrication of fully 3D microphysiological systems, including perfusable organoid tubes that experience cyclic 3D strain in response to pressurization. Furthermore, the reproducibility of organoid structure increased the statistical power of a drug response assay by up to 8 orders-of-magnitude for a given number of comparisons. Combined, these advances lay the foundation for the efficient fabrication of complex tissue morphologies by canalizing their self-organization in both space and time.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Although uropathogenesis has been studied extensively in the context of macromolecular interactions, the degree to which metabolism may contribute to infection is unclear. Currently, most of what is known about the metabolic capacity of uropathogens has been derived from genomics, genetic knockout studies or transcriptomic analyses. However, there are currently very little empirical data on the metabolic activity of uropathogens when grown in urine. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic survey of the metabolic activities of eight of the most common uropathogenic bacterial species that collectively represent 99% of uncomplicated UTIs. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses of human urine cultures revealed that uropathogens have four distinct metabolic clades. We generalized these clades as serine consumers (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis), glutamine consumers (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), amino acid abstainers (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), and amino acid minimalists (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus). These metabolic classifications can be further subdivided on a species-to-species level. This survey provides a framework to understanding the metabolic activity of the diverse range of uropathogens and how these species use divergent metabolic strategies to occupy the same niche.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

ObjectiveThis SLR summarizes the evidence across studies among predominately adults that report an adjusted measure of association for the relationship between vaccination and PCC, by timing of vaccination relative to infection or PCC-onset and across different study characteristics.

Evidence reviewA comprehensive search strategy was developed within the OVID platform across EMBASE, MEDLINE(R) and Evidence-Based Medicine reviews, and supplemented with WHO COVID library and Google Scholar(R) searches, to collate evidence on vaccination and PCC published or posted as pre-prints between January 1st, 2020 and July 18th, 2023. JBI Critical Appraisal Checklists were used to assess each studys risk of bias.

FindingsThis review included 97 studies and synthesized results from 56 studies with low risk of bias that reported adjusted measures for the association between vaccination and PCC. Overall, 77% of pre-infection adjusted VE (aVE) estimates (vs. unvaccinated) were statistically significant (range: 7%-95%), 80% of estimates reflecting a mix of those vaccinated before and after infection were statistically significant (range: 62%-73%), one of five estimates reflecting vaccination after PCC onset was statistically significant (aVE=41%), 43% of post-infection vaccination estimates were statistically significant (two were protective [range: 28%-40%] and one was not [aVE=-47%]), and 46% of estimates not specifying vaccination timing were statistically significant (23 were protective [range: 29%-75%] and one was not [aVE=-132%]). Statistically significant pre-infection aVE estimates were slightly higher for mRNA (range: 14%-84%) than non-mRNA vaccines (range: 16%-38%) and aVE ranges during (4 studies; range: 10%-70%) and before Omicron predominance (10 studies; range: 7%-50%) overlapped. Pre-infection vaccination was protective regardless of vaccine type, number of doses received, PCC definition, predominant variant, and severity of acute infections included.

Conclusions and RelevanceCollectively our findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccination received prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection reduces the subsequent risk of developing PCC regardless of the predominant variant circulating.

FindingsCOVID-19 vaccination before SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to reduce the risk of PCC (vs. unvaccinated). Compared with other COVID-19 vaccine types, mRNA vaccines seemed to offer greater protection, and a dose response was observed for mRNA vaccines.

Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

However, many eukaryotic viruses, including amoeba-infecting mimiviruses, have codon usage that is largely deviated from that of their host, despite using the host machinery for translation. This raises the question of how these viruses cope with the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand. Here we show that Acanthamoeba castellanii mimivirus generates a subcellular area in the host cells to translate virus mRNAs. A combination of genome-wide ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing showed that ribosomes traversed along viral mRNAs with fewer pausing events than were observed on amoeba mRNAs. Frequently used codons in viral mRNAs had higher tRNA accessibility than the same type of codons in amoeba mRNAs. tRNA sequencing showed that the tRNA pool was not greatly altered during the infection even though the virus encodes tRNA genes. Instead, by in situ labelling, we found that viral mRNAs and newly synthesized proteins were localized at the periphery region of the viral factory, likely creating a unique environment to facilitate viral translation. Our data provide a perspective on how local translation assists the virus in overcoming the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Exporting this measure to the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and UK Biobank neuroimaging datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted participants cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Underscoring close links between longitudinal aging of the body and brain, faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases, and mortality in older adults. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI followed the expected socioeconomic health gradient. When compared to brain age gap, an existing MRI aging biomarker, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes.

However, converging recent evidence in rodent models as well as human neuroimaging suggests that the hippocampus may be involved in a wider range of memory domains, including motor sequence learning (MSL). Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients during a MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30-second training blocks interspersed with 30-second rest ( offline) periods. We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked learning behaviour, both across blocks and across participants. These results suggest that hippocampal ripples during offline periods play a functional role in motor sequence learning and that the hippocampus may be involved in offline learning beyond episodic memory.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

These rich datasets revealed positional niches and cellular heterogeneity along the proximal-distal axis, including the identification of a unique population of TP63+ basal cells, the primary stem cell of the airway, marked by expression of LGR5 and LGR6. Analysis of the LGR5+ basal cell niche and functional experiments with primary organoid models suggest a tonic level of WNT pathway activity in LGR5+ basal cells that is potentiated by mesenchyme-derived R-SPONDIN. We found that basal cell self-renewal is enhanced by WNT activity, suggesting that the WNT pathway plays a previously unappreciated but critical role in airway stem cell maintenance during human development.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis.

In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728770880001

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

While several software tools are available for this task, ranging from Python and R libraries to standalone graphical user interfaces, there is lack of a tool that offers fast, automated usage and the production of publication-ready vector images.

Here we present LoVis4u, a command-line tool and Python API designed for highly customizable and fast visualisation of multiple genomic loci. LoVis4u generates vector images in PDF format based on annotation data from GenBank or GFF files. It is capable of visualising entire genomes of bacteriophages as well as plasmids and user-defined regions of longer prokaryotic genomes. Additionally, LoVis4u offers optional data processing steps to identify and highlight accessory and core genes in input sequences.

Availability and ImplementationLoVis4u is implemented in Python3 and runs on Linux and MacOS. The command-line interface covers most practical use cases, while the provided Python API allows usage within a Python program, integration into external tools, and additional customisation. Source code is available at the GitHub page: github.com/art-egorov/lovis4u. Detailed documentation that includes an example-driven guide is available from the software home page: art-egorov.github.io/lovis4u.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Here we develop minimally invasive optical clearing media for fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues. Light scattering is minimized by adding spherical polymers with low osmolarity to the extracellular medium. A clearing medium containing bovine serum albumin (SeeDB-Live) is minimally invasive to live cells, allowing for structural and functional imaging of live tissues, such as spheroids, organoids, acute brain slices, and the mouse brain in vivo. SeeDB-Live minimally affects the electrophysiological properties and sensory responses of neurons. We demonstrate its utility for widefield imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics, such as backpropagating action potentials, in acute brain slices. We also utilize SeeDB-Live for widefield voltage imaging of dozens of dendrites in vivo, demonstrating population dynamics. Thus, SeeDB-Live expands the scale and modalities of fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880001

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880002

Here we present the Protein Design Archive, a website and database of designed proteins. Using the database, we performed systematic analysis that reveals a rapid increase in the number and complexity of designs over time and uncovers biases in their amino-acid usage and secondary structure content. Finally, sequence- and structure-based analysis demonstrates the breadth and novelty of designs within the archive.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880002

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1728770880002

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880002

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1728770880002
