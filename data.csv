Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740348514069

Our method achieves micrometer-scale precision across centimeter-sized areas without clean room infrastructure, using affordable and readily available consumables. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through four biological applications: inducing cytoskeletal protrusions via 1 m-resolution surface topographies; micropatterning to standardize cell and tissue morphology; fabricating multilayer microfluidic devices for confined cell migration studies; imprinting agar chambers for long-time tracking of C. elegans. Our protocol drastically reduces material costs compared to conventional methods and enables design-to-device turnaround within a day. By leveraging open-source microscope control software and existing lab equipment, our workflow lowers the entry barrier to microfabrication, enabling labs to prototype custom solutions for diverse experimental needs while maintaining compatibility with soft lithography and downstream biological assays.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Predictive biomarkers and effective therapies are urgently needed for the clinical management of Long COVID. Neurological manifestations (poor memory, brain fog) are frequent, while neurodamage and neuroinflammatory markers UCHL1, GFAP and NFL were found to be increased in some but not all Long COVID cohorts. However, a direct link between two major Long COVID disease mechanisms, viral persistence and coagulation defects, and CNS damage is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of combined anticoagulant (Asaflow + Clopidogrel) vs. antiviral (Paxlovid) treatment upon clinical outcome and neurodamage markers in Long COVID patients. Using multivariate logistic regression, we found that second-line antiviral treatment is the single best predictor of clinical recovery in a real-world Long COVID cohort (n=106) with long-term (220 person-years) follow-up. Our results support a putative role for viral persistence in Long COVID pathogenesis but also indicate a large therapeutic window for Paxlovid and other antivirals. A rapid decline in neurodamage markers (GFAP/NFL) upon antiviral treatment suggests CNS damage in Long COVID might be therapeutically targeted and should be considered in ongoing and future clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1740348514069

While effective in alleviating immune-mediated conditions, JAK inhibitors can impair antiviral defences by suppressing interferon (IFN) responses, potentially increasing susceptibility to viral infections. This study investigates the pro-viral mechanism of JAK inhibitors, focusing on baricitinib, across various cell lines, retinal organoids, and viral strains, including a recombinant IFN-sensitive Rift Valley fever (rRVFV), influenza A (rIAV), SARS-CoV-2 (rSARSCoV-2) reporter viruses, and wild type adenovirus (AdV). Our findings demonstrate that baricitinib suppresses transcription of IFN-stimulated genes in non-infected cells (ISGs) which is triggered by type I IFNs produced by infected cells, facilitating viral propagation. The pro-viral effects were influenced by viral load, inhibitor concentration, and structural characteristics of the compound. These results underscore the dual effects of JAK inhibitors: reducing inflammation while potentially exacerbating viral infections. Additionally, the findings highlight opportunities to leverage JAK inhibitors for viral research, vaccine production, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Unmodified RNAs stimulate human innate immunity, but RNA modifications suppress this response. mRNA m6A modification is essential for Arabidopsis thaliana viability. However, the molecular basis of the impact of mRNA m6A depletion is poorly understood. Here, we show that disruption of the Arabidopsis mRNA m6A writer complex triggers autoimmunity. Most gene expression changes in m6A writer complex vir-1 mutants grown at 17{degrees}C are explained by defence gene activation and are suppressed at 27{degrees}C, consistent with the established temperature sensitivity of Arabidopsis immunity. Accordingly, we found enhanced pathogen resistance and increased premature cell death in vir-1 mutants at 17{degrees}C but not 27{degrees}C. Global temperature-sensitive mRNA poly(A) tail length changes accompany these phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that autoimmunity is a major phenotype of mRNA m6A writer complex mutants, which has important implications for interpreting this modification's role. Furthermore, we open the broader question of whether unmodified RNA triggers immune signalling in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

While existing models capture aspects like the number of loci, effect sizes, and allele frequencies, they often overlook the molecular processes underlying trait expression. We investigated how gene regulatory networks influence quantitative variation during adaptation by examining the negative autoregulation (NAR) motif in two configurations: K+, with four evolving network components, and K-, with two components. Using forward-time simulations, we tracked populations adapting to a shifted phenotypic optimum under varying genetic architectures. We found that K+ populations maintained rapid adaptation despite low recombination, preserving high genetic variance through positive epistasis and stronger linkage disequilibrium. Under low recombination, K+ populations reached the optimum through diverse molecular configurations, while responses were more uniform under high recombination. In contrast, K- and additive models showed impaired adaptation under low recombination. Our findings demonstrate that network structure fundamentally influences the distribution of variation within the molecular architecture of traits, with certain networks providing unexpected robustness against low recombination rates. This suggests that molecular complexity may confer evolutionary advantages in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

We conducted an integrated analysis that combines electrophysiological and transcriptomic profiling, along with machine learning, of islet cells from T1D donors to investigate the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. Surviving {beta}-cells exhibit altered electrophysiological properties and transcriptomic signatures indicative of increased antigen presentation, metabolic reprogramming, and impaired protein translation. In -cells, we observed hyper-responsiveness and increased exocytosis, which are associated with upregulated immune signaling, disrupted transcription factor localization and lysosome homeostasis, as well as dysregulation of mTORC1 complex signaling. Notably, key genetic risk signals for T1D were enriched in transcripts related to -cell dysfunction, including MHC class I which were closely linked with -cell dysfunction. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of islet cell dysfunction in T1D, highlighting pathways that may be leveraged to preserve residual {beta}-cell function and modulate -cell activity. These findings underscore the complex interplay between immune signaling, metabolic stress, and cellular identity in shaping islet cell phenotypes in T1D.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Computational chemistry and machine learning methods have been developed to investigate these tasks. Despite the encouraging performance, virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization are often studied separately by existing methods, partially because they are performed sequentially in the existing drug discovery pipeline, thereby overlooking their interdependency and complementarity. To address this problem, we propose LigUnity, a foundation model for protein-ligand binding prediction by jointly optimizing virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. In particular, LigUnity learns coarse-grained active/inactive distinction for virtual screening, and fine-grained pocket-specific ligand preference for hit-to-lead optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of LigUnity on eight benchmarks across both tasks. In virtual screening, LigUnity outperforms 24 competing methods with more than 50% improvement on the DUD-E and Dekois 2.0 benchmarks, and shows robust generalization to novel proteins. In hit-to-lead optimization, LigUnity achieves the best performance on split-by-time, split-by-scaffold, and split-by-unit settings, further demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective alternative to free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. We further showcase how LigUnity can be employed in an active learning framework to efficiently identify active ligands for TYK2, a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, yielding over 40% improved prediction performance. Collectively, these comprehensive results establish LigUnity as a versatile foundation model for both virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization, offering broad applicability across the drug discovery pipeline through accurate protein-ligand affinity predictions.

Such mechanisms underlie the epigenetic silencing of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) by prolonged cold. Here, we show a temperature-dependent transition in local chromatin structure at the H3K27me3 nucleation region, from a modality active for transcription to a state that can be Polycomb silenced. In vivo chromatin measurements and coarse-grained simulations at near-atomistic resolution show the active transcription state is characterized by a highly dynamic nucleosome arrangement that exposes the FLC TSS. Cold exposure then changes the chromatin structure by reducing nucleosome dynamics and re-positioning the +1 nucleosome, leading to transcriptional repression. This local chromatin transition partially depends on VRN1, a non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein. Loss of VRN1 results in hyperaccumulation of H2A.Z, more dynamic nucleosomes and an inability to accumulate H2Aub and H3K27me3. Our work highlights how local nucleosome dynamics link to chromatin structure transitions to integrate temperature inputs into epigenetic switching mechanisms in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Here, we introduce a compact, high-speed light sheet fluorescence microscope with isotropic sub-micron resolution optimized for cleared tissue. We introduce three major opto-mechanical innovations using off-the-shelf optics to achieve an isotropic resolution of 850 nm across samples up to 1 cm3 and refractive indices ranging from 1.33 to 1.56. We show that combining an air objective and a meniscus lens achieves an axially swept light sheet with sub-micron diffraction-limited resolution, free of aberrations. The effective field of view is increased 2-fold by correcting the field curvature of the light sheet with a concave mirror in the remote focusing unit. Furthermore, the imaging speed is enhanced 10-fold by adapting the light sheet's motion with a closed-loop feedback, reaching 100 frames per second while maintaining isotropic resolution across the large field of view. Finally, we showcase the performance of our light sheet system for imaging from subcellular up to centimeter scale in cleared mouse cochlea and brain.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

But the extent to which substantial spatial differences exist in ATP concentration in the cell remains incompletely known. It is variously argued that ATP diffuses too quickly for large gradients to be established, or that the high rates of ATP production and use (sources and sinks) can support large gradients even with rapid diffusion - and microscopic models and detailed experiments in different specific cases support both pictures. Here we attempt a mesoscopic investigation, using reaction-diffusion modelling in a simple biophysical picture of the cell to attempt to ask, generally, which conditions cause substantial ATP gradients to emerge within eukaryotic cells. If ATP sources (like mitochondria) or sinks (like the nucleus) are spatially clustered, large fold changes in concentration can exist across the cell; if sources and sinks are more spread then rapid diffusion indeed prevents large gradients being established. This dependence holds in model cells of different sizes, suggesting its generality across cell types.

Traditionally, structure-based virtual screening required experimental protein structures, but advances like AlphaFold2 have begun to overcome this limitation. However, AlphaFold2 does not capture ligand-induced conformational changes (transition from apo to holo forms), limiting its utility for protein-ligand docking. In this study, we evaluate AlphaFold3, which predicts protein-ligand complex structures when both protein and ligand inputs are provided. Using the DUD-E dataset and Uni-Dock, we show that holo structures predicted with ligand inclusion yield higher screening performance than apo structures generated without ligand input. Notably, incorporating active ligands enhances screening performance, whereas inactive (decoy) ligands produce results similar to apo predictions. The use of template structures further improves outcomes. We also analyze the impact of ligand molecular weight, binding pocket location, and AlphaFold3 ranking scores on screening performance. Our findings indicate that lower molecular weight ligands tend to generate predicted structures that more closely resemble experimental holo structures, thus improving screening efficacy. Conversely, larger ligands (700-800) can induce open binding pockets that favor screening for some targets. These results suggest that employing AlphaFold3 with appropriate ligand inputs is a promising strategy for virtual screening, particularly for proteins lacking experimental structural data.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

In Arabidopsis, CLASSY3 (CLSY3) targets the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery to different loci in reproductive tissues, generating distinct epigenomes via unknown mechanism(s). Here, we discovered that several different REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM (REM) transcription factors are required for methylation at CLSY3 targets specific to male or female reproductive tissues. We designate these factors as REM INSTRUCT METHYLATION (RIMs) and demonstrate that disruption of their DNA binding domains, or the motifs they recognize, blocks RdDM. These findings not only reveal RIMs as the first sex-specific RdDM proteins but also establish a critical role for genetic information in targeting DNA methylation. This novel mode of targeting expands our understanding of how methylation is regulated to include inputs from both genetic and epigenetic information.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

In this task, the decision-maker can choose between two options, one that will only provide rewards to itself (selfish choice) or one that will reward both itself and its cagemate (prosocial choice). Our work reveals that prosocial choices in male mice are not widespread and are only observed in a small proportion of animals.

However, between 2022 and 2024, it reemerged as a more widespread public health concern in South America. We conducted a pooled-sample molecular surveillance to understand the true prevalence of Oropouche fever in Brazil's southernmost state. Over 18 months, we analyzed 4,060 samples to monitor the virus emergence in the Rio Grande do Sul state. We detected the first human case of Oropouche virus in the state, and our phylogenetic reconstruction indicated a travel-related introduction from Amazon region into Rio Grande do Sul. Despite the absence of local transmission, the invasion of Culicoides paraensis and enzootic circulation of the Oropouche virus in Rio Grande do Sul highlight the risk of Oropouche fever outbreaks in the region. We demonstrated that pooled-sample surveillance effectively monitors virus introduction during periods of low endemic circulation, serving as an essential active surveillance tool for the timely detection of virus emergence and enhancing public health preparedness. The multiple introductions of distinct Oropouche virus lineages into southern Brazil underscore the importance of genomic surveillance and public health strategies to monitor and mitigate arbovirus spread in the region.","NA","medrxiv",1740348514069

Predicting patterns of diversity under such background selection has received considerable attention, and recent applications were able to explain a large portion of the variation in diversity across the human genome. However, current models have yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, they display inaccuracies in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes [~] -1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest; second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics allowing for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to population size changes, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire distribution of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under non equilibrium demography and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, neglecting population size changes bias predictions of diversity, which then carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

While computed tomography (CT)-based screening has improved early detection and enabled curative surgeries, the molecular and cellular dynamics driving early-stage LUAD progression remain poorly understood, limiting non-surgical treatment options. To address this gap, we profiled 2.24 million cells from 122 early-stage LUAD patients using multiplexed imaging mass cytometry (IMC). This analysis revealed the molecular, spatial, and temporal dynamics of LUAD development. Our findings uncover a binary progression model. LUAD advances through either inflammation, driven by a balance of cytotoxic and regulatory immune activity, or fibrosis, characterized by stromal activation. Surprisingly, tumor cell populations did not increase significantly. Instead, they displayed a mixed phenotypic profile consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), effectively masking the expansion of malignant cells. Furthermore, we addressed discrepancies between CT-based and histology-based subtyping. CT scans, while non-invasive, often mischaracterize invasive fibrotic tumors that account for 20.5% of LUAD cases as mild, non-solid ground glass opacities (GGOs). Using high-content IMC imaging, we demonstrate that these tumors harbor significant risks and advocate for improved diagnostic strategies. These strategies should integrate molecular profiling to refine patient stratification and therapeutic decision making. Altogether, our study provides a high-resolution, systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment in early-stage LUAD. We characterize key transitions in oncogenesis and propose a precision-driven framework to enhance the detection and management of aggressive disease subtypes.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Seurat, by far the most popular tool for analyzing ST data, uses the Wilcoxon rank-sum test by default for differential expression analysis. However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Score Test (GST) in the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GST with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the GEEs with the robust Wald test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GST demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed that the GST-identified differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways directly implicated in cancer progression. In contrast, the Wilcoxon test-identified genes were enriched in non-cancer pathways and produced substantial false positives, highlighting its limitations for spatially structured data. Our findings suggest that the GST approach is well-suited for ST data, offering more accurate identification of biologically relevant gene expression changes. We have implemented the proposed method in R package ""SpatialGEE"", available on GitHub.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Here, we replace the essential 2A cleavage site at the P1-P2 junction with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), 3CD cleavage site, or T2A sequence, allowing us to catalytically inactivate 2Apro. Viruses with an inactive 2Apro are hampered in replication in cell lines and are severely attenuated in a Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) mouse pancreatitis infection model.

Moreover, using an advanced single-molecule live cell imaging approach, we reveal that 2Apro is important for the initial round of replication of the incoming viral RNA, which is a bottleneck for efficient infection.

Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties, including controllability. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification, which is a fundamental principle in control theory. The incorporation of perturbation inputs is therefore essential for precise characterization of brain dynamics. In this study, we combine a perturbation input paradigm with a network control theory framework and propose a novel method for estimating the controllability Gramian matrix in a simple, theoretically grounded manner. This method provides insights into brain dynamics, including overall controllability (quantified by the Gramians eigenvalues) and specific controllable directions (represented by its eigenvectors). As a proof of concept, we applied our method to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced electroencephalographic (EEG) responses across four motor-related states and two resting states. We found that states such as open-eye rest, closed-eye rest, and motor-related states were more effectively differentiated using controllable directions than overall controllability. However, certain states, like motor execution and motor imagery, remained indistinguishable using these measures. These findings indicate that some brain states differ in their intrinsic control properties as dynamical systems, while others share similarities that make them less distinguishable. This study underscores the value of control theory-based analyses in quantitatively how intrinsic brain states shape the brains responses to stimulation, providing deeper insights into the dynamic properties of these states. This methodology holds promise for diverse applications, including characterizing individual response variability and identifying conditions for optimal stimulation efficacy.

Significant statementThe brain can be viewed as a control system transitioning between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Previous studies using network control theory mostly evaluated brain dynamics without external perturbations, neglecting their role in accurate system identification. This study integrates perturbation inputs with network control theory to propose a method for estimating the controllability Gramian, thereby providing insights into brain dynamics. We applied this approach to TMS-induced EEG responses in motor-related and resting states. Our findings show that controllable directions (eigenvectors) allow better discrimination between states than overall controllability. Our method can quantitatively assess brain state differences, and has potential applications in characterizing individual response variability and optimizing stimulation efficacy.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

DNA damage elicits a DNA damage response (DDR) that includes error-free and error-prone, i.e. mutagenic, repair. The SOS response is a widely conserved system in bacteria that regulates the DDR and depends on the recombinase RecA and the transcriptional repressor LexA. However, RecA/LexA-independent DDRs have been identified in several bacterial species. Here, using a whole-cell, label-free quantitative proteomics approach, we map the proteomic response in Myxococcus xanthus to mitomycin C treatment and the lack of LexA. In doing so, we confirm a LexA-independent DDR in M. xanthus. Using a candidate approach, we identify DdiA, a transcriptional regulator of the XRE family, and demonstrate that it regulates a subset of the LexA-independent DDR genes. ddiA is expressed heterogeneously in a subpopulation of cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress and reversibly induced population-wide in response to such stress. DdiA, indirectly or directly, activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Accordingly, the {Delta}ddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, suggesting that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis. We speculate that the DdiA-dependent response is tailored to counter replication stress, thereby preventing the induction of the complete RecA/LexA-dependent DDR in the absence of exogenous genotoxic stress.

ImportanceDNA damage repair is essential for genome integrity and depends on the DNA damage response (DDR). While the RecA/LexA-dependent SOS response is widely conserved in bacteria, there are also RecA/LexA-independent DDRs. Here, we identify the DNA damage-induced transcriptional regulator DdiA in Myxococcus xanthus and demonstrate that it regulates part of the RecA/LexA-independent DDR. DdiA activates the expression of dnaE2, which encodes the DnaE2 error-prone DNA polymerase, and inhibits the expression of recX, which encodes RecX, a negative regulator of RecA. Because the {Delta}ddiA mutant has a lower mutation frequency than the wild-type but also a fitness defect, we suggest that DdiA mediates a trade-off between fitness and mutagenesis and that the DdiA-dependent DDR is specifically tailored to counter replication stress.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

It is considered the longest-lived vertebrate on Earth, with an estimated lifespan of 392{+/-}120 years. Despite its remarkable longevity and lifestyle, there have been no genomic studies on this species. Here, we report the first, chromosome-level assembly of the Greenland shark genome, which is 5.9 Gb in size with an N50 length of 233 Mb, and contains 37,125 predicted genes with a completeness score of 86.5%. We found that the copy numbers of three gene families (TNF, TLR, LRRFIP), which are involved in activating the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway, are significantly increased in the Greenland shark compared to short-lived shark species. In the rhodopsin of this deep-sea dweller, we detected amino acid substitutions that result in spectral tuning for the so-called 'blue shift', suggesting adaptive evolution to dim-light vision. We also elucidate the dynamics of the effective population size (Ne) of the Greenland shark and its close relative, the Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus). These genomic analyses offer new insights into the molecular basis of the exceptional longevity of the Greenland shark and highlight potential genetic mechanisms that could inform future research into longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

These macrophages are derived from monocytes that are recruited from the circulation into the developing lesion, where they proliferate and differentiate into macrophages, with proliferation producing most of the macrophages in the resulting lesions. However, the signals and transcriptional events driving the proliferation of atherosclerotic plaque macrophages remain poorly understood. Analysis of human plaque spanning a range of disease severity identified a subpopulation of macrophages that expressed the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA2. These GATA2-expressing macrophages had a transcriptional profile that was intermediary between monocytes and mature macrophages, and selectively upregulated genes associated with proliferation and apoptosis. The expression of GATA2 was concomitant with plaque macrophage proliferation at all stages of disease, with over 90% of proliferating macrophages expressing GATA2. GATA2 was upregulated in macrophages following exposure to oxLDL, with GATA2 expression being necessary and sufficient for the proliferation of these macrophages. In these cells, GATA2 mediates proliferation by upregulating expression of the proto-oncogene MYB, while simultaneously decreasing sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the unfolded protein response. Together, these data identify GATA2 as a transcription factor upregulated by atherogenic stimuli that functions as the primary mediator of macrophage proliferation in atherosclerotic plaque.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Automated 3D light sheet fluorescence imaging coupled with computational analysis was applied to evaluate drug IgG distribution and plaque counts throughout the intact brain of transgenic APP/PS1 mice.

Detecting population-specific TE insertions at scale is crucial for understanding species-specific phenotypic traits. However, tools for constructing comprehensive pan-TE databases remain limited. To address this gap, we develop panHiTE, a population-scale TE detection and annotation tool with several core innovations. panHiTE features a deep learning-based long terminal repeat retrotransposon (LTR-RT) detection algorithm, outperforming existing tools in both sensitivity and precision. It also introduces a novel de-redundancy algorithm, which eliminates highly divergent redundant TE instances, significantly reducing the size of the TE library. Additionally, panHiTE can detect low-copy TEs, which are overlooked in individual genome analyses and absent from existing databases due to their rarity. Furthermore, panHiTE allows for TE-gene association analysis, enabling comprehensive insights into TE-driven phenotypic variation. panHiTE, powered by a Nextflow pipeline, enables efficient and scalable TE detection in large plant genomes and has successfully been applied to hundreds of plant population genomes, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Here, we demonstrate that individual alpha frequency (IAF) from the parietal cortex predicted TBWs and perceptual sensitivities in body ownership and visuotactile simultaneity judgment tasks, with faster frequencies narrowing TBWs and increasing sensitivities, and vice versa. Modulating IAF through brain stimulation altered TBWs and sensitivities, establishing a causal relationship. Computational modeling linked IAF to uncertainty in asynchrony information within the causal inference process, providing a mechanism. These findings demonstrate that parietal alpha frequency shapes the sense of body ownership by modulating the temporal integration of bodily sensory signals.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

For astrocytes to serve such purposes, the interactions with synapses in neuronal circuits require a level of specificity beyond overall synaptic support. A systematic mapping of the astrocyte-connectome relationship would enable the testing of these hypotheses - such analysis is however still lacking, in particular for circuits in the cerebral cortex. Here, utilizing previously published connectomic data of more than 200,000 synapses, we systematically analyzed the spatial relation between astrocytes and synapses in mouse somatosensory cortex. We developed a quantitative assessment of astrocyte-synapse proximity, finding that only 22.7% of synapses are contacted by astrocytic processes for more than 50% of their synaptic circumference. This non-ubiquitous astrocytic attachment would render astrocyte-synapse specificity plausible. Astrocytic coverage depended strongly on synapse types, with thalamocortical shaft synapses being the most covered by astrocytic processes. We furthermore observed a strong dependence of astrocytic synaptic coverage on synapse size, which was exclusive for excitatory spine synapses. We then investigated the possible relation of astrocytic synaptic coverage to neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity, finding ultrastructural evidence for substantially reduced astrocytic support at synapses consistent with long-term depression, but not for astrocytic coverage dependence on baseline neuronal presynaptic activity. Together, our data demonstrate a high level of specificity of astrocyte-synapse interactions for particular synaptic types. They indicate the potential relevance of astrocytic coverage for synapse stability, in particular for large synapses, suggesting a contribution to long-term maintenance of learned synaptic states. These methods will allow a systematic testing of hypotheses about glial-neuronal interaction in various brain regions, disease models and species including human.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Here, we characterize the molecular organization of the distal tip of vertebrate MCC cilia, revealing two distinct domains occupied by distinct protein constituents. Using frog, mouse, and human MCCs, we find that two largely uncharacterized proteins, Ccdc78 and Ccdc33 occupy a specialized region at the extreme distal tip, and these are required for the normal organization of other tip proteins, including Spef1, Cep104, and Eb3. Ccdc78 and Cccdc33 are also independently required for normal length regulation of MCC cilia. Mechanistically, Ccdc78 and Ccdc33 display robust microtubule-bundling activity both in vivo and in vitro.

While underlying mechanisms remain elusive, immune factors and lifestyle components, such as diet and physical activity, could play a role in shaping disease outcomes. Since Th cells are key drivers of RA, this study characterised CD4 Th subset frequencies, including Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th1/17 cells, in a cohort of males and females with established RA. Considering the role of diet and lifestyle in RA development, we also evaluated participant diet and lifestyle patterns. Methods: An observational cross-sectional cohort study profiling 39 individuals (19 RA and 20 age and sex matched controls) with no major co-morbidities was conducted. Percentages of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Th1/17 cells from peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry as well as serum levels of RF and cytokines IL17a, IFN-{gamma}, TNF-, GM-CSF, TGF-{beta}, IL-6, and CRP by ELISA. Dietary intake was assessed by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), the Dietary inflammatory Index (DII) calculated from nutrient intake. Physical activity levels were evaluated by Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Results: Sex-specific differences of Th17, Th1 an Th2 cells were observed in RA groups. Males had lower levels of Th1 cells and higher levels of Th17 cells than control subjects, while females had lower levels of Th2 cells than controls. Female RA subjects had higher ratio of Th1:Th2 cells than controls, while male RA subjects had higher Th17:Th1 ratio than controls. Interestingly, circulating CD4 Th subset levels were predictive of RA in this cohort. No changes in cytokine levels were observed. The male RA group consumed 30% less carbohydrate (RA = 156g +/- 57g, Control = 253g +/- 59g; p=0.003), 37% less sugar (RA = 74.1g +/- 29g, Control = 118g +/-33g; p=0.004) and 30% less dietary fibre (R = 33g +/- 8g, Control = 48g +/- 13 g; p=0.008) than the male control group. The female RA group had the lowest consumption of alcohol in comparison to female control group (RA = 0.31g, Control = 8.97g; p=0.047). Male subjects had a 4x higher DII than females (p=0.012). Conclusions: Our findings highlight potential sex-specific differences in CD4+ Th cell subsets in individuals with established RA, indicating that sex may influence immune cell composition in this disease. Furthermore, dietary components showed sex-specific consumption patterns, underscoring the potential role of tailored lifestyle interventions in modulating immune responses in RA. Evaluating immunological sex differences and dietary and lifestyle factors may be important for enhancing management strategies in RA.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

We previously discovered that human TB granulomas are enriched for immunosuppressive factors typically associated with tumor-immune evasion, raising the intriguing possibility that they promote tolerance to infection. In this study, our goal was to identify the prime drivers for establishing this tolerogenic niche and to determine if the magnitude of this response correlates with bacterial persistence. To do this, we conducted a multimodal spatial analysis of 52 granulomas from 16 non-human primates (NHP) who were infected with low dose Mtb for 9-12 weeks. Notably, each granuloma's bacterial burden was individually quantified allowing us to directly ask how granuloma spatial structure and function relate to infection control. We found that a universal feature of TB granulomas was partitioning of the myeloid core into two distinct metabolic environments, one of which is hypoxic. This hypoxic environment associated with pathologic immune cell states, dysfunctional cellular organization of the granuloma, and a near-complete blockade of lymphocyte infiltration that would be required for a successful host response. The extent of these hypoxia-associated features correlated with worsened bacterial burden. We conclude that hypoxia governs immune cell state and organization within granulomas and is a potent driver of subverted immunity during TB.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Myeloid cells play a critical role in shaping the inflammatory environment and influencing disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway reprograms myeloid cells into an immunoregulatory phenotype, leading to reduced neuroinflammation and disease severity. Using both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human-derived myeloid cells, we show that Wnt agonist treatment promotes the expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-L1 and PD-L2, suppressing pro-inflammatory responses. In the chronic and relapsing-remitting EAE models, Wnt activation significantly reduced disease severity, immune cell infiltration into the CNS, and pathogenic T cell responses. Notably, in relapsing-remitting EAE, Wnt treatment prevented new relapses in a PD-L1-dependent manner, highlighting the crucial role of myeloid cell-mediated immune regulation. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for Wnt signaling in myeloid cell immunoregulation and suggest that targeting this pathway could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for MS and other autoimmune diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

The FGFR1 agonists, including Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and FG loop peptide (FGL), have been implicated in multiple disease therapy. Whether FGFR1 agonists can improve pathology and cognitive function in AD remains unknown. Here, we showed that administration of FGF1 and FGL to the AD mouse model reversed spatial memory impairment, enhanced neurogenesis, suppressed reactive astrogliosis, and restricted dystrophic neurite. However, only FGF1 treatment reduced the deposition of senile plaque.

While tools for sequencing, synthesis, and editing of genomic code have transformed biological research, intelligently composing new biological systems would also require a deep understanding of the immense complexity encoded by genomes. We introduce Evo 2, a biological foundation model trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs from a highly curated genomic atlas spanning all domains of life. We train Evo 2 with 7B and 40B parameters to have an unprecedented 1 million token context window with single-nucleotide resolution. Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation--from noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants--without task-specific finetuning. Applying mechanistic interpretability analyses, we reveal that Evo 2 autonomously learns a breadth of biological features, including exon-intron boundaries, transcription factor binding sites, protein structural elements, and prophage genomic regions. Beyond its predictive capabilities, Evo 2 generates mitochondrial, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic sequences at genome scale with greater naturalness and coherence than previous methods. Guiding Evo 2 via inference-time search enables controllable generation of epigenomic structure, for which we demonstrate the first inference-time scaling results in biology. We make Evo 2 fully open, including model parameters, training code, inference code, and the OpenGenome2 dataset, to accelerate the exploration and design of biological complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

However, despite strong performance across genomic loci , S2F models struggle with inter-individual variation. Training a model to make genotype-dependent predictions at a single locus-an approach we call personal genome training-offers a potential solution. We introduce SAGE-net, a scalable framework and software package for training and evaluating S2F models using personal genomes. Leveraging its scalability, we conduct extensive experiments on model and training hyperparameters, demonstrating that training on personal genomes improves predictions for held-out individuals. However, the model achieves this by identifying predictive variants rather than learning a cis-regulatory grammar that generalizes across loci. This failure to generalize persists across a range of hyperparameter settings. These findings highlight the need for further exploration to unlock the full potential of S2F models in decoding the regulatory grammar of personal genomes. Scalable software and infrastructure development will be critical to this progress.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Run-on and sequencing assays measure the production of nascent RNAs and can provide an effective data source for discovering functional elements. However, the accurate inference of functional elements from run-on sequencing data remains an open problem because the signal is noisy and challenging to model. Here we investigated computational approaches that convert run-on and sequencing data into annotations representing transcription units, including genes and non-coding RNAs. We developed a convolutional neural network, called convolutional discovery of gene anatomy using PRO-seq (CGAP), trained to identify different anatomical features of a transcription unit, which were then stitched together into transcript annotations using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Comparison with existing methods showed a significant performance improvement using our novel CGAP-HMM approach. We developed a voting system that ensembles the top three annotation strategies, resulting in large and significant improvements in transcription unit annotation accuracy over the best performing individual method. Finally, we also report a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) as a generative approach to transcription unit annotation that shows promise for further development. Collectively our work provides novel tools for de novo transcription unit annotation from run-on and sequencing data that are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

In general practice in England up to one-in-two nursing posts are predicted to be unfilled by 2030/31, with Wales similarly threatened. This is reflected internationally. Limited attention has been paid to how cultural and structural issues affect retention of nurses in general practice. The aim of our study is to understand factors that challenge retention and support nurses to stay in general practice.

MethodsWe conducted an exploratory qualitative interview study with n=41 with members of nursing teams working in, or who have worked in, general practice as well as nurse leaders associated with general practice across England and Wales. Recruitment was through professional and social media networks and snowballing techniques. Data were collected between October 2023-June 2024 and analysed following framework analysis. University of York ethics approval (Ref: HSRGC/2023/586/A) was gained. The study was funded by the General Nursing Council Trust.

ResultsRecognition of value of nurses working in general practice was central to the retention of nurses at all levels of practice and was affected by structural and cultural issues and reflected in several themes: The essence of nursing in general practice; The commodification and deprofessionalisation of nursing in general practice; Opportunities for development; Employment of nurses outside of the National Health Service; Lack of voice, precarity of position and lack of recourse; Tipping points.

ConclusionCultural and structural issues impacted on retention of nurses in general practice. While some supported retention, others revealed deep-seated, complex issues which require addressing at practice, local and national organisational levels. Nurses in general practice experience factors which leave them vulnerable and underserved. Policy makers, employers and professional organisations need to work to support retention and enable nurses in general practice, not only to survive, but thrive.

However, the difficulty in comprehensively defining the rules for describing metadata and limited user awareness of best practices for metadata have resulted in substantial variability depending on the submitter. This inconsistency poses significant challenges to the findability and reusability of the data. Given the vast scale of BioSample, which hosts over 40 million records, manual curation is impractical. Rule-based automatic ontology mapping methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their effectiveness is limited by the heterogeneity of BioSample metadata. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing and have been expected as promising tools for automating metadata curation. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in extracting cell line names from BioSample descriptions using a gold-standard dataset derived from ChIP-Atlas, a secondary database of epigenomics experiment data, which manually curates samples. Our results demonstrated that LLM-assisted methods outperformed traditional approaches, achieving higher accuracy and coverage. We further extended this approach to extraction of information about experimentally manipulated genes from metadata where manual curation had not yet been applied in ChIP-Atlas. This also yielded successful results for the usage of the database, which facilitates more precise filtering of data and prevents misinterpretation caused by inclusion of unintended data. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to improve the findability and reusability of experimental data in general, significantly reducing user workload and enabling more effective scientific data management.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that underlie much of the evolutionary flexibility of bacteria. Evolving plasmids face selective pressures on their hosts, but also compete within the cell for replication, making them an ideal system for studying the joint dynamics of multilevel selection. While theory indicates that within-cell selection should matter for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of within-cell plasmid fitness and its consequences has remained elusive. Here we measure the within-cell fitness of competing plasmids and characterize drift and selective dynamics. We achieve this by the controlled splitting of synthetic plasmid dimers to create balanced competition experiments. We find that incompatible plasmids co-occur for longer than expected due to methylation-based plasmid eclipsing. During this period of co-occurrence, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell selective advantage over their competing plasmids, leading to preferential fixation of silent plasmids. When the transcribed gene is beneficial to the cell, for example an antibiotic resistance gene, there is a cell-plasmid fitness tradeoff mediated by the dominance of the beneficial trait. Surprisingly, more dominant plasmid-encoded traits are less likely to fix but more likely to initially invade than less dominant traits. Taken together, our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by dynamics at two levels, with a transient, but critical, contribution of within-cell fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Insertion sequences, the simplest MGEs usually encoding only the necessary genes for transposition and maintenance, are widespread in bacterial genomes, and are particularly common in plasmids. Plasmids, self-replicating extrachromosomal DNA elements, often exist in multiple copies imparting a stochastic barrier to the fixation of an insertion sequence by limiting the proportion of the plasmid population harboring the IS. In this work we demonstrate that to overcome this, the IS200/605 family of insertion sequences utilizes programmable RNA guided nucleases as gene drive to spread the IS through the plasmid population. TnpB, the likely ancestor of Cas12, records the specific insertion site of the IS in its RNA guide to prevent loss of the IS during transposition. When introduced to a plasmid TnpB will be reprogrammed to target and cleave IS- plasmids, resulting in biased replication of only those IS+ plasmids. Furthermore, the gene drive activity is critical for the IS to invade high copy plasmid populations. Because TnpB can only be mobilized between microbes on other mobile genetic elements, this advantage to fixing in plasmids may help explain the prevalence of TnpB across the tree of life. More generally, the unique pressures arising from movement between genetic contexts with different multiplicities shapes the evolution of strategies for MGE spread.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

We find that across 11,098 genomes comprising 2,606 taxonomic groups, 215 groups significantly vary from their respective lineages in terms of their BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs) completeness. Additionally, 169 groups display an elevated complement of duplicated orthologs, likely as an artifact of whole genome duplication events. Secondly, we investigate the extent of taxonomic congruence in BUSCO-derived whole-genome phylogenies. For 275 suitable families out of 543 tested, sites evolving at higher rates produce at most 23.84% more taxonomically concordant, and at least 46.15% less terminally variable phylogenies compared to lower-rate sites. We find topological differences between BUSCO concatenated and coalescent trees to be marginal and conclude that higher rate sites from concatenated alignments produce the most congruent and least variable phylogenies. Finally, we show that BUSCO misannotations can lead to misrepresentations of assembly quality. To overcome this issue, we filter a Curated set of BUSCOs (CUSCOs) that provide up to 6.99% fewer false positives compared to the standard BUSCO search and introduce novel methods for comparing assemblies using BUSCO synteny.

Apical hook opening in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings serves as an excellent model to study how coordinated cell expansion generates organ bending. Several works highlight the influence of hormone signaling, cell wall mechanics, and environmental cues on cortical microtubule (cMT) arrangement in bending tissues. However, the precise genetic hierarchy governing these processes remains largely unknown. Results: Here, we reveal a two-step growth rate during apical hook opening, in which an initial phase of differential cell expansion is followed by a phase of more balanced growth. We show that cMT re-arrangement precedes and predicts cell expansion patterns, suggesting a central role in coordinating differential growth. Our findings indicate that PIF transcription factors regulate this process, as pifq mutants fail to align cMT reorganization with growth dynamics, resulting in premature hook opening. RNA-seq analysis further supports a role for PIFs in coordinating cell wall remodeling and microtubule-associated gene expression, including kinesins and cell wall-modifying enzymes. Conclusions: Our study uncovers a PIF-dependent regulatory mechanism that orchestrates cytoskeletal dynamics and cell expansion to control apical hook opening.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

For this, cellular and circuit components in intact brains need to be identified and studied using e.g. viral tracing, electrophysiology, imaging, activity perturbations, and behavior. A commonality of these approaches is the need to establish the anatomical locations of both experimental parameters (e.g. recording/injection sites) and circuit components (e.g. cell bodies/projections). The development of standardized coordinate systems, i.e. reference brain atlases, has proven essential for reproducible, cross-laboratory mapping of anatomical data. However, the process of mapping, analyzing, and visualizing anatomical data remains challenging, especially for users lacking programming expertise. Here, we introduce DMC-BrainMap, an open-source napari plugin designed as a user-friendly tool for streamlined processing and whole-brain analysis of anatomical data. The working principle and core functionalities include all steps after image acquisition, i.e., preprocessing of images, registration of images to a reference atlas, segmentation of different anatomical features, and data analysis/visualization. DMC-BrainMap can be applied to histological data obtained from a variety of model organisms at different developmental stages, including mouse, rat, and zebrafish. We demonstrate the utility of DMC-BrainMap by mapping and quantifying cell bodies, axonal densities, injection sites as well as placement of optical fibers and Neuropixels probes. Further, we show how spatial transcriptomics data can be integrated into the DMC-BrainMap workflow. By eliminating the need for programming by the user, DMC-BrainMap provides an easy-to-use tool for increased rigor, reproducibility, and data sharing in neuroscientific research involving animal models.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Currently, limited information exists about long-term oral health manifestations in COVID-19 patients with limited healthcare access.

MethodsWe conducted a sequential, cross-sectional study (December 2020-March 2024) to assess how racial/ethnic differences (Black/Hispanic vs White/Asian) and health disparities affect oral and non-oral long COVID symptoms and their relationship with COVID-19 vaccination. We retrospectively reviewed patients oral health record from University of Illinois Chicago dental clinics before vaccination (December 2020; N=1150; Covid+/- N=575/group) and after vaccination (December 2021; N=592; Covid+/- N=292/group). Participants were recruited in two separate prospective groups of COVID-19 positive subjects (February-April 2021; pre-vaccination: N=158; January-March 2024; post-vaccination: N=171), we examined clinical indicators of oral (periodontal and salivary glands) and non-oral (neurologic) sequalae 3-6 months after initial exposure. We measured viral S protein by flow cytometry and quantified inflammatory markers, viral entry receptors, and oral viral load to correlate molecular, and cellular changes in COVID-19 positive subjects before and after vaccination.

ResultsOur results identified racial disparity indicating oral associated post-acute sequelae (PASC) primarily manifested as periodontal (gum) disease (COVID-19 positive: 73.1{+/-}18.9% vs COVID-19 negative: 33.1{+/-}14.3%) and correlated with higher rates of dry mouth (57.5%), taste disturbance (47%), and smell loss (20%). Vaccination reduced oral PASC in COVID-19 positive subjects; however, periodontal disease indicators persisted compared to the COVID-19 negative group. Notably, 3-6 months post-infection, while SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) transcript was rarely detected in saliva ([~]6%), its protein was commonly detected ([~]70%) in the COVID-19 positive subjects indicating incomplete viral clearance. This correlates with significantly higher salivary expression of viral entry receptors (ACE2, and TRMPSS2), and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-8), in COVID-19 positive subjects. This finding was further supported by higher prevalence of other oral viruses including Epstein-Barr Virus (70.5%), Herpes Simplex Virus (8.1%), and Human Papillomavirus (17.5%) in COVID-19 positive subjects.

InterpretationCOVID-19 history significantly correlates with severe oral health complications in predominantly Black communities, while vaccination reduced but did not eliminate these issues. The oral cavity serves as a long-term viral reservoir, and periodontal inflammation with increased oral viral presence in COVID-positive patients may increase susceptibility to oral and non-oral viral diseases and identify risk for long COVID.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Prior obesity and metabolic disease increase the severity of acute disease, but SARS-CoV-2 infection also contributes to the development of new-onset metabolic disease. Since the COVID pandemic occurred in the context of the global obesity epidemic, an important question is the extent to which pre-existing obesity modifies long-term responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized a nonhuman primate model to compare the effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant in lean and obese/insulin-resistant adult male rhesus macaques over a 6-month time course. While some longitudinal responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including overall viral dynamics, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG induction, cytokine profiles, and tissue persistence of viral RNA, did not appreciably differ between lean and obese animals, other responses, including neutralizing Ab dynamics, lung pathology, body weight, degree of insulin sensitivity, adipocytokine profiles, body temperature, and nighttime activity levels were significantly different in lean versus obese animals. Furthermore, several parameters in lean animals were altered following SARS-CoV-2 infection to resemble those in obese animals. Notably, persistent changes in multiple parameters were present in most animals, suggesting that PASC may be more prevalent than estimated from self-reported symptoms in human studies.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

In this study, we integrated single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate an atlas of cell types and expression domains during the early stages of wheat spike development. We characterized spatiotemporal expression of 99 genes by smFISH in 48,225 cells at the early transition (W1.5), late double ridge (W2.5) and lemma primordia (W3.25) stages. These cells were clustered into 21 different expression domains, including four beneath the developing spikelets and three different meristematic regions, which were consistent across spikelets and sections. We also identified genes differentially expressed during the transition of the inflorescence meristem into a terminal spikelet. The smFISH study was complemented by the scRNA-seq profiling of 26,009 cells from W2.5 and W3.25 that were clustered into 23 distinct cell types. We annotated the single-cell clusters as meristem, boundary domains, cortex, central spike, epidermis, and vasculature by using known markers, co-expression analysis of genes selected from the smFISH study, and correlation matrices of clusters identified in both studies. The scRNA-seq data uncovered genes associated with boundary genes TCP24 and FZP, as well as the meristematic genes AGL6 and ULT1. The smFISH and scRNA-seq studies provided complementary tools for characterizing the gene networks that regulate spike development, supporting the functional characterization of key regulatory genes, and informing the engineering of more productive wheat spikes.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

However, challenges persist in capturing sidechain packing, condition-dependent conformational dynamics, and biomolecular interactions, primarily due to scarcity of high-quality training data. Emerging techniques, including cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and high-throughput crystallography, promise vast new sources of structural data, but translating raw experimental observations into mechanistically interpretable atomic models remains a key bottleneck. Here, we aim to address these challenges by improving the efficiency of structural analysis through combining experimental measurements with a landmark protein structure prediction method -- AlphaFold2. We present an augmentation of AlphaFold2, ROCKET, that refines its predictions using cryo-EM, cryo-ET, and X-ray crystallography data, and demonstrate that this approach captures biologically important structural variation that AlphaFold2 does not. By performing structure optimization in the space of coevolutionary embeddings, rather than Cartesian coordinates, ROCKET automates difficult modeling tasks, such as flips of functional loops and domain rearrangements, that are beyond the scope of current state-ofthe-art methods and, in some instances, even manual human modeling. The ability to efficiently sample these barrier-crossing rearrangements unlocks a new horizon for scalable and automated model building. Crucially, ROCKET does not require retraining of AlphaFold2 and is readily adaptable to multimers, ligand-cofolding, and other data modalities. Conversely, our differentiable crystallographic and cryo-EM target functions are capable of augmenting other structure prediction methods. ROCKET thus provides an extensible framework for the integration of experimental observables with biomolecular machine learning.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

To investigate this possibility, we compared cell-type-specific gene expression across species in the developing mouse and human neocortex, and human cortical organoids, by generating a shared transcriptional reference framework. This identified genes with conserved/divergent expression patterns, providing a molecular foundation to interrogate species-specific cellular properties. Using this resource, we discovered that the transcription factor JUNB is expressed in human but not mouse progenitors. Through cell-type-specific gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice and human organoids, we demonstrate that JUNB bidirectionally controls human cortical features, including progenitor proliferation rates, neuronal production timing, and total neuronal output. This reveals how cell-type-specific regulation of shared genes during development can drive species-specific cortical features, providing a framework for understanding the molecular basis of cortical evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

The spatial organization of cell surface proteins is central to these processes. High-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proximity labeling have advanced studies of surface protein associations, but the spatial organization of the complete surface proteome remains uncharted. In this study, we systematically mapped the surface proteome of human T-lymphocytes and B-lymphoblasts using proximity labeling of 85 antigens, identified from over 100 antibodies tested for binding to surface-exposed proteins. These experiments were coupled with an optimized data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry workflow to generate a robust dataset. Unsupervised clustering of the resulting interactome revealed functional modules, including well-characterized complexes such as the T-cell receptor and HLA class I/II, alongside novel clusters. Notably, we identified mitochondrial proteins localized to the surface, including the transcription factor TFAM, suggesting previously unappreciated roles for mitochondrial proteins at the plasma membrane. A high-accuracy machine learning classifier predicted over 6,000 surface protein associations, highlighting functional associations such as IL10RBs role as a negative regulator of type I interferon signaling. Spatial modeling of the surface proteome provided insights into protein dispersion patterns, distinguishing widely distributed proteins, such as CD45, from localized antigens, such as CD226 pointing to active mechanisms of regulating surface organization.

We collated evidence for these pathways through literature reviews. Our reviews found no studies directly linking climate change and tuberculosis, warranting research to build evidence for action.

The serine cycle forms acetyl-coenzyme A from C1 molecules without carbon loss but has bottlenecks that hinder engineering efforts. We adopted three synthetic variants (serine-threonine cycle, homoserine cycle, and modified serine cycle) that yield serine in a methanol-dependent fashion to overcome these challenges. By dividing these metabolic designs into functional modules, we systematically compared their performance for implementation in vivo.

Although tangible improvements have been made in academic publishing and conference participation, gender imbalances in citations among leading neuroscience journals persist and are increasing with time. Here, we expand upon prior work by providing a more comprehensive analysis of citation practices across fifty journals to improve our understanding of the dynamics of the field as a whole, particularly across different kinds of journals. We first confirm that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than expected if gender were unrelated to citation practices. Further, we demonstrate that this effect is strongest in the most influential journals. We also find that the apparent closure of the gender gap is due to the interaction of three unique, nuanced patterns of citation: one that is characterized by relative overcitation of papers with men as both first and last author; one that is characterized by relative overcitation of women as the last author, and one that is characterized by relative undercitation of women as the first author. In addition, we find that these patterns of citation are not distributed evenly across the field: more prestigious journals tend to have articles with citation gaps favoring men, while less prestigious journals tend to overcite papers with women as last authors. We discuss potential drivers for these patterns and suggest some implications for the field moving forward.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

However, no study has validated its functional role in these diseases, explored the disease stage at which it is acting nor its mechanism of action. Here, we show that syntaxin-6 acts at early stages of prion disease in experimental mice by increasing disease transmission risk following inoculation with low prion doses. Conversely, syntaxin-6 does not affect prion propagation kinetics or toxicity during established disease. Syntaxin-6 manipulation in cellular models profoundly alters the subcellular distribution and morphologies of disease-related PrP and modifies prion export. Furthermore, syntaxin-6 knockout in a transgenic tauopathy mouse model exerts protective effects on numerous physiological, behavioural and neuropathological outcome measures. Therefore, our studies firmly establish syntaxin-6 as a modifier of prion and tau pathogenesis, providing key insights into a fundamental mechanism of neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

A critically important aspect of anaphylaxis pertains to the factors that modulate its severity. The human microbiota is known to influence oral tolerance, but the microbial mechanisms directly involved in IgE-mediated anaphylaxis remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that human saliva harbors peanut-degrading bacteria that metabolize immunodominant allergens (Ara h 1 and Ara h 2) and alter IgE binding. Additionally, we provide in vivo evidence showing that oral bacteria metabolize peanut allergens, influencing systemic allergen exposure and the severity of anaphylaxis. Finally, in a clinical study, we observe that common peanut-degrading bacteria, such as Rothia, from the oral cavity, are more abundant in peanut-allergic patients who exhibit better tolerance to allergen exposure. Altogether, these results demonstrate the role of the human microbiota in modulating IgE-mediated reactions through allergen metabolism. These findings reveal a novel microbial mechanism with potential to prevent, or reduce, the severity of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

SOS splicing, which operates independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern recognition system triggered by base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of the DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells; AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A, allowing RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a novel, conserved, and RNA structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing and that one function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of TE-mediated gene perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Accurately identifying regions that are spatially coherent in both gene expression and physical tissue structures is an emerging topic, but challenging due to the lack of ground truth labels which renders complicating validation of clustering consistency and reproducibility. This highlights a need for a computational evaluation framework to rigorously and unbiasedly assess clustering performance.

ResultsTo address this gap, we propose STEAM (Spatial Transcriptomics Evaluation Algorithm and Metric), a user-friendly computational pipeline designed to evaluate the consistency and reliability of clustering results by leveraging machine learning classification and prediction methods, with the goal of maintaining the spatial proximity and gene expression patterns within clusters. We benchmarked STEAM on various public datasets, spanning multi-cell to single-cell resolution, as well as spatial transcriptomics and proteomics. The results highlighted its robustness and generalizability through comprehensive statistical evaluation metrics, such as Kappa score, F1 score, accuracy, and adjusted rand index. Notably, STEAM supports multi-sample training, enabling cross-replicate clustering consistency assessment. Moreover, STEAM provides practical guidance by comparing clustering results across multiple approaches; here, we evaluated four different methods, including spatial-aware and spatial-ignorant approaches. In summary, we believe that STEAM provides researchers a promising tool for evaluating clustering robustness and benchmarking clustering performance for spatial omics data, offering valuable insights to drive reproducible discoveries in spatial biology.

This poses a fundamental computational challenge: optimally binding signals sharing the same communicative intention (e.g. looking at the addressee while speaking) and segregating unrelated signals (e.g. looking away while coughing), all within the rapid turn-taking dynamics of conversation. Critically, the computational mechanisms underlying this extraordinary feat remain largely unknown. Here, we cast face-to-face communication as a Bayesian Causal Inference problem to formally test whether prior expectations arbitrate between the integration and segregation of vocal and bodily signals. Moreover, we asked whether there is a stronger prior tendency to integrate audiovisual signals that show the same communicative intention, thus carrying a crossmodal pragmatic correspondence. In a spatial localization task, participants watched audiovisual clips of a speaker where the audio (voice) and the video (bodily cues) were sampled either from congruent positions or at increasing spatial disparities. Crucially, we manipulated the pragmatic correspondence of the signals: in a communicative condition, the speaker addressed the participant with their head, gaze and speech; in a non-communicative condition, the speaker kept the head down and produced a meaningless vocalization. We measured audiovisual integration through the ventriloquist effect, which quantifies how much the perceived audio position is misplaced towards the video position. Bayesian Causal Inference outperformed competing models in explaining participants behaviour, demonstrating that prior expectations guide multisensory integration during face-to-face communication. Remarkably, participants showed a stronger prior tendency to integrate vocal and bodily information when signals conveyed congruent communicative intent, suggesting that pragmatic correspondences enhance multisensory integration. Collectively, our findings provide novel and compelling evidence that face-to-face communication is shaped by deeply ingrained expectations about how multisensory signals should be structured and interpreted.

Author summaryFace-to-face communication is complex: what we say is coupled with bodily signals, offset in time, which may or may not work in concert to convey meaning. Yet, the brain rapidly determines which multisensory signals belong together and which, instead, must be kept apart, suggesting that prior expectations play a crucial role in this decision-making process. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis using Bayesian computational modelling, which allows for isolating the contribution of prior expectations and sensory uncertainty on the final perceptual decision. We found that people have a stronger prior tendency to combine vocal and bodily signals when they convey the same communicative intent (i.e. the speaker addresses the observer concurrently with their head, gaze and speech) relative to when this correspondence is absent. Thus, the brain uses prior expectations to bind multisensory signals that carry converging communicative meaning. These findings provide key insight into the sophisticated mechanisms underpinning efficient multimodal communication.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

However, most underlying gene discovery efforts have focused on individuals of European ancestry, limiting insights into genetic risks across diverse populations. To help address this, the Genomics of Autism in Latin American Ancestries Consortium (GALA) was formed, presenting here the largest sequencing study of ASD in Latin American individuals (n>15,000). We identified 35 genome-wide significant (FDR < 0.05) ASD risk genes, with substantial overlap with findings from European cohorts, and highly constrained genes showing consistent signal across populations. The results provide support for emerging (e.g., MARK2, YWHAG, PACS1, RERE, SPEN, GSE1, GLS, TNPO3, ANKRD17) and established ASD genes, and for the utility of genetic testing approaches for deleterious variants in diverse populations, while also demonstrating the ongoing need for more inclusive genetic research and testing. We conclude that the biology of ASD is universal and not impacted to any detectable degree by ancestry.

Humans can also transmit viral infections back to domestic and wild animals, which can then act as reservoir for the maintenance of viruses, with the risk of epidemic diseases re-emergence. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing the COVID-19, likely originated from wildlife and has already been evidenced to be transmitted from humans to captive, domestic and wild animals. In particular, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) show high-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following human contamination, and recent data suggest that white-tailed deer could act as an emerging virus reservoir. Here, we investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 could also have emerged in several longitudinally-monitored populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in direct contact with humans in France. We performed indirect tests (serological ELISAs and seroneutralization) on serum collected pre- and post-emergence of the virus in human populations. We also performed direct tests (nasal swabs followed by RT-PCR) to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in those populations in 2022. We also investigated the exposure and prevalence of the virus in three other cervid species in France. ELISA tests were positive for 2.20 % of the sera tested, both pre- and post-emergence of the virus, but all positive samples were negative with seroneutralization. Direct PCR testing showed no positive results in 2022. Thus, although seroprevalence increased after the COVID-19 emergence (2022) in one out of three roe deer population, our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has not emerged in those populations, and that ELISA cross-reaction with another circulating virus, possibly an unidentified bovine coronavirus, is possible.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

Reproductive isolation can be generated by different mechanisms that have been extensively characterized, yet how their interactions affect speciation remains largely unknown. Here, we explicitly model the interaction of three key mechanisms (local adaptation, mate choice and genetic hybrid incompatibilities) quantifying their relative contribution to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We modeled two populations exchanging migrants using Fisher Geometric Model for local adaptation, phenotype matching for mate choice, and multiple pairs of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMI). All three mechanisms were determined by the same set of loci, creating conditions for interactions between barriers both at the genetic and population levels. We found no cases where the three barriers evolved. Instead, two barriers could evolve depending on the migration rate: either local adaptation and genetic incompatibilities for limited migration, or local adaptation and mate choice for higher migration. Our results showed that local adaptation due to ecological differentiation was the first to evolve and by far the most effective reproductive barrier. Finally, we demonstrated that in a polygenic model, populations could become locally adapted and evolve strict mate choice, yet they would not accumulate incompatibilities provided that there was sufficient gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

In frogs, however, odontogenesis is delayed, occurring instead during the postembryonic metamorphosis. Nearly all adult frogs have teeth on the upper jaw and lack lower jaw dentition, but a single species re-evolved mandibular teeth. Developmental-genetic mechanisms that underlie tooth formation in frogs are poorly understood, including whether an ancestral program is partially retained in the lower jaw that could facilitate the evolutionary reappearance of lost mandibular teeth. Using a developmental series of an unconventional model species, we assessed 1) if the gene network underlying odontogenic competence is conserved in the late-forming teeth of frogs; 2) if unique keratinized mouthparts, which function as an alternative feeding tool in anuran larvae, impede tooth induction; and 3) if transient tooth rudiments form in the anuran mandible. The tooth development network is conserved in the frog upper jaw, which displays dental expression patterns comparable to those of other vertebrates. There is, however, no evidence of tooth development in the mandible. Teeth emerge before keratinized mouthparts degenerate, but their location may be spatially constrained by keratin, and gene expression patterns of keratinized mouthparts and teeth overlap. We hypothesize that the novel mouthparts of tadpoles did not arise de novo but instead originated by partially co-opting the developmental program that typically mediates true tooth development.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

While the general reaction catalyzed by recombinases is the same in all domains, key differences at the amino acid level can lead to the specialization of this family of proteins. A key example of this is in the domain of Eukarya, which can utilize two different RecA homologs depending on the life cycle stage of the organism, with the activity of Rad51 utilized during mitotic growth and the activity of Dmc1 used during meiosis. Why most eukaryotes utilize two RecA homologs is an open question. A missing piece of information in this story is the identity of RecA homologs before the divergence of Rad51 and Dmc1, which occurred in early eukaryotes. We analyzed sequence data from the Archaeal homolog, RadA, in the Asgard Archaea superphyla. Our findings include evidence for the evolution of a eukaryotic-specific DNA binding site II within the Asgard lineage. We also identify sequence variants within DNA binding loops L1 and L2, part of binding site I, that imply higher mismatch tolerance within the Asgard and DPANN superphylum. These loops are also observed in the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 within Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the last Archaeal ancestor of Rad51 and Dmc1 was more Dmc1-like in character and likely of lower fidelity.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514069

How different immune cell types engage PRR- and guard protein-dependent defenses in response to infection is poorly understood. Here, we show that macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) respond in distinct ways to bacterial virulence activities. In macrophages, the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila deploys its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to deliver effector proteins that facilitate its robust intracellular replication. In contrast, T4SS activity triggers rapid DC death that potently restricts Legionella replication within this cell type. Intriguingly, we found that infected DCs exhibit considerable heterogeneity at the single cell level. Initially, a subset of DCs activate caspase-11 and NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis and release IL-1{beta} early during infection. At later timepoints, a separate DC population undergoes apoptosis driven by T4SS effectors that block host protein synthesis, thereby depleting the levels of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP.

Collectively, our work suggests a model where Mcl-1 and cFLIP guard host translation in DCs, and that macrophages and DCs distinctly employ innate immune sensors and guard proteins to mount divergent responses to Legionella infection.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Here, we present LUNAR, a blind localization method that simultaneously resolves overlapping molecular signals and corrects for aberrations using a neural-physics model. Through self-supervised learning on single-molecule data without requiring prior knowledge or accurate calibration, LUNAR synergistically optimizes a physical model with a neural network to estimate key physical parameters (e.g., 3D positions, photons, aberrations) of molecules. Its hybrid Transformer network effectively handles PSFs of varying sizes, achieving theoretically maximum localization precision of consecutive blinking events. Extensive simulations and experiments demonstrate that LUNAR consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, reducing localization error by up to sixfold in the presence of unknown aberrations and molecular overlaps, enabling high-fidelity whole-cell reconstruction of mitochondria, nucleus, and neuronal cytoskeleton at great depths.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Yet our understanding of value-based decision-making comes primarily from studying individuals in isolation, leaving open fundamental questions about how animals adapt their strategies during social competition. Here, we developed an ethologically relevant multi-player game, in which freely-moving mice make value-based decisions in a competitive spatial foraging task. We found that mice integrate real-time spatial information about  self and the opponent to flexibly shift their preference towards safer, low-payout options when appropriate. Analyses of mice and reinforcement learning agents reveal that these behavioural adaptations cannot be explained by simple reward learning, but are instead consistent with optimal decision strategies guided by opponent features. Using a dynamical model of neural activity, we found that in addition to opponent effects, decisions under competition were also noisier and more sensitive to initial conditions, generating testable predictions for neural recordings and perturbations. Together, this work reveals a fundamental mechanism for competitive foraging, and proposes novel quantitative frameworks towards understanding value-based decision-making in a fast-changing social environment.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

The established protocols for single cells grown on or deposited on EM-grids are not suitable for multicellular plant tissues. Plunge-freezing does not yield vitrified samples in most cases and must be replaced by high-pressure freezing.

However, prioritizing causal common and rare non-coding variants in human disease, and understanding how selective pressures have shaped the non-coding genome, remains a significant challenge. Here, we predicted the effects of 15 million variants with deep learning models trained on single-cell ATAC-seq across 132 cellular contexts in adult and fetal brain and heart, producing nearly two billion context-specific predictions. Using these predictions, we distinguish candidate causal variants underlying human traits and diseases and their context-specific effects. While common variant effects are more cell-type-specific, rare variants exert more cell-type-shared regulatory effects, with selective pressures particularly targeting variants affecting fetal brain neurons. To prioritize de novo mutations with extreme regulatory effects, we developed FLARE, a context-specific functional genomic model of constraint. FLARE outperformed other methods in prioritizing case mutations from autism-affected families near syndromic autism-associated genes; for example, identifying mutation outliers near CNTNAP2 that would be missed by alternative approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of integrating single-cell maps with population genetics and deep learning-based variant effect prediction to elucidate mechanisms of development and disease-ultimately, supporting the notion that genetic contributions to neurodevelopmental disorders are predominantly rare.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

The expression of conserved bilaterian patterning genes in echinoderms provides a molecular framework for resolving this puzzle. Recent studies in juvenile asteroids suggest that the bilaterian antero-posterior axis maps onto the medio-lateral axis that is perpendicular to each of the five rays of the pentaradial body plan. Here we test this hypothesis in another echinoderm class, the ophiuroids, using the cosmopolitan brittle star Amphipholis squamata. Our results show that the general principles of axial patterning are similar to those described in asteroids, and comparisons with existing molecular data from other echinoderm taxa support the idea that medio-lateral deployment of the AP patterning program across the rays predates the evolution of the asterozoan and likely the echinoderm crown-groups. Our data also reveal expression differences between A. squamata and asteroids, which we attribute to secondary modifications specific to ophiuroids.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1s function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Currently, drugs and drug candidates against AR target the steroid-binding domain to antagonize or degrade AR. However, these compounds cannot therapeutically access largely intrinsically disordered truncated splice variants of AR, such as AR-V7, that only possess the DNA binding domain and are missing the ligand binding domain. Targeting intrinsically disordered regions within transcription factors has remained challenging and is considered ""undruggable"". Herein, we leveraged a cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library in a cellular screen to identify degraders of AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. We identified a covalent compound EN1441 that selectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in a proteasome-dependent manner through direct covalent targeting of an intrinsically disordered cysteine C125 in AR and AR-V7. EN1441 causes significant and selective destabilization of AR and AR-V7, leading to aggregation of AR/AR-V7 and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Consistent with targeting both AR and AR-V7, we find that EN1441 completely inhibits total AR transcriptional activity in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells expressing both AR and AR-V7 compared to AR antagonists or degraders that only target the ligand binding domain of full-length AR, such as enzalutamide and ARV-110. Our results put forth a pathfinder molecule EN1441 that targets an intrinsically disordered cysteine within AR to destabilize, degrade, and inhibit both AR and AR-V7 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and highlights the utility of covalent ligand discovery approaches in directly targeting, destabilizing, inhibiting, and degrading classically undruggable transcription factor targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Despite intrinsic links to their oncogenic potential, the fidelity and mechanisms of ecDNA inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we show that ecDNA are protected against cytosolic mis-segregation through mitotic clustering and by tethering to the telomeric and subtelomeric regions of mitotic chromosomes. ecDNA-chromosome tethering depends on BRD4 transcriptional co-activation and mitotic transcription of the long non-coding RNA PVT1, which is co-amplified with MYC in colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Disruption of ecDNA-chromosome tethering through BRD4 inhibition, PVT1 depletion, or inhibiting mitotic transcription results in cytosolic mis-segregation, ecDNA reintegration, and the formation of homogeneously staining regions (HSRs). We propose that nuclear inheritance of ecDNA is facilitated by an RNA-mediated physical tether that links ecDNA to mitotic chromosomes and thus protects against cytosolic mis-segregation and chromosomal integration.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

This approach revealed that the S. aureus cell cycle and chromosome replication cycle are not coupled, with cells exhibiting two segregated origins of replication at the start of the cell cycle. The chromosome has a specific origin-terminus-origin conformation, with origins localizing near the membrane, towards the tip of each hemisphere, or the ""cell poles"".

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3s tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues.

Among these tasks, cell type annotation remains particularly challenging, with researchers exploring various methods to improve accuracy and efficiency. While recent studies on GPT-like models have demonstrated annotation performance comparable to manual annotations, a significant gap remains in understanding their limitations and generalizability. In this work, we compare and evaluate the annotation performance of the GPT-4 model against traditional methods on nine randomly selected public single-cell RNA seq datasets from cellxgene, covering diverse tissue types. Our evaluation highlights the complexity of annotating cell types in single-cell data, revealing key differences between automated and manual approaches. We found specific cases where GPT-4 underperforms, demonstrating its limitations in certain contexts. We further introduce an automated approach to incorporate literature search using a RAG approach which enhances and outperforms GPT-4 cell type annotation when compared to traditional methods. We also introduce metrics based on taxonomic distance in the ontology tree to evaluate the granularity of the cell type annotations. To support future research, we also release an open-source Python package 1 that enables fully automated cell-type annotation of single-cell data using GPT-4 alongside other methods. The pipeline can take paper as an input and do cell type annotations on its own.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

However, how NR5A2 differentially regulates transcriptional networks at distinct developmental stages remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the dynamics of chromatin binding profiles of NR5A2 from the 2-cell to morula stage, which corresponds to the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition. Our NR5A2 CUT&Tag analysis identifies lineage-determining factor KLF and GATA families as co-regulators for NR5A2 in mouse embryos. We find that KLF5 cooperates with NR5A2 to enhance H3K27ac deposition, and NR5A2 predominantly promotes chromatin accessibility. NR5A2 regulates Xist expression either directly or indirectly through its role in up-regulating GATA factor expression. In vitro assays reveal that NR5A2 co-binds to nucleosomes with KLF5 and GATA6, suggesting that these pioneer transcription factors can simultaneously bind to the chromatin. Our findings highlight the role of NR5A2 in ensuring robust gene activation during pre-implantation development through feed-forward regulatory loops with lineage-determining transcription factors.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Stratigraphic intervals help us estimate two important quantities from the fossil record of a given lineage, its origination and extinction times.
C_LIO_LIMany models are available in the literature. This toolset is complemented here by proposing a flexible method which allows to estimate origination and extinction times, as well as model preservation potential in flexible ways.
C_LIO_LIA method is presented for representing the stratigraphic interval as a continuous distribution by integrating over parameter uncertainty throughthe use of the posterior predictive distribution. It is possible then to combine these distributions using conflation, to build a time probabilistic model for the co-occurrence of these intervals.
C_LIO_LIEmpirical examples using Palynomorphs and the origination time of the marine Barracudas are used for illustrating the potential of the method. The methods are implemented in the StratIntervals.jl Julia package, which allows a big amount of possible prior distributions, and MCMC samplers.

This was achieved by electroporation of strains stably expressing a codon-optimized Cas9 with two separate DNA molecules, one encoding a selectable marker flanked by short homology arms and a second encoding a sgRNA under the control of the U6 snRNA promoter. However, the efficiency of desired homology-dependent repair relative to undesired non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) events can be low and variable. Here, we describe methods and strains enabling extremely efficient ([~]99%) homology-dependent genome editing in C. neoformans. This high-efficiency method requires two manipulations. First, we placed the sgRNA-expressing segment into the marker-containing DNA flanked by targeting homology; thus, only a single DNA molecule is introduced into cells. Second, we used a strain mutant for the non-homologous end-joining factor Ku80 (encoded by YKU80). We also report the engineering of a yku80::amdS mutant strain harboring an insertion mutation that can be removed scarlessly via recombination between direct repeats. This enables the functional restoration of YKU80 after homology- dependent genome editing via selection against the amdS marker using fluoroacetamide. This approach minimizes documented drawbacks of using Ku-defective strains in downstream experiments. Finally, we describe a plasmid series that enables rapid cloning of sgRNA-marker constructs for genomic manipulation of C. neoformans, including gene deletion and C-terminal tagging. These methods, strains, and plasmids accelerate the genomic manipulation of C. neoformans.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

However, most flagellated bacteria possess complex motors with unique, species-specific adaptations whose mechanisms and evolution remain largely unexplored 8-10. Here, we deploy a multidisciplinary approach to build a near-complete model of the flagellar motor in Campylobacter jejuni, revealing its remarkable complexity in architecture and composition. We identify an E-ring around the MS-ring, a periplasmic cage with two distinctive conformations, and an intricate interaction network between the E-ring and cage. These scaffolds play critical roles in stabilizing and regulating 17 torque-generating stator complexes for optimal motility. In-depth evolutionary analyses uncover the ancient origin and prevalence of the E-ring in flagellated species of the domain Bacteria as well as a unique exaptation of type IV pili components PilMNOPQF in the ancestral motor of the phylum Campylobacterota. Collectively, our studies reveal novel mechanisms of assembly and function in complex flagellar motors and shed light on the evolution of flagella and modern bacterial species.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

A key part of OM biogenesis is insertion of OM proteins (OMPs) by the {beta}-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM). Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a member of the phylum Bacteroidota that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is radically different from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extensive extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. We find that two of the novel subunits involved in forming the extracellular canopy are essential for BAM function. For one of these subunits isolation of a suppressor mutation allows the separation of their essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the OM of the Bacteroidota.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

However, the microbial factors that influence host longevity and their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Using the expression of Caenorhabditis elegans FAT-7, a stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase, as a proxy for lifespan modulation, we conduct a genome-wide bacterial mutant screen and identify 26 Escherichia coli mutants that enhance host lifespan. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses reveal that these mutant diets induce oxidative stress and activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Lifespan extension requires the oxidative stress response regulators SKN-1, SEK-1, and HLH-30. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to reduced iron availability, as iron supplementation restores FAT-7 expression, suppresses UPRmt activation, and abolishes lifespan extension. Iron chelation mimics the pro-longevity effects of the mutant diets, highlighting dietary iron as a key modulator of aging. Our findings reveal a bacterial-host metabolic axis that links iron homeostasis, oxidative stress, and longevity in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1740348514070

Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1), with its high case fatality rate and potential for adaptation in avian reservoirs, is a prime candidate for triggering such a pandemic. We applied the Viral Trait Assessment for Pandemics (ViTAP) model, a quantitative framework, to assess the pandemic potential of H5N1 strains currently circulating in the United States. Through a systematic literature review and structured expert elicitation involving virologists and epidemiologists, we refined and validated ViTAP scores across 11 key viral traits. The resulting assessment yielded a final ViTAP score of 3.28 out of 5, placing the U.S. H5N1 strains in the moderate-to-high risk category. This elevated risk is driven by the viruss high human fatality rate, its segmented RNA genome enabling reassortment, and its propensity for mutation. Sensitivity analyses highlight the transmission mode of the virus as a critical factor, with even minor increases in human-to-human spread dramatically escalating the pandemic threat. Comparisons with historical pandemics underscore the potential for H5N1 to rival the devastating impact of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for enhanced surveillance in avian and mammalian hosts, targeted vaccine development, and comprehensive pandemic preparedness efforts. By demonstrating the utility of the ViTAP model for pandemic risk assessment, we provide a valuable tool to guide policy and interventions in the face of emerging zoonotic threats.","NA","medrxiv",1740348514070
