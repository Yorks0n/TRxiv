However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1728511743551

While the Iron Age was comparable to contemporary European regions, the gene pool of Central Italy underwent significant influence from Near Eastern ancestry during the Imperial age. To explain this shift, it has been proposed that during this period people from Eastern Mediterranean regions of the Empire migrated towards its political center. In this study, by analyzing a new individual (1.25x) and published Republican samples, we propose a novel perspective for the presence of Near Eastern ancestry in the Imperial gene pool. In our scenario, the spread of this genetic ancestry took place during the late Republican period, predating the onset of the Empire by ~200 years. The diffusion of this ancestry may have occurred due to early East-to-West movements, since Eastern Mediterranean regions were already under Roman political influence during the Republic, or even as a result of migration from Southern Italy where Greeks and Phoenicians settled.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

However, little is known about how this drug alters large-scale brain activity. We collected naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) data of 29 healthy individuals before and after inhaling a high dose (12mg) of vaporised synthetic 5-MeO-DMT. We replicate work from rodents showing amplified low-frequency oscillations, but extend these findings with novel tools for characterising the organisation and dynamics of complex low-frequency spatiotemporal fields of neural activity. We find that 5-MeO-DMT radically reorganises low-frequency flows of neural activity, causing them to become incoherent, heterogeneous, viscous, fleeting, nonrecurring, and to cease their typical travelling forwards and backwards across the cortex compared to resting state. Further, we find a consequence of this reorganisation in broadband activity, which exhibits slower, more stable, low-dimensional behaviour, with increased energy barriers to rapid global shifts. These findings provide the first detailed empirical account of how 5-MeO-DMT sculpts human brain dynamics, revealing a novel set of cortical slow wave behaviours, with significant implications for extant neuroscientific models of serotonergic psychedelics.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

The SEAC acts as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Gtr1, a small GTPase that forms a heterodimer with Gtr2, and as part of the EGO complex (EGOC), relays nutrient signals to TORC1. The SEAC is composed of two subcomplexes, SEACIT, an inhibitor of TORC1 that contains the GAP activity, and SEACAT, that has been proposed to regulate the activity of SEACIT. However, molecular details of its regulation are unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SEAC-EGOC supercomplex and studied its function in TORC1 amino acid signalling. A single SEAC can interact with two EGOC molecules via SEACIT, binding exclusively to the ""active"" version of the EGOC as their interaction depends on Gtr1 being loaded with GTP. SEACAT does not modulate nor interact with the EGOC. The GAP activity of the SEAC is essential for the regulation of TORC1 by amino acids, and its loss phenocopies the lack of Gtr1-Gtr2, establishing the SEAC-EGOC complex as an amino acid-sensing hub. Despite being located far from the active site, deletion of Sea2, or its N-terminal {beta}-propeller domain, also results in defects in amino acid signalling to TORC1. We propose that the SEAC-EGOC supercomplex integrates coatomer-like mechanisms of regulation via bidirectional feedback between GAP-GTPase (SEACIT-EGOC) and coat (SEACAT) modules that explain the functional interaction between Sea2 and the GAP activity. Given the conservation between the SEAC and its mammalian ortholog GATOR, we envision that this mechanism is similar in different organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Altogether, we identified 133 probands with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in RNU4-2 and 15 individuals with de novo and/or recurrent variants in constrained regions of RNU5B-1, one of five genes encoding U5. These variants cluster in evolutionarily conserved regions of U4 and U5 essential for splicing. RNU4-2 variants affecting stem III are associated with milder phenotypes than those in the T-loop (quasi-pseudoknot). Phaseable variants associated with severe phenotypes occurred on the maternal allele. Individuals with RNU4-2 variants show specific defects in alternative 5' splice site usage, correlating with variant location and clinical severity. Additionally, we report an episignature associated with severe ReNU syndrome. This study further highlights the importance of de novo variants in snRNAs and establishes RNU5B-1 as a new neurodevelopmental disorder gene.","NA","medrxiv",1728511743551

Epigenetic clocks measure aging but require DNA methylation data, which many studies lack. Using data from the Dunedin Study, we introduce an accurate and reliable measure for the rate of longitudinal aging derived from cross-sectional brain MRI: the Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated from NeuroImaging or DunedinPACNI. Exporting this measure to the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and UK Biobank neuroimaging datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted participants cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Underscoring close links between longitudinal aging of the body and brain, faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases, and mortality in older adults. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI followed the expected socioeconomic health gradient. When compared to brain age gap, an existing MRI aging biomarker, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes. DunedinPACNI is a ""next generation"" MRI measure that will be made publicly available to the research community to help accelerate aging research and evaluate the effectiveness of dementia prevention and anti-aging strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

We find that the combined area-condition BNG metric does not capture the value of arable farmland and grassland sites for invertebrate biodiversity: invertebrate communities were highly variable across sites that had the same type and condition under the BNG metric. There was no significant relationship between invertebrate abundance or species richness and metric scores. Our results highlight the need to incorporate factors beyond habitat type and condition into site evaluations, and to complement metric use with species-based surveys.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

In this study, we describe our approach for designing stable mRNA molecules by combining machine learning-driven sequence design with high-throughput experimental assays. We developed a high-throughput massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) that, in a single experiment, measures the half-life of tens of thousands of unique mRNA sequences containing designed 3' UTRs. Over multiple design-build-test iterations, we have accumulated 180,000 unique measurements of mRNA stability covering unique genomic and synthetic 3' UTRs, representing the largest such dataset of sequences. We trained highly-accurate machine learning models to map from 3' UTR sequence to mRNA stability, and used them to guide the design of synthetic 3' UTRs that increase mRNA stability in cell lines. Finally, we validated the function of several ML-designed 3' UTRs in mouse models, resulting in up to 2-fold more protein production over time and 30--100-fold higher protein output at later time points compared to a commonly used benchmark. These results highlight the potential of ML-driven sequence design for mRNA therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

While traditionally viewed as a waste product, lactate is an important energy source for many organs, but first must be oxidized to pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). This reaction is thought to occur in the cytosol, with pyruvate subsequently transported into mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Using 13C stable isotope tracing, we demonstrated that lactate is oxidized in the myocardial tissue of mice even when the MPC is genetically deleted. This MPC-independent lactate import and mitochondrial oxidation is dependent upon the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1/Slc16a1). Mitochondria isolated from the myocardium without MCT1 exhibit a specific defect in mitochondrial lactate, but not pyruvate, metabolism. The import and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation of lactate by mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) acts as an electron shuttle, generating sufficient NADH to support respiration even when the TCA cycle is disrupted. In response to diverse cardiac insults, animals with hearts lacking MCT1 undergo rapid progression to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Thus, the mitochondrial import and oxidation of lactate enables carbohydrate entry into the TCA cycle to sustain cardiac energetics and maintain myocardial structure and function under stress conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

A total of 462 papers were curated, leading to 54,666 mutation entries all classified with the degree of evidence that supports their role in resistance. FungAMR covers 92 species, 202 genes and 184 drugs. We combined variant effect predictors with FungAMR resistance mutations and showed that these tools could be used to help predict the potential impact of mutations on AMR. Additionally, a comparative analysis among species revealed a high level of convergence in the molecular basis of resistance, revealing some potentially universal resistance mutations. The analysis also showed that a significant number of resistance mutations lead to cross-resistance within antifungals of a class, as well as between classes for certain mutated genes. The acquisition of fungal resistance in the clinic and the field is an urging concern.

Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and utilizes similar structural folds. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes however differs between eukaryotic kingdoms. The TPLATE complex in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several endocytic folds into a single octameric protein complex. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation, and its requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here, we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPLATE complex. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences.

Although proposed decades ago, experimental evidence of a titration-based control mechanism is still lacking. Here, we first identified a conserved high-density region of binding motifs near the origin of replication, an advantageous trait for titration of DnaA. We then investigated the mobility of DnaA by single-particle tracking microscopy in wild-type and deletion mutants E. coli strains, while monitoring cellular size and DNA content. Our results indicate that the chromosome of E. coli controls the free amount of DnaA in a growth rate-dependent fashion.

Lactate-derived histone lactylation has recently been identified as an important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of gene expression across various biological processes. In this study, we report an increase in global histone lactylation and H3K18Lac levels in the mesenchyme and osteoblasts of the zebrafish caudal fin, during the early stages of regeneration. Our findings demonstrate that this epigenetic modification is functionally regulated by increased lactate levels, while inhibition of glycolysis and lactate production significantly reduces histone lactylation. These results suggest that metabolic reprogramming, in response to caudal fin injury, regulates histone lactylation, potentially modulating gene expression essential for cell plasticity and proliferation. This study expands our understanding of how metabolic-epigenetic interactions influence regenerative processes, providing valuable insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue repair.

This isolation, combined with substantial Denisovan ancestry, contributes to the unique genetic makeup of the Papua New Guinean population. Previous research suggested the possibility of admixture with an early diverged modern human population, but the extent of this contribution remains debated. This study re-examines the demographic history of the Papua New Guinean population using newly published samples and advanced analytical methods. Our findings demonstrate that the observed shifts in relative cross coalescent rate curves are unlikely to result from technical artefacts or contributions from an earlier out of Africa population. Instead, they are likely due to a significant bottleneck and slower population growth rate within the Papua New Guinean population. Our analysis positions the Papua New Guinean population as a sister group to other Asian populations, challenging the notion of Papua New Guinean as an outgroup to both European and Asian populations.

We systematically analyzed the developmental role of an expanded TTR family of proteins, structurally analogous to mammalian thyroid hormone-transporting Transthyretin, and identified three paralogous proteins, TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17, differentially expressed in somatic cells of the gonads and secreted around gametes in C. elegans. Simultaneous inactivation of TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17 leads to a rapid reduction in reproductive capacity in middle age. While oocyte and sperm production remain unaffected in the triple mutants, late-onset infertility results from stalled ovulation. Mechanistically, the absence of TTR-15, TTR-16, and TTR-17 causes sperm to prematurely deplete the cytoplasmic pool of major sperm protein (MSP), released via non-conventional vesicle budding as a signal for ovulation. We propose that the somatic gonads play a central role in maintaining sperm integrity post-production and determining the duration of the reproductive age.

Dopamine and GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in reward and punishment learning, yet little is known about how each population adapts when the predicted outcome valence changes. We measured VTA dopamine and GABA population activity while male and female rats learned to associate three discrete auditory cues to three distinct outcomes: reward, punishment, or no outcome within the same session. After learning, the reward and punishment cue-outcome contingencies were reversed, and subsequently re-reversed. As expected, the dopamine population rapidly adapted to learning and contingency reversals by increasing the response to appetitive stimuli and decreasing the response to aversive stimuli. In contrast, the GABA population increased activity to all sensory events regardless of valence, including the neutral cue. Reversing learned contingencies selectively influenced GABA responses to the reward-predictive cue, prolonging increased activity within and across sessions. The observed valence-specific dissociations in the directionality and temporal progression of VTA dopamine and GABA calcium activity indicates that these populations are independently recruited and serve distinct roles during appetitive and aversive associative learning and contingency reversal.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

However, the biocultural origins of fermentation practices and microbes have largely been replaced by industrial processes. Here, we consider a historical fermentation originating from Turkey and Bulgaria - ant yogurt. We revisit the traditional practices and modern gastronomic applications that use red wood ants (Formica rufa group) to initiate milk fermentation. Subsequently, we characterize the ants and experimental ant-derived yogurts. We uncover that the ant holobiont, which consists of the ants and their microbes, contributes key acids and enzymes to fermentation. Metabarcoding and culturing revealed that lactic and acetic acid bacteria, including species related to those in conventional yogurt and sourdough, originate from the live ants and proliferate in the milk. The ants and bacteria consequently introduce formic, lactic, and acetic acid, advantageous for yogurt acidification and coagulation. Last, proteases with the potential to act on casein and alter yogurt texture are produced by the ants and bacteria. The ant holobiont thus facilitates fermentation akin to the microbial consortia in other ferments. Our findings highlight the value of integrating traditional, gastronomic, and biological frameworks to uncover the origins and applications of microbes for fermented foods.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

However, many eukaryotic viruses, including amoeba-infecting mimiviruses, have codon usage that is largely deviated from that of their host, despite using the host machinery for translation. This raises the question of how these viruses cope with the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand. Here we show that Acanthamoeba castellanii mimivirus generates a subcellular area in the host cells to translate virus mRNAs. A combination of genome-wide ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing showed that ribosomes traversed along viral mRNAs with fewer pausing events than were observed on amoeba mRNAs. Frequently used codons in viral mRNAs had higher tRNA accessibility than the same type of codons in amoeba mRNAs. tRNA sequencing showed that the tRNA pool was not greatly altered during the infection even though the virus encodes tRNA genes. Instead, by in situ labelling, we found that viral mRNAs and newly synthesized proteins were localized at the periphery region of the viral factory, likely creating a unique environment to facilitate viral translation. Our data provide a perspective on how local translation assists the virus in overcoming the mismatch between tRNA supply and demand.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

The importance of PTEN signaling is evident from the broad spectrum of human pathologies associated with its loss of function. Moreover, loss or gain of PTEN function in animal models leads to aberrant cellular morphology, function, and metabolic regulation. However, despite the important role of PTEN signaling, there is currently no method to dynamically monitor its activity with cellular specificity within intact biological systems. Here, we describe the development of a novel PTEN biosensor, optimized for two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). This biosensor is designed to measure PTEN activity within intact cells, tissues, and organisms. Our approach is based on monitoring FRET-dependent changes in PTEN conformation, which serves as a proxy for the activity state in living cells. We identify a point mutation that allow us to express this biosensor with minimal interference to endogenous PTEN signaling and cellular function. We demonstrate the utility of imaging PTEN signaling in cell lines, developing C. elegans, and in the living mouse brain. To complement this approach, we developed a red-shifted PTEN sensor variant that permits simultaneous imaging with GFP-based sensors. Finally, we use in vivo PTEN imaging in the mouse brain to identify cell-type specific dynamics of PTEN activity in excitatory and inhibitory cortical cells. In summary, our approach enables dynamic imaging of PTEN activity in vivo with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Results showed that SSSEP in the very early window was smaller in the no-delay and active conditions compared to the delayed and passive condition, respectively, consistent with sensory attenuation.

Meanwhile, the models that induce OA in young animals through surgical, pharmacological, or genetic alterations fail to mimic OA that stems with age. In this study, we examined the molecular, cellular, and radiological changes in the articular cartilage (AC) of the C57BL/6J wild-type mice from postnatal day 15 to 3 years of age. In juvenile mice, AC, while all the layers express the BMPR1A receptor, only a thin layer of cells in the deep zone of AC express BMP ligands, and chondrocyte hypertrophy ensues first in this layer. With age, the BMP ligands expression domain expands throughout the AC, leading to BMP signaling activation and resultant chondrocyte hypertrophy. Further, exposure to healthy AC with BMP ligands was sufficient to induce premature OA-like changes in the young adult mice, suggesting BMP signaling is the limiting factor behind age-induced OA. We found that activation of BMP signaling upregulates ICAT expression, a known inhibitor of the canonical Wnt pathway in the AC. Our results suggest that with aging, the spread of BMP signaling throughout the cartilage is a certainty and the underlying cause for age-induced OA. Further, in situ inhibition of BMP signaling appears to be a potent therapeutic strategy for age-induced OA.

SignificanceContrived models fail to mimic age-induced osteoarthritis (OA), which poses a challenge to comprehending the molecular mechanisms and thereby developing an effective therapy. We examined cellular and molecular interplay during aging mouse articular cartilage. Our results reveal that in the juvenile stage, expression of BMP ligands and thereby BMP signaling-induced hypertrophy is restricted to the deep zone of articular cartilage. However, with age, BMP ligands begin to express in the entire tissue and trigger BMP signaling, which inhibits ICAT-mediated Wnt-{beta}-catenin signaling to promote chondrocyte hypertrophy resulting in articular cartilage degeneration. Thus, our study provides a previously unknown molecular insight into BMP ligand/signaling dynamics during articular cartilage degeneration and therefore could help develop an effective therapy for age-induced osteoarthritis.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Here we identify a population of local neurons in the fan-shaped body of Drosophila that exhibits both evidence integration and working memory dynamics. Imaging from these neurons during virtual odor-guided navigation reveals a bump of activity that is activated by odor, but can outlast the odor stimulus by several seconds. Persistent bump activity is associated with persistent movement in the direction adopted during odor, arguing that these neurons represent a directional working memory. When the fly navigates a virtual odor plume, bump activity slowly ramps up with successive odor encounters, indicating that it integrates odor information over time. We do not observe these dynamics in a set of neighboring local neurons, although both populations show slow modulation correlated with engagement in the task. Silencing the first population impairs the integration of odor encounters and the persistence of upwind heading. Our work identifies a small group of genetically-identified neurons that integrate and store stochastic sensory evidence to support navigation in complex natural environments.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Transient expression of Rbfox proteins in radial glia progenitors induces neuronal splicing events preferentially in transcription regulators such as Meis2 and Tead1.

However, how fibroblast precursors are guided to diverse tissues remain poorly understood. Using zebrafish, our lab has previously shown that sclerotome-derived cells undergo extensive migration to generate distinct fibroblasts subtypes, including tenocytes along the myotendinous junction and fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold. Interestingly, the pan-fibroblast gene platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (pdgfra), which has been implicated in cell migration across various contexts, is specifically expressed in the sclerotome and its descendants. Loss of functional Pdgfra in a pdgfra gene-trap mutant results in severe defects in the migration of sclerotome- derived cells, leading to a dose-dependent loss of tenocytes and fin mesenchymal cells. By combining live imaging and mosaic labeling with a membrane-bound dominant-negative tool, we demonstrate that Pdgfra acts cell-autonomously to regulate the migration of sclerotome- derived cells. In the absence of ligand pdgfab, which is expressed in the medial somite, sclerotome-derived cells fail to migrate medially, resulting in a loss of tenocytes, although they can migrate normally toward the fin fold and generate fin mesenchymal cells. Strikingly, localized expression of Pdgfab in pdgfab mutants can direct the migration of sclerotome- derived cells to both normal and ectopic locations, suggesting a chemoattractive role for the Pdgfab ligand. Together, our results demonstrate that Pdgfab/Pdgfra-mediated chemoattraction guides the migration of sclerotome-derived fibroblast precursors to specific locations, where they diversify into distinct fibroblast subtypes.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Sclerotome progenitors exhibit transient bmp4 expression and an active response to BMP signaling. Using BMP gain- and loss-of-function tools, we demonstrate that BMP signaling is both necessary and sufficient for sclerotome induction. Furthermore, through mosaic expression of a dominant-negative tool, we show that BMP signaling induces sclerotome fate in a cell-autonomous manner. Interestingly, different populations of sclerotome-derived cells have distinct BMP signaling requirements. Sclerotome-derived notochord-associated cells in the trunk lack BMP response, and sustained BMP signaling inhibits their differentiation into tenocytes. By contrast, sclerotome-derived fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold require high levels of BMP signaling for proper morphogenesis.

From birth, tendons undergo dramatic changes from a principally cellular tissue to a hypocellular one characterized by a dense and highly ordered extracellular matrix. During this time, tendon cells change morphology from rounded to stellate in appearance and their proliferative rates decline. There is also significant expansion and maturation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as tendons grow in length and diameter and alter their biomechanical properties to sustain increased physical activities. Surprisingly, for such an important stage of tendon maturation, we understand very little about the transcriptional and epigenetic regulators that direct these processes. Here, we present a roadmap of genes that are differentially regulated during the early neonatal and postnatal time period. We find differentially expressed genes fall into specific transcriptional modules, representing expression increases, decreases, or gene sets undergoing dynamic changes over postnatal time. By pairing our transcriptomic data with epigenetic data, we were able to perform an integrative analysis of the datasets and further define modules with highly correlated changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. From this analysis, several new pathways emerge. Among them, we focus on Yap1, a transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo signaling pathway. We observe accessible regions near to differentially expressed genes, containing motifs for TEAD, the transcription factor that binds Yap to regulate transcription. Conditional loss of Yap1 at postnatal stages results in altered expression of Col1a1 and disrupted matrix organization and density, suggesting that Yap is important for refining tendon ECM maturation. Together, our analyses identify a regulator of matrix maturation and provides a rich dataset with which to interrogate transcriptional networks and pathways during this poorly understood time in tendon growth.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

We adapted the SunTag-based single-molecule translation imaging system for use in Caenorhabditis elegans and showed the dynamics and importance of localized erm-1 translation during development.

Amplitude properties of predator cues are widely used by prey to assess predation risk, yet rarely studied in the context of the stimuli relevant to defensive decisions in nature. Red-eyed treefrog embryos, Agalychnis callidryas, hatch precociously in response to attacks on their arboreal egg clutches by snakes and wasps. They use vibrations excited during attacks to detect predators, but wind and rainstorms also excite intense vibrations. Past work has demonstrated that to avoid costly decision errors, A. callidryas non-redundantly combine information from the temporal and frequency properties of clutch vibrations. Here we demonstrate that embryos also use absolute amplitude and fine-scale amplitude modulation information to refine their hatching decision. We used vibration recordings to characterize the amplitude properties of the most common predator and benign-source disturbances to A. callidryas egg clutches in nature and tested whether embryos at three ages across the onset of mechanosensory-cued hatching (4-6 days) respond to amplitude variation during playback of synthetic vibrations to eggs. Older embryos responded to much lower-amplitude vibrations, reflecting a >88-fold decrease in response threshold from 4 to 5 days. To assess how embryos combine amplitude with other vibration properties, we played embryos recorded exemplars of snake attack and rain vibrations of varying amplitudes and patterns of amplitude modulation. The amplitude response curve was steeper for snake recordings than for rain. While amplitude information alone is insufficient to discriminate predator attack from benign-source vibrations, A. callidryas employ an impressively complex strategy combining absolute amplitude, amplitude modulation, temporal, and frequency information for their hatching decision.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Telomerase counteracts telomere shortening and is a component of the stem cell DNA repair system that is regulated by ATM and ATR kinases. Here, we report that the DNA repair enzyme APEX2, but not its close paralog APEX1, is required for efficient telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene expression in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and a melanoma cell line. We also observed that APEX2 knockdown significantly diminished telomerase enzyme activity. While APEX1 is known to regulate certain transcription factors, APEX2 has not been reported to influence gene expression. To gain insight into how APEX2 influences gene expression, we conducted RNA-seq following APEX2 knockdown in hESC. These results indicated that a number of genes, in addition to TERT, relied on APEX2 for efficient expression. Genes affected by APEX2 knockdown were significantly enriched for specific repetitive DNA families. These include mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs) and Alu elements. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the highest APEX2 binding near MIR sequences in TERT intron 2. Surprisingly, binding was low in the TERT proximal promoter, a region known to control TERT transcription. MIR and other repetitive DNA regions are common sites of DNA damage, suggesting that APEX2 recruitment and repair of TERT MIR sequences may play a role in influencing TERT expression. This new role for APEX2 in promoting efficient gene expression deepens our understanding of an emerging cancer therapeutic target. Further, as the TERT gene plays critical roles in stem cell maintenance, organismal development and aging, as well as in short telomere disorders and cancer, our observations provide insight into new strategies to modulate the expression of this important enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

This connection is required to generate functional nephrons by providing a pathway for excretion of metabolic waste and byproducts. Currently, methods for differentiating human pluripotent stem cells into kidney organoids generate nephrons that lack CDs and instead terminate as blind-ended tubules. Here we describe a developmentally inspired system that addresses this deficiency through assembly of induced nephrogenic mesenchyme with ureteric bud (UB) tissues, the embryonic building blocks of the kidneys collecting system. The UB progenitors grow and develop into a network of CDs within the organoid, and importantly, they functionally integrate with the nephrons through recapitulating fusion between the distal tubule and CD to create a continuous epithelial lumen. We further showed that proximal-distal nephron specification, fusion frequency, and maturation of the CD can be augmented through temporal manipulation of developmental signaling pathways. This work provides a platform for interrogating the principles and mechanisms underlying nephron-UB fusion and a framework for engineering unobstructed nephrons with patterned collecting systems, an important step toward the de novo generation of functional kidney tissue.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Most established cannabis micropropagation systems rely on shoot proliferation using modal explants that need them to be maintained in vegetative growth, which is not possible for day-neutral genotypes. Floral reversion, the process by which plants revert to vegetative growth from the generative stage, has been demonstrated as an alternative and potentially more efficient approach to the micropropagation of photoperiodic cannabis. The current study investigated if this process could be adapted to facilitate the micropropagation of day-neutral genotypes and overcome existing barriers. During the process, various factors such as photoperiod and light intensity may influence the efficiency of floral reversion. To evaluate this approach in day-neutral cultivars, various photoperiods were compared to assess the impact on reversion rate and subsequent growth. Excised florets obtained from in vitro day-neutral C. sativa cv. ""Blue Auto Mazar x auto Blueberry"" seedlings were subjected to five photoperiods including 12.0, 16.0, 18.0, 20.0, and 24.0 hours of light per day for four weeks. Reversion rates and time, shoot length, shoot number, and node number were measured. Statistical analyses revealed significant differences (p-values < 0.05) in terms of reversion time among photoperiod treatments. The highest reversion rate happened under the 16.0 hr photoperiod with 72% success. The highest shoot lengths were observed under 20.0 hr of photoperiods with a mean of 10.1 mm and the lowest shoot length belonged to 12.0 hr of photoperiods with a mean of 5.6 mm, respectively. Reverted shoots developed vegetatively for some time before initiating new flowers. However, during this period the shoots were successfully rooted in vitro and then acclimated to the growth chamber where they completed their life cycle, including seed production. This process was also successfully achieved from a 2-year old culture of C. sativa cv. ""Blue Auto Mazar"", demonstrating that it is feasible to use this approach for long term culture maintenance and multiplication. This study demonstrates that floral reversion can successfully be used to clonally propagate day-neutral cannabis plants and serves as a basis for developing large-scale clonal propagation and breeding strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

This mutation rate is similar to rates measured in vertebrates with similar generation times and longevity to abalone, and higher than mutation rates measured in faster-reproducing invertebrates. We use our estimated rate to infer baseline effective population sizes (Ne) across multiple Pacific abalone and find that abalone persisted over most of their evolutionary history as large and stable populations, in contrast to extreme fluctuations over recent history and small census sizes in the present day. We then use our mutation rate to infer the timing and pattern of evolution of the abalone genus Haliotis, which was previously unknown due to few fossil calibrations.

In vertebrates, Hh signal transduction depends on the primary cilium where Gli is thought to be activated at the ciliary tip, but the underlying mechanism has remained poorly understood. Our previous study showed that two Unc-51-like kinase (Ulk) family members Ulk4 and Stk36 colocalize with Gli2 at ciliary tip to promote Gli2 phosphorylation upon Shh stimulation, and that ciliary tip localization of Ulk4/Stk36 depends on phosphorylation of Ulk4 by Stk36 (Zhou et al. 2023). Here we show that phosphorylation of Ulk4 drives its phase separation to form biomolecular condensates that recruit Stk36 and Gli2. Mechanistically, Stk36-mediated phosphorylation of Ulk4 promotes its SUMOylation in response to Shh, and subsequent interaction between SUMO and a SUMO-Interacting-Motif (SIM) in the C-terminal region of Ulk4 drives Ulk4 self-assembly to form biomolecular condensates. Phospho-mimetic mutation of Ulk4 sufficed to drive Ulk4/Stk36/Gli2 condensation at ciliary tip, resulting in constitutive Shh pathway activation. Taken together, our results suggest that phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation of Ulk4 promotes kinase-substrate condensation at ciliary tip to transduce the Hh signal. We speculate that phase separation driven by phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation may represent a general mechanism for kinase-mediated signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Yet how bacteria evolve in nature, in more complex multi-species communities, is both challenging to study and essential to our understanding of ecosystem responses to rapid anthropogenic change. It has been theorized that selection purges within-species diversity in genome-wide selective sweeps, but the prevalence of such sweeps in response to known selective pressures in nature remains unclear. To track bacterial evolution in a semi-natural context, we applied Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) as a selective pressure to 1000 L ponds containing bacterioplankton communities from a pristine lake. Using metagenomic analyses, we found that GBH treatment substantially affected community diversity, reducing species richness twofold, but did not consistently purge within-species genetic diversity over the four weeks of the experiment. We identified several functional categories of genes targeted by GBH selection across 11 different species of bacteria. There was no evidence for selection on the enzyme targeted by glyphosate, which interferes with amino acid synthesis; however genes involved more broadly in amino acid transport and metabolism were more likely to experience changes in allele frequency, particularly in inferred GBH-sensitive species. Together, these results show how environmental change can rapidly affect bacterial community structure while leaving within-species diversity largely intact. Even without evident genome-wide selective sweeps, we identify consistent genetic targets of selection, pointing to alternative mechanisms of GBH resistance in nature, and suggesting a role for soft or gene-specific selective sweeps in adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

We have developed a codon optimized CRISPRi/a for zebrafish; here we provide proof-of-principle data across established pigmentary and growth phenotypes. We established a zebrafish codon-optimized cas9 gene, harboring mutations D10A and D839A to render the protein catalytically inactive (dCas9). Similarly, codon-optimized Kruppel associated box (KRAB) and methylated CP2 (MeCP2) inactivating domains or VP64 activator domain were cloned downstream from dCas9 for CRISPRi and CRISPRa, respectively. To validate CRISPRi, we targeted key genes in melanocyte differentiation (sox10, mitfa, and mitfb); and melanin production (tyrosinase; tyr). Microinjection of CRISPRi mRNA and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the tyr promoter or 5-UTR resulted in larvae with hypopigmented epidermal melanocytes. Transcription factors mitfa and mitfb similarly direct differentiation and pigmentation of epidermal melanocytes (mitfa) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE, mitfb). CRISPRi-mediated targeting of their promoters or 5-UTR also results in pronounced hypopigmentation of epidermal melanocytes (mitfa), and RPE (mitfb). So too, targeting CRISPRi to the sox10 promoter results in hypopigmentation of both epidermal melanocytes and RPE consistent with its role upstream of mitfa and mitfb, and tyr. Finally, we asked whether CRISPRi and CRISPRa could be used to modulate a single gene, to yield hypomorphic and hypermorphic effects, selecting mrap2a, as our target. This gene regulates energy homeostasis and somatic growth via inhibition of the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (mc4r). We demonstrate that targeting the mrap2a 5-UTR with CRISPRa or CRISPRi significantly increases or decreases larval body length, respectively. We demonstrate the utility of CRISPRi/a for modulating control of zebrafish gene expression, facilitating efficient assay of candidate gene function and disease relevance.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

To understand the factors that control evolutionary repeatability, we experimentally evolved four replicate hybrid populations of sunflowers at natural sites for up to 14 years and tracked ancestry across the genome. We found that there was very strong negative selection against introgressed ancestry in several chromosomes, but positive selection for introgressed ancestry in one chromosome. Further, the strength of selection was influenced by recombination rate. High recombination regions had lower selection against introgressed ancestry due to more frequent recombination away from incompatible backgrounds. Strikingly, evolution was highly parallel across replicates, with shared selection driving 88% of variance in introgressed allele frequency change. Parallel evolution was driven by both high levels of sustained linkage in introgressed alleles and strong selection on large-effect quantitative trait loci. This work highlights the repeatability of evolution through hybridization and confirms the central roles that natural selection, genomic architecture, and recombination play in the process.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), alternative alleles at the gene vgll3 have been found to associate with a large proportion of the variation in maturation age, yet the molecular and physiological mechanisms of this association are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which genetic variation in this major age-at-maturity gene translated into phenotypic variation. We established a time series of gonadal vgll3 mRNA expression in male and female Atlantic salmon in a common garden setting, starting at the prepubertal stage and spanning multiple spawning seasons. We found that vgll3 mRNA expression is reduced in early-maturing males and females. However, for the second spawning season, vgll3 expression increased with gonadal development in males, but eventually decreased in females. Expression of vgll3 had context-dependent correlations with expression of amh and lhr. We also found signs of reduced testicular vgll3 expression in a low-fat feed treatment. By significantly widening the scope of our knowledge on temporal vgll3 expression dynamics, our results exemplify that major-effect genes may use different pathways in sexes but achieve similar outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

This complex phenomenon is driven by precise spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression across many cells, resulting in the emergence of highly organized tissue structures. While similar emergent behavior is well understood in other fields, such as statistical mechanics, the regulation of gene expression in development remains less clear, particularly regarding how molecular-level gene interactions lead to the large-scale patterns observed in embryos. In this study, we present a modeling framework that bridges the gap between molecular gene regulation and tissue-level embryonic patterning. Beginning with basic chemical reaction models of transcription at the single-gene level, we progress to model gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that mediate specific cellular functions. We then introduce phenomenological models of pattern formation, including the French Flag and Temporal Patterning/Speed Regulation models, and integrate them with molecular/GRN realizations. A key feature of our framework is the explicit articulation of underlying assumptions at each level of the model, from transcriptional regulation to tissue patterning. By making these assumptions clear, we provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical work to critically examine and challenge them, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of gene regulatory models in developmental biology. As a case study, we explore how different strategies for integrating enhancer activity affect the robustness and evolvability of gene expression patterns in embryonic development. Our simulations suggest that a two-step regulation strategy--enhancer activation followed by competitive integration at the promoter--ensures more standardized integration of new enhancers into developmental GRNs, highlighting the adaptability of eukaryotic transcription. These findings provide new insights into the transcriptional mechanisms underlying embryonic patterning, offering a framework for future experimental and theoretical investigations.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

We performed transcriptome and metabolome analyses on the collected samples at each stage. Through KEGG enrichment analysis, it was found that the phytohormone signal transduction, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways play a significant role in regulating bulbil initiation and development.

They undergo co-adaptation, allowing evolution to work on several genes to refine complex phenotypes, giving supergenes a competitive edge. Yet, due to their lack of recombination, supergenes are susceptible to deterioration as they cannot efficiently purge deleterious DNA. Few examples outside of sex chromosomes have been available for study. Here, we present the first assembly of the t haplotype, a 33.4 Mb supergene in house mice that 'selfishly' transmits itself at non-Mendelian frequencies. We characterize the four large non-overlapping inversions that make up the t haplotype. We compare in a t/t individual two different t variants with different recessive lethal phenotypes (age at death). Despite that difference, they differ much less from each other than the rest of the chromosome. However, the differences that they have were much more likely to be deleterious than the differences between the two variants of the rest of the chromosome. We interpret this marked difference as evidence of the accumulation of deleterious variants, a hallmark of deterioration. The t region of chromosome 17 is more distant to the reference than the rest of the chromosome, and has a higher fraction of impactful differences here as well. Thus, we conclude that the t appears as a quickly spreading and deteriorating selfish supergene, a rare example of Muller's ratchet outside of sex chromosomes. Furthermore, we aim for our assembly to provide a resource for comparative work on the t haplotype, such as its evolutionary history.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Sox10 deficit causes aganglionosis, modeling Hirschsprung disease, and disrupts ratios of postnatal enteric neurons in proximal ganglionated bowel. How Sox10 deficiency alters ratios of enteric neuron subtypes is unclear. Sox10s prominent expression in enteric neural crest-derived progenitors (ENCP) and lack of this gene in enteric neurons led us to examine Sox10Dom effects ENS progenitors and early differentiating enteric neurons.

MethodsENS progenitors, developing neurons, and enteric glia were isolated from Sox10+/+ and Sox10Dom/+ littermates for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). scRNA-seq data was processed to identify cell type-specific markers, differentially expressed genes, cell fate trajectories, and gene regulatory network activity between genotypes. Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) validated expression changes detected in scRNA-seq.

ResultsscRNA-seq profiles revealed three neuronal lineages emerging from cycling progenitors via two transition pathways accompanied by elevated activity of Hox gene regulatory networks (GRN) as progenitors transition to neuronal fates. Sox10Dom/+ scRNA-seq profiles exhibited a novel progenitor cluster, decreased abundance of cells in transitional states, and shifts in cell distributions between two neuronal trajectories. Hoxa6 was differentially expressed in the neuronal lineages impacted in Sox10Dom/+mutants and HCR identified altered Hoxa6 expression in early developing neurons of Sox10Dom/+ ENS.

ConclusionsSox10Dom/+ mutation shifts enteric neuron types by altering neuronal trajectories during early ENS lineage segregation. Multiple neurogenic transcription factors are reduced in Sox10Dom/+ scRNA-seq profiles including multiple Hox genes. This is the first report that implicates Hox genes in lineage diversification of enteric neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Specification of the vulva cell fates requires coordination between cell division and cell signaling via LIN-12/Notch and LET-23/EGFR pathways in the somatic gonad and the underlying epithelium. Here we characterize the positive regulation of vulval development by the centralspindlin complex, a conserved cytokinesis regulator. Centralspindlin, a heterotetramer of ZEN-4/KIF23 and CYK-4/RacGAP1, is essential for completion of cytokinesis during early embryonic cell divisions. We found that centralspindlin is required in the somatic gonad for division of somatic gonad precursor cells and hence specification of the LIN-3/EGF-secreting anchor cell critical for LET-23/EGFR-mediated vulval induction. However, the requirements for centralspindlin for cytokinesis during postembryonic development are incomplete as a binucleate anchor cell is frequently specified. The presence of the binucleate anchor cell correlates with vulva induction and demonstrates that LIN-12/Notch signaling, required for anchor cell specification, and LET-23/EGFR signaling, required for vulva induction, is largely functional in these cells. Centralspindlin is also partially required for cytokinesis of the vulval cells where it regulates vulva morphogenesis rather than induction. We also found that the GAP domain of CYK-4/RacGAP1 required for contractile ring assembly during embryonic division is not essential for vulval development. Thus, there appears to be different requirements for centralspindlin during postembryonic development of the somatic gonad and vulva as compared to early embryogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

We generated RFX3 knockout (RFX3 KO) iPSC lines using CRISPR/Cas9 and differentiated them into pancreatic islet organoids. Various techniques were employed to assess gene expression, cell markers, apoptosis, proliferation, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from hESC-derived pancreatic islets were re-analyzed to investigate RFX3 expression in specific cell populations at various developmental stages. Furthermore, bulk RNA sequencing was conducted to further assess transcriptomic changes. RFX3 was found to be highly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cell populations within pancreatic progenitors (PPs), endocrine progenitors (EPs), and mature islet stages derived from iPSCs. scRNA-seq further confirmed RFX3 expression across different endocrine cell clusters during differentiation. RFX3 loss disrupted pancreatic endocrine gene regulation, reduced hormone-secreting islet cells, and impaired beta-cell function and insulin secretion. Despite a significant reduction in pancreatic islet hormones, the pan-endocrine marker CHGA remained unchanged at both EP and islet stages, likely due to an increase in enterochromaffin cells (ECs). This was supported by our findings of high EC marker expression in RFX3 KO EPs and islets. In addition, RFX3 loss led to smaller islet organoids, elevated TXNIP levels, and increased apoptosis in EPs and islets. These findings underscore the crucial role of RFX3 in regulating human islet cell differentiation and its role in suppressing enterochromaffin cell specification. These insights into RFX3 function have implications for understanding islet biology and potential diabetes susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Here we investigate how Mylpf (Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylatable Fast) abundance impacts myofibril assembly in fast-twitch muscle. The two zebrafish Mylpf genes (mylpfa and mylpfb) are exclusively expressed in fast-twitch muscle. We show that these cells initially produce six times more mylpfa mRNA and protein than mylpfb. The combined Mylpf protein dosage is necessary for and proportionate to fast-twitch myofibril growth in the embryo. Fast-twitch myofibrils are severely reduced in the mylpfa-/- mutant, leading to loss of high-speed movement; however, by persistent slow movement this mutant swims as far through time as its wild-type sibling. Although the mylpfb-/- mutant has normal myofibrils, myofibril formation fails entirely in the mylpfa-/-;mylpfb-/- double mutant, indicating that the two genes are collectively essential to myofibril formation. Fast-twitch myofibril width is restored in the mylpfa-/-mutant by transgenic expression of mylpfa-GFP, mylpfb-GFP, and by human MYLPF-GFP to a degree corresponding linearly with GFP brightness. This correlate is inverted by expression of MYLPF alleles that cause Distal Arthrogryposis, which reduce myofibril size in proportion to protein abundance. These effects indicate that Mylpf dosage controls myofibril growth, impacting embryonic development and lifelong health.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

One large gene family that has experienced rapid evolution is the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC), whose proteins serve critical roles in innate and adaptive immunity. Across the [~]60 million year history of the primates, some MHC genes have turned over completely, some have changed function, some have converged in function, and others have remained essentially unchanged. Past work has typically focused on identifying MHC alleles within particular species or comparing gene content, but more work is needed to understand the overall evolution of the gene family across species. Thus, despite the immunologic importance of the MHC and its peculiar evolutionary history, we lack a complete picture of MHC evolution in the primates. We readdress this question using sequences from dozens of MHC genes and pseudogenes spanning the entire primate order, building a comprehensive set of gene and allele trees with modern methods. Overall, we find that the Class I gene subfamily is evolving much more quickly than the Class II gene subfamily, with the exception of the Class II MHC-DRB genes. We also pay special attention to the often-ignored pseudogenes, which we use to reconstruct different events in the evolution of the Class I region. We find that despite the shared function of the MHC across species, different species employ different genes, haplotypes, and patterns of variation to achieve a successful immune response. Our trees and extensive literature review represent the most comprehensive look into MHC evolution to date.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Building upon previous findings, we employ super-resolution microscopy to dissect Su(H)s influence on sog Distal (sogD) enhancer activity specifically in nuclei with preserved sogD-driven expression in the absence of Su(H) binding. We demonstrate that Su(H) occupancy perturbations alter expression levels and bursting dynamics.

While significant advances in understanding the ecological and evolutionary implications of plasticity have been made, understanding its genetic basis has lagged. However, a decade of genetic screens in the model nematode Pristionchus pacificus has culminated in 30 genes which affect mouth-form plasticity. We also recently reported the critical window of environmental sensitivity, and therefore have clear expectations for when differential gene expression should matter. Here, we collated previous data into a gene-regulatory network (GRN), and performed developmental transcriptomics across different environmental conditions, genetic backgrounds, and mouth-form mutants to assess the regulatory logic of plasticity. We found that only two genes in the GRN (eud-1 and seud-1/sult-1) are sensitive to the environment during the critical window. Interestingly, the time points of their sensitivity differ, suggesting that they act as sequential checkpoints. We also observed temporal constraint upon the transcriptional effects of mutating the GRN and revealed unexpected feedback between mouth-form genes. Surprisingly, expression of seud-1/sult-1, but not eud-1, correlated with mouth form biases across different strains and species. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of all samples identified metabolism as a shared pathway for regulating mouth-form plasticity. These data are presented in a Shiny app to facilitate gene-expression comparisons across development in up to 14 different conditions. Collectively, our results suggest that mouth-form plasticity evolved a constrained, two-tiered logic to integrate environmental information leading up to the final developmental decision.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Recent studies have demonstrated the generation of brain pericytes using a neural crest-based differentiation protocol. However, the inflammatory response of these iPSC-derived brain pericytes has not been investigated. We aimed to investigate the response of iPSC-derived brain pericytes to common inflammatory stimuli, thereby assessing the suitability of these cells to study inflammatory disease.

MethodsBrain pericytes were differentiated from iPSCs for 42 days. The expression of brain pericyte markers was assessed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescent staining at days 0, 15, 21, and 42 of differentiation to validate the brain pericyte-like phenotype. Nuclear localisation of NF{kappa}B and STAT1 was assessed by immunofluorescence following IL-1{beta}- and TNF-treatment in day 21 and day 42 iPSC-derived pericytes, and primary human pericytes. Cytometric bead array assessed the concentration of secreted inflammatory factors in the cell medium and phagocytosis was investigated using fluorescent carboxylated beads and flow cytometry.

ResultsAt day 42 of differentiation, but not at day 21, cells expressed brain pericyte markers. Generally, iPSC-derived pericytes lacked consistent responses to inflammatory treatment compared to primary human pericytes. Day 21 and 42 iPSC-derived pericytes exhibited a NF{kappa}B response to IL-1{beta} treatment comparable to primary human pericytes. Day 21 iPSC-derived pericytes exhibited a STAT1 response with IL-1{beta} treatment which was absent in day 42 cells, but present in a subset of primary human pericytes. TNF treatment presented similar NF{kappa}B responses between day 21 and 42 iPSC-derived and primary human pericytes, but a STAT1 response was again present in a subset of primary human pericytes which was absent in both day 21 and day 42 iPSC-derived pericytes. Numerous differences were observed in the secretion of cytokines and chemokines following treatment of iPSC-derived and primary human pericytes with IL-1{beta} and TNF. iPSC-derived pericytes exhibited greater rates of phagocytosis than primary human pericytes.

ConclusionsWith the increase in iPSC-derived cells in research, labs should undertake validation of lineage specificity when adapting an iPSC-derived differentiation protocol. In our hands, the inflammatory response of iPSC-derived pericytes was different to that of primary human pericytes, raising concern regarding the use of iPSC-derived pericytes to study neuroinflammatory disease.

The work presented here shows the generation of phenotypically distinct pericytes from the original protocol, demonstrating the significant variability present within some iPSC differentiation protocols. Furthermore, functional differences are demonstrated between iPSC-derived brain pericytes and primary brain pericytes, revealing limitations in the use of iPSC-derived brain pericytes to model brain pericyte biology.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this topic?C_ST_ABSBrain pericyte-like cells can be generated from induced pluripotent stem cells, however their responses to inflammatory stimuli has not been assessed.

What does this study add?iPSC-derived brain pericytes exhibit different inflammatory responses compared to primary brain pericytes, showing that some iPSC-derived cell models are not appropriate for modelling all aspects of a cells biology.

Furthermore, the iPSC-derived pericytes generated here were markedly different to those generated from the original article. It is therefore important for each lab to optimise the generation of iPSC-derived cell in their own hands to account for potential inter-lab variability.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

MAPK signaling plays a major role in regulating the self-renewal of hESC, and previous studies in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) suggested that expression of TERT, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of telomerase, relies on MAPK signaling. We examined whether MEK-ERK signaling regulated TERT transcription in a model of normal hESC. Kinase inhibitors of MEK1 and MEK2 (MEKi) or ERK1 and ERK2 (ERKi) significantly repressed TERT mRNA levels. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we observed that MEKi induced the accumulation of the repressive histone mark histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the TERT proximal promoter. This increase corresponded with a loss of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) which is associated with transcriptionally active loci. Inhibition of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which deposits H3K27me3, partially rescued the loss of TERT expression, indicating that MEK1/2 activity can limit PRC2 activity at TERT. Inhibition of MEK/ERK kinases also repressed expression of c-Myc, a transcription factor reported to regulate TERT in other immortalized cells. Consistent with a key role for c-Myc in regulating TERT, low doses of a c-Myc:MAX dimerization inhibitor induced a striking and rapid gain of H3K27me3 at TERT and repressed TERT transcription in hESC. Inhibiting c-Myc:MAX dimerization also resulted in lower MAX recruitment to TERT, suggesting that this complex acts in cis at TERT. Our study using a model of normal human pluripotent stem cells identifies new regulators and mechanisms controlling transcription of an important, developmentally regulated gene involved in telomere protection.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

In addition to being associated with the autism and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, mutations in the L1CAM family of genes also underlie distinct developmental syndromes with neurological conditions, such as intellectual disability, spastic paraplegia, hypotonia and congenital hydrocephalus. Studies in both vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms have established conserved neurodevelopmental roles for L1CAMs; these include axon guidance, dendrite morphogenesis, synaptogenesis, and maintenance of neural architecture, among others. In Caenorhabditis elegans, L1CAMs, encoded by the sax-7 gene, are required for coordinated locomotion. We previously uncovered a genetic interaction between sax-7 and components of synaptic vesicle cycle, revealing a non-developmental role for sax-7 in regulating synaptic activity. More recently, we determined that sax-7 also genetically interacts with extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) signaling in controlling coordinated locomotion. C. elegans ERK, encoded by the mpk-1 gene, is a serine/threonine protein kinase belonging to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family that governs multiple aspects of animal development and cellular homeostasis. Here, we show this genetic interaction between sax-7 and mpk-1 occurs not only in cholinergic neurons for coordinated locomotion, but also extends outside the nervous system, revealing novel roles for SAX-7/L1CAM in non-neuronal processes, including vulval development. Our genetic findings in both the nervous system and developing vulva are consistent with SAX-7/L1CAM acting as an antagonistic modulator of ERK signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Our understanding of H3K9me3-heterochromatin stability is presently limited to individual domains and DNA repeats. We engineered Suv39h2 KO mouse embryonic stem cells to degrade remaining two H3K9me3- KMTs within one hour and found that both passive dilution and active removal contribute to H3K9me3 decay within 12-24 hours. We discovered four different H3K9me3 decay rates across the genome and chromatin features and transcription factor binding patterns that predict the stability classes. A ""binary switch"" governs heterochromatin compaction, with HP1 rapidly dissociating from heterochromatin upon KMTs depletion and a particular threshold level of HP1 limiting pioneer factor binding, chromatin opening, and exit from pluripotency within 12 hr. Unexpectedly, receding H3K9me3 domains unearth residual HP1{beta} peaks enriched with heterochromatin-inducing proteins. Our findings reveal distinct H3K9me3-heterochromatin maintenance dynamics governing gene networks and repeats that together safeguard pluripotency.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Fetal Leydig cells produce androgens, that induce the differentiation of male reproductive system and sexual characteristics. Deficiencies in Leydig cell differentiation leads to various disorders of sex development and male reproductive defects such as ambiguous genitalia, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and infertility. Fetal Leydig cells are thought to originate from proliferating progenitor cells in the testis interstitium, marked by genes like Arx, Pdgfra, Tcf21 and Wnt5a. However, the precise mechanisms governing the transition from interstitial cells to fetal Leydig cells remain elusive. Through integrated approaches involving mouse models and single-nucleus multiomic analyses, we discovered that fetal Leydig cells originate from a Nr2f2-positive non-steroidogenic interstitial cell population. Embryonic deletion of Nr2f2 in mouse testes resulted in disorders of sex development, including dysgenic testes, Leydig cell hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, and hypospadias. We found that NR2F2 promotes the progenitor cell fate while suppresses Leydig cell differentiation by directly and indirectly controlling a cohort of transcription factors and downstream genes. Bioinformatic analyses of single-nucleus ATAC-seq and NR2F2 ChIP-seq data revealed putative transcription factors co-regulating the process of interstitial to Leydig cell differentiation. Collectively, our findings not only highlight the critical role of Nr2f2 in orchestrating the transition from interstitial cells to fetal Leydig cells, but also provide molecular insight into the disorders of sex development as a result of Nr2f2 mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

This information is spatio-temporally implemented to make tissue shape and order robust and reproducible during development. What are the principles for organising this information? The mouse auditory epithelium, the organ of Corti (OC) is an excellent system to investigate this. A central domain senses sound information through mechanosensory hair cells (HC), part of a mosaic with supporting cells (SC). This is flanked by non-sensory domains. These domains undergo cellular rearrangements as they become ordered and elongate. How cellular properties are coordinated across domains and how these contribute to tissue shape is unknown. Here, we find adhesion codes, established through morphogen patterning, define OC domains as compartments. Cells in each compartment exhibit distinct patterns of ordering. By perturbing cellular rearrangements in individual compartments, we find that compartment-specific ordering can contribute to overall tissue architecture. Perturbation of cell order within a compartment also affects the organisation in another. Using vinculin mutants, we show that inter-compartment coupling is, in part, mechanical. Our work suggests that compartments and their coupling can organise morphogenetic information in space and time during organogenesis.

The budding yeast S. cerevisiae has been successfully used as a model to gain insights into eukaryotic cell size control. Multiple regulators of cell size in steady-state conditions have been identified, such as the G1/S transition activators Cln3 and Bck2 and the inhibitor Whi5. Individual deletions of these regulators result in populations with altered mean cell volumes. However, size homeostasis remains largely intact. Here, we show that although the roles of Bck2 and Cln3 for cell size regulation appear largely redundant in steady-state, a switch from fermentable to non-fermentable growth media reveals a unique role for Bck2 in cell size adaptation to changing nutrients. We use live-cell microscopy and machine learning-assisted image analysis to track single cells and their progeny through the nutrient switch. We find that after the switch, bck2del cells experience longer cell cycle arrests and more arrest associated enlargement than wild-type, whi5del or cln3del cells, indicating that Bck2 becomes the critical G1/S activator in changing nutrients. Our work demonstrates that studying size regulation during nutrient shifts to mimic the dynamic environments of free-growing microorganisms can resolve apparent redundancies observed in steady-state size regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Nevertheless, no direct link between hippocampal ripples and MSL has yet been established. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography from the hippocampus in 20 epilepsy patients during a MSL task in which participants showed steady improvement across nine 30-second training blocks interspersed with 30-second rest (offline) periods. We first demonstrate that ripple rates strongly increase during rest periods relative to training blocks. Importantly, ripple rates during rest periods tracked learning behaviour, both across blocks and across participants.

Our findings reveal minor East Asian ancestry in the Carpathian Basin (CB) Sarmatians, distinguishing them from other regional populations. Using F4-statistics, qpAdm, and IBD analysis, we show that CB Sarmatians descended from Steppe Sarmatians originating in the Ural and Kazakhstan regions, with Romanian Sarmatians serving as a genetic bridge between the two groups. We also identify two previously unknown migration waves during the Sarmatian era and a notable continuity of the Sarmatian population into the Hunnic period, despite a smaller influx of Asian-origin individuals. These results shed new light on Sarmatian migrations and the genetic history of a key population neighbouring the Roman Empire.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that ~40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code.

Here we combine in utero labeling with in vivo two-photon targeted patch-clamp recordings in mature cortex to reveal that a layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neuron's local inhibitory input reflects the embryonic progenitor type from which the neuron is born. In contrast to neighboring neurons, pyramidal neurons derived from intermediate progenitors receive synaptic inhibition that is weakly coupled to local network activity. The underlying mechanisms do not depend upon the amount of inhibitory input received from different interneuron subclasses. Rather, progenitor type defines how much inhibitory input a neuron shares with its neighbors, which is reflected in how individual interneurons target pyramidal neurons according to progenitor type. These findings reveal new significance for progenitor diversity and identify ontogenetic origins of fine-scale inhibitory cortical subnetworks.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Accurately quantifying the complete behavioral repertoire can uncover the underlying rules that guide such goal-directed behavior. However, these movements are usually complex, high-dimensional, and lead to various outcomes, posing a challenge to fully capture the complete repertoire. By tracking freely hunting zebrafish larvae using a highspeed camera and analyzing their movements, we developed a mathematical model that accurately reproduces the complete repertoire. Using the model, we show that fish position and change in heading angle following a movement are coupled, such that the choice of one of them limits the possibilities of the other. This repertoire structure uncovered fundamental principles of movements, showing that fish rotate around an identified rotation point and then move forward or backward along straight lines. From the uncovered movement principles, we identified a new guiding rule for prey interaction: in each movement, fish turn to face the prey and then move forward or backward. This enables decoupling between orientation and distance selections of the fish during the hunt. These results provide a comprehensive and continuous description of the repertoire of movements, reveal underlying algorithmic rules that govern the behavior, and offer insights into the potential neural implementation of the repertoire.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Potassium channels combine high efficiency (K+ ions permeation rates ~100 pS) and exquisite K+/Na+ selectivity by a conserved selectivity filter (SF) with four adjacent potassium-binding sites. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations can, in principle, provide a detailed, atomistic mechanism of this sophisticated ion permeation. However, currently there are clear inconsistencies between computational and experimental predictions. Firstly, the ion occupancy of the SF in simulations is lower than expected (~2.5 in MD compared to ~4 in X-ray crystallography). Secondly, in many reported MD simulations of K+ channels, K+ conductance is typically an order of magnitude lower than experimental values from single-channel electrophysiology. This discrepancy is in part because the force fields used in MD simulations of potassium channels do not account for explicit electronic polarization. One of the proposed solutions is the Electronic Continuum Correction (ECC), a force field modification that scales down formal atomic charges, to introduce the polarization in a mean-field way. In this work, we apply the ECC to MD simulations of K+ channels under applied voltage. When the ECC is used in conjunction with the Charmm36m force field, the simulated K+ conductance increases 13-fold, whereas applying the ECC to Amber14 seemingly has no major effect. Following the analysis of ion occupancy states using Hamiltonian Replica Exchange (HRE) simulations, we propose a new parameter set for Amber14sb, that leads to a similar increase in conductance. These two force fields are then used to compute, for the first time, the full current-voltage (I-V) curves from MD simulations, approaching quantitative agreement with experiments at all voltages tested, for three K+ channels. In all simulated systems, the direct knock-on permeation mechanism with near-full K+ ion occupancy of the SF is consistently observed. In general, our ECC-enabled simulations are in excellent agreement with experimental data, in terms of ion occupancy, conductance, current-voltage response, and K+/Na+ selectivity. These simulations thus form a robust basis to study structure-function relations in K+ channels on the atomistic level with unprecedented accuracy, as exemplified by deciphering the rectification mechanism of the MthK channel.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

The research includes monitoring participants prenatal routine, collecting, storing, and processing colostrum, as well as automated RNA extraction and viral RNA quantification via qRT-PCR. Thirteen participants were recruited, 13 samples of colostrum were subsequently collected, meeting eligibility criteria and signing informed consent. These samples were processed and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Six of nine samples analyzed were undetectable, and three were below the detection limit. We observed that patients with undetectable colostrum had been on ART before conception, while those with colostrum samples detectable had a detectable serum viral load at some point during pregnancy. The immunological, biochemical, and socioeconomic impact of non-breastfeeding on maternal-child health is significant, and analyzing the transmissibility potential of colostrum raises questions about possible breastfeeding with reduced risks of HIV transmission.

To address this, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens on two breast cancer cell lines with distinct dormancy properties: 4T1 (short-term dormancy) and 4T07 (prolonged dormancy). We discovered that loss of class-III PI3K, Pik3c3, revealed a unique vulnerability in 4T07 cells. Surprisingly, dormancy-prone 4T07 cells exhibited higher mTORC1 activity than 4T1 cells, due to lysosome-dependent signaling occurring at the cell periphery. Pharmacological inhibition of Pik3c3 counteracted this phenotype in 4T07 cells, and selectively reduced metastasis burden only in the 4T07 dormancy-prone model. This mechanism was also detected in human breast cancer cell lines in addition to a breast cancer patient-derived xenograft supporting that it may be relevant in humans. Our findings suggest dormant cancer cell-initiated metastasis may be prevented in patients carrying tumor cells that display PIK3C3-peripheral lysosomal signaling to mTORC1.

Statement of SignificanceWe reveal that dormancy-prone breast cancer cells depend on the class III PI3K to mediate a constant peripheral lysosomal positioning and mTORC1 hyperactivity. Targeting this pathway might blunt breast cancer metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Here, we characterise and spatially map in three dimensions the dynamics of cell mechanical properties during Drosophila gastrulation utilising line-scan Brillouin microscopy. We find that cells in the embryo undergo rapid and spatially varying changes in their mechanical properties and that these differ in cell populations with different fates and behaviours. We identify microtubules as potential effectors of cell mechanics in this system, and corroborate our experimental findings with a physical model that underscores the role of localised and dynamic changes in mechanical properties to facilitate tissue folding. Our work provides the first spatio-temporal description of the evolving mechanical properties of cell populations during morphogenesis, and highlights the potential of Brillouin microscopy in studying the dynamic changes in cell shape behaviours and cell mechanical properties simultaneously in different cell populations in an intact organism.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Intersectional vulnerabilities among individuals with SCD in the United States (US) raise historically and socially contingent questions about tubal sterilization in individuals with SCD. However immediate postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) rates among individuals with SCD in the US are unknown.

ObjectiveTo compare rates of TS in deliveries to people with SCD and without SCD, and to determine the modifying effect of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) on the odds of TS.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis repeated cross-sectional study used the 2012-2019 National Inpatient Sample to estimate the rate of TS among delivery hospitalizations to people with SCD, without SCD (non-SCD), Black people with and without SCD, and people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of TS between SCD and non-SCD deliveries, SCD and non-SCD deliveries with Black race, and SCD and CF deliveries. We examined whether SMM modified the association between TS and SCD in interaction analyses.

ExposureSCD, CF

ResultsAmong 29,822,518 deliveries, 6.7% underwent TS. Among 18,860 SCD deliveries, 8.8% underwent TS. Among 2,945 CF deliveries, 6.6% underwent TS. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, SCD had higher odds of TS compared to non-SCD deliveries (aOR= 1.38 [1.06,1.79]) and in a stratified analysis of deliveries coded with Black race (aOR= 1.42 [1.06,1.90]). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, there was no difference in the odds of TS between SCD or CF deliveries (aOR=1.0 [0.51,2.24]). SMM more than doubled the odds of TS in SCD deliveries (interaction: aOR=2.34 [1.57,3.47]; aOR= 2.14 [1.40,3.24] in deliveries coded with Black race).

ConclusionEven after accounting for patient and hospital characteristics, people with SCD have higher odds of immediate postpartum TS compared to control groups. SMM at delivery increased the odds of TS in SCD compared to all non-SCD deliveries and compared to CF deliveries. Possibly SMM severity, patient preference, or clinician recommendations inform this finding. SMM is 3-7 times more common in SCD than non-SCD pregnancies and may be a modifiable risk factor for TS in SCD deliveries.

KEY POINTS

QuestionWhat are the national rates and associations of postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) among deliveries to people with sickle cell disease (SCD) compared to deliveries to people without SCD (non-SCD) and cystic fibrosis (CF)?

FindingsFrom 2012-2019, the TS rate was significantly higher in SCD deliveries (88 per 1,000 deliveries) vs non-SCD (67 per 1,000 deliveries) and CF deliveries (66 per 1,000 deliveries). SCD was positively associated with TS. SMM modified the association between TS and SCD by two-fold.

MeaningPostpartum TS rate in people with SCD is high; SMM during SCD deliveries significantly increases the odds of postpartum TS.","NA","medrxiv",1728511743551

We report a case of a novel, idiosyncratic gesture in a Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) at  La Foret des Singes, Rocamadour, France. One adult male, Jomanix, was observed hand-clapping. To our knowledge, hand-clapping has never been described before in this species. To hand-clap, the male briefly shifted his weight onto his legs, lifted his upper body, and clapped both hands together. We recorded 30 instances of hand-clapping. Twenty-five of these hand-claps occurred in combination with other agonistic signals, such as lunges and open mouth threats. Recipients either responded with counter-aggression (N = 9) or a submissive response (N = 16). In five of the 30 events, the context was unclear. These observations suggest that the gesture constitutes an agonistic signal. According to the staff at  La Foret des Singes, the hand-clapping may have been copied from staff members who occasionally hand-clap to shoo the animals away from areas where they were not supposed to be, but that notion remains speculative. In the meantime, another subject from the same group reportedly started to hand-clap, but the subject had passed away before we could document the behaviour. The observations show that Jomanix can flexibly combine a novel gesture with other established communicative signals. The hand-clap is goal-directed and fulfils the criteria for first-order intentional communication. This case, as well as anecdotal reports from a Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana) hand-clapping to get attention, reveals greater flexibility in the gestural communication of this genus than previously assumed but also underscores that social learning of the production of communicative gestures occurs rarely in this taxon.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1728511743551

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

While several software tools are available for this task, ranging from Python and R libraries to standalone graphical user interfaces, there is lack of a tool that offers fast, automated usage and the production of publication-ready vector images.

Here we present LoVis4u, a command-line tool and Python API designed for highly customizable and fast visualisation of multiple genomic loci. LoVis4u generates vector images in PDF format based on annotation data from GenBank or GFF files. It is capable of visualising entire genomes of bacteriophages as well as plasmids and user-defined regions of longer prokaryotic genomes. Additionally, LoVis4u offers optional data processing steps to identify and highlight accessory and core genes in input sequences.

Availability and ImplementationLoVis4u is implemented in Python3 and runs on Linux and MacOS. The command-line interface covers most practical use cases, while the provided Python API allows usage within a Python program, integration into external tools, and additional customisation.

Light scattering is minimized by adding spherical polymers with low osmolarity to the extracellular medium. A clearing medium containing bovine serum albumin (SeeDB-Live) is minimally invasive to live cells, allowing for structural and functional imaging of live tissues, such as spheroids, organoids, acute brain slices, and the mouse brain in vivo. SeeDB-Live minimally affects the electrophysiological properties and sensory responses of neurons. We demonstrate its utility for widefield imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics, such as backpropagating action potentials, in acute brain slices. We also utilize SeeDB-Live for widefield voltage imaging of dozens of dendrites in vivo, demonstrating population dynamics. Thus, SeeDB-Live expands the scale and modalities of fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743551

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743552

For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution.

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743552

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1728511743552
