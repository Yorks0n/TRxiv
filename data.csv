South Africa is unique in the region because its HIV programme is largely domestically funded, although donor funds and partnerships support key components. We estimated the epidemiological impact of ceased PEPFAR support for specific services and the costs and cost-effectiveness of the South African government (SAG) potentially taking over these services.

MethodsWe used a costed version of Thembisa, a South African HIV transmission model, to simulate four scenarios: a minimum scenario assuming intervention coverage reducing proportional to PEPFARs funding share of specific activities in 2023; a maximum scenario assuming additional health system impacts; and sub-scenarios either with 3-year recovery (2029-2031) or no recovery to previous coverage. HIV programme costs were estimated from the provider perspective (SAG) in 2024/25 US dollars.

ResultsOver 2025-2028, discontinuing PEPFAR funding in South Africa without replacement by SAG would result in 150,000-296,000 additional new HIV infections (29-56% increase) and 56,000-65,000 additional AIDS-related deaths (33-38%). Permanent discontinuation of currently PEPFAR-supported services over the next 20 years increases this to 1.1-2.1 million additional new HIV infections and 519,000-712,000 additional AIDS deaths. To sustain services, SAG needs to spend an additional $710 million to $1.5 billion between 2025 and 2028. Under a reduced budget, the most cost-effective interventions to preserve are ART and PrEP.

ConclusionUnmanaged PEPFAR exit from South Africa threatens to undo a decade of progress towards ending AIDS as a public health threat unless services are taken over by other funders, including SAG.","10.1097/QAD.0000000000004272","medrxiv",1751407748193

A vaccine administered to pregnant women, protecting against 70% of K. pneumoniae infections, could avert ~400,000 cases and ~80,000 deaths annually, mostly in Africa and South Asia. Vaccine formulations targeting the capsular polysaccharide (K) or lipopolysaccharide (O) antigens are in development. Global K. pneumoniae populations display extensive K and O diversity, necessitating a polyvalent vaccine targeted to the serotypes associated with neonatal disease in relevant geographical regions. We investigated the prevalence of K and O types associated with neonatal sepsis in Africa and South Asia to inform maternal vaccine design. Methods and Findings: We analysed n=1930 K. pneumoniae neonate blood isolates from 13 surveillance studies across 35 sites in 13 countries. We used pathogen sequencing to predict K and O serotypes and correct for local transmission clusters, and Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis to estimate K and O prevalence. Eighty-seven K loci were identified. KL2, KL102, KL25, KL15 and KL62 accounted for 49% of isolates. We estimate that 20 K loci, combining the eight most prevalent per region, could cover 72.9% of all infections [95% credible interval, 69.4&--76.5%] and [&ge;]70% in each of Eastern, Western and Southern Africa and South Asia. Preliminary findings from three sites suggested sufficient temporal stability of K loci to maintain 20-valent K vaccine coverage over 5-10 years, but more longitudinal data are needed to support this prediction. O types were far less diverse (n=14 types). We estimate the top-5 (O1{beta},2, O1{beta},2{beta}, O2, O2{beta} and O4) would cover 86% [82.6--89.9%] of total infections (76--92% per region), while the top-10 would cover 99% of infections in all four regions. Conclusions: Neonatal sepsis is associated with diverse K and O types, with substantial geographic and temporal variation even after adjusting for localised transmission clusters. Despite this, a single 20-valent K vaccine could theoretically cover [&ge;]70% of infections in all target regions. Locally-targeted vaccines could achieve higher coverage with lower valency, but are less feasible. In principle, very high coverage could be achieved with lower valency O-based vaccines, however protective efficacy of antibodies targeting the O antigen remains uncertain. Further research is needed on cross-reactivity, antigen exposure and stability of antigens over time, to better inform vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

Here, we present TIME_ACT, an unsupervised 66-gene transcriptomic signature of tumor immune activation derived from TCGA melanoma data. First, TIME_ACT scores accurately identify tumors with activated immune microenvironments across cancer types. Analysis of spatial features of the tumor microenvironment revealed that TIME_ACT-high regions exhibit dense lymphocyte infiltration near tumor cells, indicating localized immune activation. Second, in 15 anti-PD1 transcriptomic cohorts spanning six cancer types, TIME_ACT outperforms 22 established signatures and methods, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76 and a clinically meaningful mean odds ratio of 6.11. Thirdly, TIME_ACT scores can be accurately inferred from tumor histopathology slides. Finally, slide-inferred TIME_ACT scores predict ICB response across eight unseen cohorts, achieving a mean AUC of 0.72 and a mean odds ratio of 5.02.

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

In early 2024, H5N1 HPAIV was detected in dairy cattle in the United States of America, where it has continued to circulate, with sporadic detections also reported in other ruminant species. The detection of high viral loads in milk from infected cattle, has resulted in several human infections, underscoring the zoonotic potential of these viruses. In response, several countries have intensified surveillance in non-avian species to evaluate the potential for undetected viral circulation in captive mammals. In Great Britain, bulk milk tank testing of cattle and targeted surveillance of captive mammalian species on an infected premises is undertaken in accordance with the outcome of a rapid risk assessment undertaken to determine the epidemiological links between the poultry and captive mammals. A result of this testing was the first recorded detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 HPAIV in a sheep in March 2025, identified on an infected poultry premises in Great Britain. An initial seropositive result in a single ewe triggered further investigation, confirming serological positivity across repeated sampling and the presence of viral RNA in milk samples. This detection was confined to a single animal and was likely attributable to proximity to infected poultry and a presumed heavily contaminated environment. The implications of this ruminant detection are discussed in the context of interspecies transmission and surveillance strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1751407748193

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, global vectors of dengue, require protein from host blood to support egg development and undergo repeated cycles of blood-feeding and egg-laying. After biting, females temporarily alter their behavioral state and suppress host-seeking while using blood-derived nutrients to develop eggs. Host-seeking suppression ends once eggs are laid. While this period has generally been thought of as one of behavioral inactivity, we reveal that it instead reflects behavioral reprogramming, during which females transition from post-blood-meal inactivity into active searching for egglaying sites. Females with mature eggs show a distinct behavioral state characterized by increased locomotor activity and a shift in circadian behavioral timing, leading to nocturnal humidity-seeking and egg-laying in an otherwise diurnal species. We show that the circadian clock gene cycle is critical for regulating this transition; its absence disrupts the timing of oviposition behaviors, leading to poor site selection and reduced predicted offspring survival. These findings suggest that during egg development, circadian clock-dependent behavioral reprogramming triggers nocturnal hyperactivity and oviposition site search, an essential process for mosquito reproduction and population viability.","NA","biorxiv",1751407748193

We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization.

Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.

Methods: SEEG data from 86 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy implanted at the UK National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery were analysed (6,372 electrode contacts). Normative structural and functional connectomes were combined with meta-analytic functional maps to estimate the probability of each contact engaging networks associated with psychiatric symptoms. A linear model, developed using published data from 80 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) treated with DBS, was used to validate the approach. Results: Networks involved in reward processing emerged as the most promising DBS targets, with a predicted required sample size of 7 patients (range 4-33). Bipolar disorder was the next most feasible (22 patients; range 10-44), followed by depression (32; range 16-49) and anxiety (38; range 17-59).

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Yet, despite growing clinical use, little is known about how sex assigned at birth shapes symptom-specific responses to these interventions, a critical gap in the move toward personalized psychiatry.

MethodsWe conducted a pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in which adults with TRD received intranasal esketamine or placebo twice weekly for four weeks, alongside a newly initiated oral antidepressant. We evaluated the effects of sex assigned at birth on overall depression severity, measured via total Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores, and across four symptom factors: sadness, negative thoughts, detachment, and neurovegetative symptoms. Rates of clinical response and remission were also analyzed by sex assigned at birth.

FindingsOverall, esketamine treatment improved total MADRS scores in both sexes; however, significant sex-specific patterns emerged. Females showed greater improvement in total MADRS scores than males towards the end of the trials, in both the placebo and esketamine arms. Females also showed more pronounced reductions in the sadness and detachment factors at the end of the trials, as well as in the neurovegetative factor on day 15, regardless of the treatment group. On the other hand, males showed a significant reduction in sadness symptoms after esketamine on day 2 of the treatment. Females had higher odds of responding, regardless of treatment arm, during later time points.

InterpretationThese findings reveal that sex assigned at birth influences overall antidepressant response and shapes the trajectory and symptom profile of improvement. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of incorporating sex assigned at birth as a key variable, essential for optimizing TRD treatment strategies and advancing individualized mental healthcare.

While previous studies have linked de novo or dominantly inherited TUBA4A missense variants to neurodegenerative phenotypes, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, hereditary spastic ataxia, and more recently, an isolated report of congenital myopathy, the full phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of TUBA4A-related disorders remains incompletely characterised. In this multi-centre study, we identified 13 novel TUBA4A missense variants in 31 individuals from 19 unrelated families. Remarkably, affected individuals in 17 families presented with a primary axial myopathy without any identified CNS involvement or history of such disease. In the remaining two families, we observed probands with cerebellar ataxia and epilepsy accompanying proximal and axial muscle weakness, establishing the first documented association between TUBA4A variants and multisystem proteinopathy.

Our cohort exhibited diverse genotypes and associated inheritance patterns: four families demonstrated autosomal dominant transmission through heterozygous variants in TUBA4A, three probands had homozygous TUBA4A variants, where the biallelic genotype was found to be associated with the disease, and the heterozygous carriers were asymptomatic; five probands carried de novo variants, and nine probands with heterozygous TUBA4A variants were classified as ""isolated-sporadic cases"" where parental samples were unavailable. Clinical phenotypes ranged from mild to severe myopathy, predominantly affecting the axial and paraspinal muscles. We observed a range of disease onset, from congenital to late adulthood. Creatine kinase levels were also variable, ranging from normal to highly elevated. Cardiac function remained preserved across the cohort.

Muscle biopsies revealed a range of pathologies, including myofibre size variation, myofibre atrophy, nemaline bodies, core-like regions, internal nuclei, and endomysial fibrosis. Immunohistochemical staining showed evidence of proteinopathy, with autophagic features and TUBA4A accumulation in patient myofibres. Complementary in silico and in vitro investigations suggested that the identified TUBA4A substitutions cause significant protein abnormalities and may differentially impact microtubule dynamics.

Our findings establish myo-tubulinopathies as distinct clinical entities, encompassing both primary myopathies and multisystem proteinopathies with muscle involvement. This study broadens the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of TUBA4A-related disorders beyond autosomal dominant or de novo mechanisms and neurodegenerative presentations. These results underscore the importance of considering TUBA4A variants in the differential diagnosis of axial myopathies and multisystem proteinopathies, regardless of central nervous system (CNS) involvement.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748193

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751407748194
