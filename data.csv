We show that presence of replicating viruses in the acinar cells of salivary glands compromises production and secretion of histatin-5, a key host-produced antifungal peptide. The salivary levels of histatin-5 were significantly reduced in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects, concomitant with enhanced prevalence of the fungal opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans. These findings provide direct evidence associating SARS-CoV-2 infection with predisposition to oral candidiasis.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus that has not previously been associated with widespread infection in cattle. As such, cattle are an extremely under-studied domestic IAV host species. IAV receptors on host cells are sialic acids (SAs) that are bound to galactose in either an 2,3 or 2,6 linkage. Human IAVs preferentially bind SA-2,6 (human receptor), whereas avian IAVs have a preference for 2,3 (avian receptor). The avian receptor can further be divided into two receptors: IAVs isolated from chickens generally bind more tightly to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,4 (chicken receptor), whereas IAVs isolated from duck to SA-2,3-Gal-{beta}1,3 (duck receptor). We found all receptors were expressed, to a different degree, in the mammary gland, respiratory tract, and cerebrum of beef and/or dairy cattle. The duck and human IAV receptors were widely expressed in the bovine mammary gland, whereas the chicken receptor dominated the respiratory tract. In general, only a low expression of IAV receptors was observed in the neurons of the cerebrum. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the high levels of H5N1 virus reported in infected bovine milk and show cattle have the potential to act as a mixing vessel for novel IAV generation.

Over the last decade, there has been a notable shift from point-and-click pipeline solutions such as Galaxy towards command-line solutions such as Nextflow and Snakemake. We report on recent developments in the nf-core and Nextflow frameworks that have led to widespread adoption across many scientific communities. We describe how adopting nf-core standards enables faster development, improved interoperability, and collaboration with the >8,000 members of the nf-core community. The recent development of Nextflow Domain-Specific Language 2 (DSL2) allows pipeline components to be shared and combined across projects. The nf-core community has harnessed this with a library of modules and subworkflows that can be integrated into any Nextflow pipeline, enabling research communities to progressively transition to nf-core best practices. We present a case study of nf-core adoption by six European research consortia, grouped under the EuroFAANG umbrella and dedicated to farmed animal genomics. We believe that the process outlined in this report can inspire many large consortia to seek harmonisation of their data analysis procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

However, the specific role of the germline in shaping vertebrate aging remains largely unknown. Here, we use the turquoise killifish (N. furzeri) to genetically arrest germline development at discrete stages, and examine how different modes of infertility impact life-history. We first construct a comprehensive single-cell gonadal atlas, providing cell-type-specific markers for downstream phenotypic analysis. Next, we show that germline depletion - but not arresting germline differentiation - enhances damage repair in female killifish. Conversely, germline-depleted males instead showed an extension in lifespan and rejuvenated metabolic functions. Through further transcriptomic analysis, we highlight enrichment of pro-longevity pathways and genes in germline-depleted male killifish and demonstrate functional conservation of how these factors may regulate longevity in germline-depleted C. elegans. Our results therefore demonstrate that different germline manipulation paradigms can yield pronounced sexually dimorphic phenotypes, implying alternative responses to classical evolutionary tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

We find the correlation of Neandertal segment locations across individuals and their divergence to sequenced Neandertals, both support a model of single major Neandertal gene flow.

As a substrate receptor of the CULLIN3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, KBTBD4 is recurrently mutated in medulloblastoma (MB), the most common embryonal brain tumor in children, and pineoblastoma. These mutations impart gain-of-function to KBTBD4 to induce aberrant degradation of the transcriptional corepressor CoREST. However, their mechanism of action remains unresolved. Here, we elucidate the mechanistic basis by which KBTBD4 mutations promote CoREST degradation through engaging HDAC1/2, the direct neomorphic target of the substrate receptor. Using deep mutational scanning, we systematically map the mutational landscape of the KBTBD4 cancer hotspot, revealing distinct preferences by which insertions and substitutions can promote gain-of-function and the critical residues involved in the hotspot interaction. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of two distinct KBTBD4 cancer mutants bound to LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST reveals that a KBTBD4 homodimer asymmetrically engages HDAC1 with two KELCH-repeat propeller domains. The interface between HDAC1 and one of the KBTBD4 propellers is stabilized by the MB mutations, which directly insert a bulky side chain into the active site pocket of HDAC1. Our structural and mutational analyses inform how this hotspot E3-neo-substrate interface can be chemically modulated. First, our results unveil a converging shape complementarity-based mechanism between gain-of-function E3 mutations and a molecular glue degrader, UM171. Second, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2 inhibitors can block the mutant KBTBD4-HDAC1 interface, the aberrant degradation of CoREST, and the growth of KBTBD4-mutant MB models. Altogether, our work reveals the structural and mechanistic basis of cancer mutation-driven neomorphic protein-protein interactions and pharmacological strategies to modulate their action for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

This study, involving 23 healthy university students, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how VR exercise affects working memory, a key executive function, and its underlying neural mechanisms. Our findings indicate that a 10-min VR exercise session improved mood (arousal and vitality level) and working memory task performance (3-back task) more effectively than exercise or rest alone. Furthermore, the results confirmed that increased vitality from exercise and VR exercise interventions was associated with improved 3-back task performance. However, specific brain regions contributing to this enhancement remain unidentified. These results highlight VR exercise as the optimal exercise program for enhancing working memory function by increasing vitality level. These insights underscore VRs potential as a novel exercise modality with benefits extending beyond exercise adherence to potentially preventing dementia and depression.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

We evaluated 142 participants, including uninfected controls (N=35), acutely infected individuals (N=54), convalescent controls (N=25), and Long Covid patients (N=28), by comprehensive immunologic, virologic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. Long Covid was characterized by persistent inflammatory pathways compared with convalescent controls and uninfected controls, including upregulation of IL-6 and JAK-STAT pathways as well as activation of coagulation, complement, metabolism, and T cell exhaustion pathways. Moreover, robust activation of these pathways during acute COVID-19 infection correlated with the subsequent development of Long Covid. In an independent validation cohort (N=47), Long Covid patients had higher levels of plasma IL-6R compared with convalescent controls and uninfected controls. These data demonstrate that Long Covid is characterized by persistent activation of chronic inflammatory pathways, suggesting novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957012

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957012

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

Yet, making it full-text searchable and easily accessible to researchers in life and data science is an unsolved problem. In this work, we take advantage of recently developed, very efficient data structures and algorithms for representing sequence sets. We make Petabases of DNA sequences across all clades of life, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, and humans, fully searchable and make the indexes available to the research community. The indexes are a highly compressed representation of the input sequences (up to 5800 fold) and fit on a single consumer hard drive (~$100). We present the underlying methodological framework, called MetaGraph, that allows us to scalably index very large sets of DNA or protein sequences using annotated De Bruijn graphs. We demonstrate the feasibility of indexing the full extent of existing sequencing data and present new approaches for efficient and cost-effective full-text search at an on-demand cost of $0.10 per queried Mpb.

Variant effect predictors (VEPs) play a vital role in deciphering this complex relationship, yet evaluating their performance remains challenging due to data circularity, where the same or related data is used for training and assessment. High-throughput experimental strategies like deep mutational scanning (DMS) offer a promising solution. In this study, we extend upon our previous benchmarking approach, assessing the performance of 84 different VEPs and DMS experiments from 36 different human proteins. In addition, a new pairwise, VEP-centric ranking method reduces the impact of VEP score availability on the overall ranking. We observe a remarkably high correspondence between VEP performance in DMS-based benchmarks and clinical variant classification, especially for predictors that have not been directly trained on human clinical variants. Our results suggest that comparing VEP performance against diverse functional assays represents a reliable strategy for assessing their relative performance in clinical variant classification. However, major challenges in clinical interpretation of VEP scores persist, highlighting the need for further research to fully leverage computational predictors for genetic diagnosis.

Traditionally, ER moves by either sliding along stable microtubules via molecular motors or attaching to the plus ends of dynamic microtubules through tip attachment complexes (TAC). A recently discovered third process, hitchhiking, involves motile vesicles pulling ER tubules along microtubules. Previous research showed that ER hitchhikes on Rab5- and Rab7-marked endosomes, but it is uncertain if other Rab-vesicles can do the same. In U2OS cells, we screened Rabs for their ability to cotransport with ER tubules and found that ER hitchhikes on post-Golgi vesicles marked by Rab6 (isoforms a and b). Rab6-ER hitchhiking occurs independently of ER-endolysosome contacts and TAC-mediated ER movement. Disrupting either Rab6 or the motility of Rab6-vesicles reduces overall ER movement. Conversely, relocating these vesicles to the cell periphery causes peripheral ER accumulation, indicating that Rab6-vesicle motility is crucial for a subset of ER movements. Proximal post-Golgi vesicles marked by TGN46 are involved in Rab6-ER hitchhiking, while other post-Golgi vesicles (Rabs 8/10/11/13/14) are not essential for ER movement. Our further analysis finds that ER to Golgi vesicles marked by Rab1 are also capable of driving a subset of ER movements. Taken together, our findings suggest that ER hitchhiking on Rab-vesicles is a significant mode of ER movement.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time.

Here, we explored a large number of publicly available human microbiome datasets and retrieved a total of 829 anellovirus genomes, substantially expanding the known diversity of these viruses. The majority of new genomes fall within the three major human anellovirus genera: Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus and Gammatorquevirus, while we also present one new genome of the under-sampled Hetorquevirus genus. The phylogeny reconstructed from the conserved ORF1 gene reveals three additional, previously undescribed, human anellovirus clades. We performed recombination analysis and show evidence of extensive recombination across all human anelloviruses. Interestingly, more than 95% of the detected events are between members of the same clade and only 15 inter-clade recombination events were detected. The breakpoints of recombination cluster in hotspots at the ends and outside of the ORF1 gene, while a recombination coldspot was detected within the gene. Our analysis suggests that anellovirus evolution is governed by homologous recombination, however events between distant viruses or ones producing chimaeric ORF1s likely lead to non-viable recombinants. The large number of genomes further allowed us to examine how essential genomic features vary across anelloviruses. These include functional domains in the ORF1 protein and the nucleotide motif of the replication loop region, required for the viruses' rolling-circle replication. A subset of the genomes assembled in both this and previous studies are completely lacking these essential elements, opening up the possibility that anellovirus intracellular populations contain defective virus genomes (DVGs). Overall, our study highlights key features of anellovirus genomics and evolution, a largely understudied group of viruses whose potential in virus-based therapeutics is recently being explored.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

We therefore assessed and compared the feasibility of testing wastewater from inbound aircraft and airport terminals for 18 pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 in Singapore, a popular travel hub in Asia.

MethodsWastewater samples collected from inbound medium- and long-haul flights and airport terminals were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was carried out on positive samples to identify SARS-CoV-2 variants. Airport and aircraft samples were further tested for 17 other pathogens through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

ResultsThe proportion of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples and the average virus load was higher for wastewater samples from aircraft as compared to airport terminals. Cross-correlation analyses indicated that viral load trends from airport wastewater led local COVID-19 case trends by two to five days. A total of ten variants (44 sub-lineages) were successfully identified from aircraft wastewater and airport terminals, and four variants of interest (VOIs) and one variant under monitoring (VUM) were detected in aircraft and airport wastewater 18-31 days prior to detection in local clinical cases. The detection of five respiratory and four enteric viruses in aircraft wastewater samples further underscores the potential to expand aircraft wastewater to monitoring pathogens beyond SARS-CoV-2.

ConclusionOur findings demonstrate the feasibility of aircraft wastewater testing for monitoring infectious diseases threats, potentially detecting signals before clinical cases are reported. The triangulation of similar datapoints from aircraft wastewater of international travel nodes could therefore serve as a useful early warning system for global health threats.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957012

CryoEM has revolutionized structure determination of large proteins and their complexes, but a vast majority of proteins that underlie human diseases are small (<50 kDa) and usually beyond its reach due to low signal-to-noise images and difficulties in particle alignment. Current strategies to overcome this problem increase the overall size of small protein targets using scaffold proteins that bind to the target, but are limited by inherent flexibility and not being bound to their targets in a rigid manner, resulting in the target being poorly resolved compared to the scaffolds. Here we present an iteratively engineered molecular design for transforming Fabs (antibody fragments), into conformationally rigid scaffolds (Rigid-Fabs) that, when bound to small proteins (~20 kDa), can enable high-resolution structure determination using cryoEM. This design introduces multiple disulfide bonds at strategic locations, generates a well-folded Fab constrained into a rigid conformation and can be applied to Fabs from various species, isotypes and chimeric Fabs. We present examples of the Rigid Fab design enabling high-resolution (2.3-2.5 Angstroms) structures of small proteins, Ang2 (26 kDa) and KRAS (21 kDa) by cryoEM. The strategies for designing disulfide constrained Rigid Fabs in our work thus establish a general approach to overcome the target size limitation of single particle cryoEM.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957012

However, the process by which soluble cytoskeletal monomers maneuver through the cytoplasm's ever-changing environment to reach their destinations without using these pathways remains unknown. 4-6 Here, we show that actin cytoskeletal treadmilling leads to the formation of a semi-permeable actin-myosin barrier, creating a specialized compartment separated from the rest of the cell body that directs proteins toward the cell edge by advection, diffusion facilitated by fluid flow. Contraction at this barrier generates a molecularly non-specific fluid flow that transports actin, actin-binding proteins, adhesion proteins, and even inert proteins forward. The local curvature of the barrier specifically targets these proteins toward protruding edges of the leading edge, sites of new filament growth, effectively coordinating protein distribution with cellular dynamics. Outside this compartment, diffusion remains the primary mode of protein transport, contrasting sharply with the directed advection within. This discovery reveals a novel protein transport mechanism that redefines the front of the cell as a pseudo-organelle, actively orchestrating protein mobilization for cellular front activities such as protrusion and adhesion. By elucidating a new model of protein dynamics at the cellular front, this work contributes a critical piece to the puzzle of how cells adapt their internal structures for targeted and rapid response to extracellular cues. The findings challenge the current understanding of intracellular transport, suggesting that cells possess highly specialized and previously unrecognized organizational strategies for managing protein distribution efficiently, providing a new framework for understanding the cellular architecture's role in rapid response and adaptation to environmental changes.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

But the exact role of pupil size in visual perception is still poorly understood. We recorded pupil size and electrical activity from the retina and brain while healthy human participants viewed full-screen flashes. We found that early retinal responses, which peaked around 25 ms after stimulus onset and predicted subsequent activity over visual cortex, were strongly affected by stimulus intensity. Importantly, pupil size, at least within the range of naturally occurring fluctuations, did not affect the amplitude of these early retinal responses, despite resulting in substantial changes in retinal light exposure. However, the direction of pupil-size change at the moment of stimulus presentation did modulate the amplitude of early retinal responses, which were enhanced during phases of dilation as compared to constriction. Based on these results, we suggest that fast-acting adaptation processes may normalize early retinal responses with respect to changes in retinal light exposure that result from spontaneous changes in pupil size: an initial form of brightness constancy. These results shed new light on, and raise important and previously unasked questions about, the role of pupil size in visual perception.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Consistent with behavior, missing inferred stimulus features were represented at prototypical values in neocortex. This cortical completion effect correlated with hippocampal responses, which in turn reflected the distance between imagined prototypes and experienced exemplars. This was paralleled by a learning-dependent grid-like representation of the underlying concept space in entorhinal cortex.

However, contrasting previous accounts, we find no evidence for dorsal and ventral hypohyals or a postarticular process of the lower jaw. We also confirm the presence of a prearticular. The presence of a mobile upper jaw, elaborate gill rakers and reduced dentition also support a possible facultative filter feeding ecology. These new anatomical data support removal of D. bechei from Pholidophoridae and Pholidophoriformes as currently defined but indicate that finer-scale patterns of relationships among more crownward members of the teleost stem are some way from being resolved.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Aquaporin-4 assembles in astrocyte plasma membranes as symmetric tetramers or as arrays of tetramers. We report molecular structures of aquaporin-4 alone and bound to Fab fragments from patient-derived NMO autoantibodies using cryogenic electron microscopy. Each antibody binds to epitopes comprised of three extracellular loops of aquaporin-4 with contributions from multiple molecules in the assembly. The structures distinguish between antibodies that bind to the tetrameric form of aquaporin-4, and those targeting higher order orthogonal arrays of tetramers that provide more diverse bridging epitopes.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

In line with its adaptability, P. aeruginosa produces various exoproducts crucial for survival and virulence, several of which regulated through quorum sensing (QS). These factors are also regulated in response to environmental cues, such as temperature changes. As a pathogen, P. aeruginosa is generally thought to activate its virulence factors at temperatures akin to warm-blooded hosts rather than environmental temperatures. Recent studies elucidated the functional structure of the QS transcriptional regulator RhlR, which depends on the stabilizing effects of its cognate autoinducing ligand, N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), and of the moonlighting chaperone PqsE. Given the influence of temperature on biomolecular dynamics, we investigated how it affects RhlR activity using the RhlR-regulated phzA1 promoter as a proxy. Unexpectedly, we found that RhlR activity is higher at 25{degrees}C than at 37{degrees}C. This temperature-dependent regulation likely stems from altered RhlR turnover, with the presence of PqsE extending RhlR activity tenfold from its basal level at 37{degrees}C to that observed at 25{degrees}C. This lower, environmental-like temperature promotes increased affinity between RhlR and C4-HSL, a trait significantly compromised in the absence of PqsE. These results suggest that this response depends on the structural integrity of the complex, indicating that temperature functions as an additional regulating and stabilizing factor of RhlR function. Accordingly, lower growth temperature fails to increase the activity of a structurally stabilized version of RhlR. The thermoregulation aspect of RhlR activity and signalling impacts the virulence profile of a mutant unable to produce C4-HSL, underscoring its significance in bacterial behaviours and potentially conferring an evolutionary advantage.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

In the tropical montane islands of Fiji, there are 28 species of endemic bee in the subgenus Lasioglossum (Homalictus), where species richness increases with elevation despite decreasing land surface (habitat) areas. We used a combination of spatially explicit phylogenetic diversity analyses and phylogenetic trait analyses to examine the factors shaping species distributions in these bees. We found that species at higher elevations had lower heat tolerance and desiccation resistance than those at lower elevations, consistent with these traits constraining species elevational ranges. We also found high species phylogenetic diversity within mountains, and high phylogenetic signal in species heat tolerance and minimum elevational ranges, consistent with these traits being evolutionarily conserved among mountain-top taxa following vicariant (allopatric) speciation. We found no evidence to suggest that interspecific competition is shaping species elevational ranges. In all, our findings indicate that phylogenetic conservatism in physiological traits related to climatic niche, such as heat tolerance, can explain why species richness is highest at mountain tops in this system, with species having tracked their climatic niches over time towards ever higher (cooler and wetter) elevations. Because high elevations in this archipelago are extremely limited (~2.3% of total land area), only miniscule elevational (islands in the sky) remain into which this diverse, but climate-restricted fauna, can retreat as climates warm.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

To further investigate these rearrangements, we have undertaken a comparison of 12 clitellate genomes (including four newly sequenced species) and 11 outgroup representatives. We show that these rearrangements began at the base of the Clitellata (rather than progressing gradually throughout polychaete annelids), that the inter-chromosomal rearrangements continue in several clitellate lineages and that these events have substantially shaped the evolution of the otherwise highly conserved Hox cluster.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Here, single-cell ATAC-seq analysis shows that ZmWUS1 overexpression alters chromatin accessibility throughout the central zone. The CAATAATGC motif, a known homeodomain recognition site, is predominantly observed in the regions with increased chromatin accessibility suggesting ZmWUS1 is an activator in the central zone.

However 3D cell segmentation, which requires dense annotation of 2D slices still poses significant challenges. Labelling every cell in every 2D slice is prohibitive. Moreover it is ambiguous, necessitating cross-referencing with other orthoviews. Lastly, there is limited ability to unambiguously record and visualize 1000s of annotated cells.

Here we performed such rescues with a panel of receptor variants and promoters, in combination with tissue-specific transgene knockouts. Our experiments demonstrate that brassinosteroid receptor expression in several tissues is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. Moreover, complementation with tissue-specific promoters requires the genuine BRI1 gene body sequence, which confers ubiquitous expression of trace receptor amounts that are sufficient to promote brassinosteroid-dependent root growth.

Since selection acts over multiple generations, many approaches have been developed to detect and quantify selection using genetic data sampled at multiple points in time. Such time series genetic data is commonly analyzed using Hidden Markov Models, but in most cases, under the assumption of additive selection. However, many examples of genetic variation exhibiting non-additive mechanisms exist, making it critical to develop methods that can characterize selection in more general scenarios. Thus, we extend a previously introduced expectation-maximization algorithm for the inference of additive selection coefficients to the case of general diploid selection, in which heterozygote and homozygote fitnesses are parameterized independently. We furthermore introduce a framework to identify bespoke modes of diploid selection from given data, as well as a procedure for aggregating data across linked loci to increase power and robustness. Using extensive simulation studies, we find that our method accurately and efficiently estimates selection coefficients for different modes of diploid selection across a wide range of scenarios; however, power to classify the mode of selection is low unless selection is very strong. We apply our method to ancient DNA samples from Great Britain in the last 4,450 years, and detect evidence for selection in six genomic regions, including the well-characterized LCT locus. Our work is the first genome-wide scan characterizing signals of general diploid selection.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

However, most existing externally triggered delivery systems are based on complex micromachines that are controlled with electromagnetic waves and require custom external instrumentation. Here we present a drug delivery platform comprising a simple protein-containing hydrogel that can be both imaged and triggered to release drugs at specific locations using widely available ultrasound imaging devices. This technology is based on the addition of air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles (GVs) to hydrogel delivery vehicles. While intact, GVs sterically block the release of drug payloads and allow the vehicle to be imaged with ultrasound. An increase in ultrasound pressure causes the collapse of GVs within hydrogels present at the desired anatomical location, instantly creating percolation channels and triggering rapid drug release. Both the imaging and release are performed using a common diagnostic ultrasound probe. We implement this concept by establishing ultrasound-controlled drug diffusion and release from hydrogels in vitro and demonstrating targeted image-guided protein delivery in vivo following oral administration. We use this approach to deliver anti-inflammatory antibodies to treat gastrointestinal inflammation in a rat model of colitis. Targeted acoustic percolation switches (TAPS) open a conduit for local, image-guided drug delivery with a simple formulation and commonplace ultrasound equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Non-invasive in situ imaging techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (XCT scanning) could mitigate this, but the consequences of exposing carcasses to X-rays are not fully understood, and evidence regarding the impact of X-rays on internal microbial faunas that drive decay is conflicting. Here, we test whether XCT scanning impacts the decay of Danio rerio carcasses within a substrate.

Our XCT data show that exposure to X-rays does not cause a deviation from the normal sequence of decay, validating XCT as a non-destructive visualisation method for decay experiments. Furthermore, when accompanied with traditional exhumation and dissection, XCT provides decay data with higher accuracy of character analysis than traditional methods, and allows novel quantitative techniques to monitor physical changes in the decaying carcass (e.g., total volume, build-up of gases, collapse of the body cavity etc.).

We investigated how SMXL proteins control development. SMXL7 can partially replicate SMAX1 function in seeds and seedlings, but SMAX1 cannot replace SMXL7 in shoot branching control. Therefore, the distinct roles of these genes arise from differences in protein activity more than expression. Analysis of chimeras and domain deletions of SMAX1 and SMXL7 proteins revealed that an N-terminal domain is necessary and sufficient to specify developmental functions. We screened 158 transcription factors for interactions with SMAX1. The N-terminal domain is necessary and/or sufficient for the majority of candidate interactions.

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Genetic reconstruction of the ancestry of Pontic-Caspian steppe and West Asian populations points to the North Caucasus-Lower Volga area as the homeland of Indo-Anatolian languages and to the Serednii Stih archaeological culture of the Dnipro-Don area as the homeland of Indo-European languages. The Caucasus-Lower Volga people had diverse distal roots, estimated using the qpAdm software on the left barplot, as Caucasus hunter-gatherer (purple), Central Asian (red), Eastern hunter-gatherer (pink), and West Asian Neolithic (green). Caucasus-Lower Volga expansions, estimated using qpAdm on the right barplot as disseminated Caucasus Neolithic (blue)-Lower Volga Eneolithic (orange) proximal ancestries, mixing with the inhabitants of the North Pontic region (yellow), Volga region (yellow), and West Asia (green).

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds. We propose an alternative view of musical beat perception and synchronization ability as a continuum onto which a wider range of species can be mapped depending on their ability to perform and coordinate the general abilities listed above through association with reward.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Amborella trichopoda, the sole species on a lineage that is sister to all other extant flowering plants, is dioecious with a young ZW sex determination system. Here we present a haplotype-resolved genome assembly, including highly-contiguous assemblies of the Z and W chromosomes. We identify a ~3-Megabase sex-determination region (SDR) captured in two strata that includes a ~300-Kilobase inversion that is enriched with repetitive sequence and contains a homolog of the Arabidopsis METHYLTHIOADENOSINE NUCLEOSIDASE (MTN1-2) genes, which are known to be involved in fertility. However, the remainder of the SDR does not show patterns typically found in non-recombining SDRs, like repeat accumulation and gene loss. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dioecy is recently derived in Amborella and the sex chromosome pair has not significantly degenerated.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

The soft coral was identified as a xeniid octocoral (species undetermined), resembling the octocoral Unomia stolonifera, which has invaded and overgrown reefs in Venezuela in recent years. To conclusively characterize the species of the invading xeniid, we employed multilocus barcoding targeting four genes (ND2, mtMutS, COI, and 28S) of three separate colonies across three locations in southwest Puerto Rico. Sequence comparisons with xeniid sequences from GenBank, including those from the genera Xenia and Unomia, indicated a 100% sequence identity (>3,000 bp combined) with the species Xenia umbellata (Octocorallia : Malacalcyonacea : Xeniidae). Xenia umbellata is native to the Red Sea and to our knowledge, this represents the first confirmed case of this species as an invader on Caribbean reefs. Similar to U. stolonifera, X. umbellata is well known for its ability to rapidly overgrow substrate as well as tolerate environmental extremes. In addition, X. umbellata has recently been proposed as a model system for tissue regeneration having the ability to regenerate completely from a single tentacle. These characteristics greatly amplify X. umbellatas potential to adversely affect any reef it invades. Our findings necessitate continued collaborative action between local management agencies and stakeholders in Puerto Rico, as well as neighboring islands, to monitor and control this invasion prior to significant ecological perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Inspired by the eukaryotic ubiquitination cascade, we developed an ATP-driven platform for C-terminal activation and peptide ligation based on E. coli MccB, a bacterial ancestor of ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzymes that natively catalyzes C-terminal phosphoramidate bond formation. We show that MccB can act on non-native substrates to generate an O-AMPylated electrophile that can react with exogenous nucleophiles to form diverse C-terminal functional groups including thioesters, a versatile class of biological intermediates that have been exploited for protein semisynthesis. To direct this activity towards specific proteins of interest, we developed the Thioesterification C-terminal Handle (TeCH)-tag, a sequence that enables high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation via a thioester intermediate. By mining the natural diversity of the MccB family, we developed two additional MccB/TeCH-tag pairs that are mutually orthogonal to each other and to the E. coli system, facilitating the synthesis of more complex bioconjugates. Our method mimics the chemical logic of peptide bond synthesis that is widespread in biology for high-yield in vitro manipulation of protein structure with molecular precision.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Six-week-old mice lacking either Pnma1 or Pnma4 are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, but by six months the mutant mice become prematurely subfertile, with precipitous drops in sex hormone levels, gonadal atrophy, and abdominal obesity; overall they produce markedly fewer offspring than controls. Analysis of donated human ovaries shows that expression of both genes declines normally with aging, while several PNMA1 and PNMA4 variants identified in genome-wide association studies are causally associated with low testosterone, altered puberty onset, or obesity.

Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) offers a potential solution. Given a nanoscale map of two putative interaction partners, it should be possible to assign molecules either to the class of coupled pairs or to the class of non-coupled bystanders. Here, we developed a probabilistic algorithm that allows accurate determination of both the absolute number and the proportion of molecules that form coupled pairs. The algorithm calculates interaction probabilities for all possible pairs of localized molecules, selects the most likely interaction set, and corrects for any spurious colocalizations. Benchmarking this approach across a set of simulated molecular localization maps with varying densities (up to [~]50 molecules m-2) and localization precisions (5 to 50 nm) showed typical errors in the identification of correct pairs of only a few percent. At molecular densities of [~]5-10 molecules m-2 and localization precisions of 20-30 nm, which are typical parameters for SMLM imaging, the recall was [~]90%. The algorithm was effective at differentiating between non-interacting and coupled molecules both in simulations and experiments. Finally, it correctly inferred the number of coupled pairs over time in a simulated reaction-diffusion system, enabling determination of the underlying rate constants. The proposed approach promises to enable direct visualization and quantification of intermolecular interactions using SMLM.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Disruptions to this regulation can result in developmental abnormalities and malignancies, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Wilms tumors, a type of embryonal tumor closely linked to disrupted organogenesis, harbor mutations in epigenetic regulators in 30-50% of cases. However, the role of these regulators in kidney development and pathogenesis remains unexplored. By integrating mouse modeling, histological characterizations, and single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling, we show that a Wilms tumor-associated mutation in the chromatin reader protein ENL disrupts kidney development trajectory by rewiring the gene regulatory landscape. Specifically, the mutant ENL promotes the commitment of nephron progenitors while simultaneously restricting their differentiation by dysregulating key transcription factor regulons, particularly the HOX clusters. It also induces the emergence of abnormal progenitor cells that lose their chromatin identity associated with kidney specification. Furthermore, the mutant ENL might modulate stroma-nephron interactions via paracrine Wnt signaling. These multifaceted effects caused by the mutation result in severe developmental defects in the kidney and early postnatal mortality in mice. Notably, transient inhibition of the histone acetylation binding activity of mutant ENL with a small molecule displaces transcriptional condensates formed by mutant ENL from target genes, abolishes its gene activation function, and restores developmental defects in mice. This work provides new insights into how mutations in epigenetic regulators can alter the gene regulatory landscape to disrupt kidney developmental programs at single-cell resolution in vivo. It also offers a proof-of-concept for the use of epigenetics-targeted agents to rectify developmental defects.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

We investigated the effects of adopting a medical cannabis law on the cost of employer-sponsored health insurance.

MethodsWe analyzed state-level data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) Private Sector spanning from 2003 to 2022. The outcomes included log transformed average total premiums per employee for single, employee-plus-one, and family coverage plans. We utilized the Sun and Abraham (2021) difference-in-difference (DiD) method, looking at the overall DiD and event-study DiD. Models were adjusted for various state-level demographics and dichotomous policy variables including whether a state later adopted recreational cannabis as well as time and unit fixed effects and population weights.

ResultsFor states that adopted a medical cannabis law, there was a significant decrease in the log average total premium per employee for single (-0.034, standard error [SE] = 0.009) and employee plus one (-0.025, SE = 0.009) coverage plans considering the first 10 years of policy change compared to states without such laws. Looking at the last five years of policy change, we saw increases in effect size and statistical significance. Sensitivity analyses suggest findings are robust to our model specifications.

DiscussionAdoption of a medical cannabis law may contribute to decreases in healthcare costs. This phenomenon is likely a secondary effect and suggests positive externalities outside of medical cannabis patients.

Key PointsO_LIStates that passed medical cannabis laws, compared to states that did not pass such laws, saw decreases in the average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums.
C_LIO_LIThe difference in average total costs for employer-sponsored health insurance premiums, comparing states with and without medical cannabis laws, grew over time.
C_LIO_LIThis paper contributes to the idea that medical cannabis laws may contain positive externalities.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957013

ARHGAP19 is a GTPase-activating protein with activity towards RhoA. In vitro biochemical assays revealed that variants located within the GAP domain cause loss of GAP activity. iPSc-derived motor neurons exhibited 50% knockdown of ARHGAP19 protein. In vivo genetic perturbations of the Drosophila melanogaster ARHGAP19 ortholog RhoGAP54D reduced self-driven locomotor activity and startle responses to visual stimuli. Zebrafish loss-of-function models similarly exhibited movement deficits, coupled with increased motor neuron axonal branching but shorter caudal primary motor neurons. Together, these findings establish ARHGAP19 as a novel cause of early-onset neuropathy through a loss-of-function mechanism.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957013

Spatial-omics technologies can simultaneously measure information from three complementary domains related to this task: expression levels of a panel of molecular biomarkers at single-cell resolution, relative positions of cells, and images of tissue sections, but existing computational methods for performing this task on single-cell spatial-omics datasets often relinquish information from one or more domains. The additional reliance on the availability of ""atlas"" training or reference datasets limits cell type discovery to well-defined but limited cell population labels, thus posing major challenges for using these methods in practice. Successful integration of all three domains presents an opportunity for uncovering cell populations that are functionally stratified by their spatial contexts at cellular and tissue levels: the key motivation for employing spatial-omics technologies in the first place. In this work, we introduce Cell Spatio- and Neighborhood-informed Annotation and Patterning (CellSNAP), a self-supervised computational method that learns a representation vector for each cell in tissue samples measured by spatial-omics technologies at the single-cell or finer resolution. The learned representation vector fuses information about the corresponding cell across all three aforementioned domains. By applying CellSNAP to datasets spanning both spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic modalities, and across different tissue types and disease settings, we show that CellSNAP markedly enhances de novo discovery of biologically relevant cell populations at fine granularity, beyond current approaches, by fully integrating cells' molecular profiles with cellular neighborhood and tissue image information.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

In eukaryotes, loop-extruding SMC complexes form topologically associating domains (TADs) by being stalled by roadblock proteins. It remains unclear whether a similar mechanism of domain formation exists in prokaryotes. Using high-resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing, we show that an archaeal homolog of the bacterial Smc-ScpAB complex organizes the genome of Thermococcus kodakarensis into TAD-like domains. We also find that TrmBL2, a nucleoid-associated protein that forms a stiff nucleoprotein filament, stalls the T. kodakarensis SMC complex and establishes a boundary at the site-specific recombination site dif. TrmBL2 stalls the SMC complex at tens of additional non-boundary loci with lower efficiency. Intriguingly, the stalling efficiency is correlated with structural properties of underlying DNA sequences. Our study illuminates not only a eukaryotic-like mechanism of domain formation in archaea, but also an unforeseen role of intrinsic DNA structure in large-scale genome organization.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Here, we analyzed the underlying mechanism of immune imprinting alleviation in inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac) cohorts. We observed in CoronaVac-vaccinated individuals who experienced BA.5/BF.7 breakthrough infection (BTI), the proportion of Omicron-specific memory B cells (MBCs) substantially increased after an extended period post-Omicron BTI, with their antibodies displaying enhanced somatic hypermutation and neutralizing potency. Consequently, the neutralizing antibody epitope distribution encoded by MBCs post-BA.5/BF.7 BTI after prolonged maturation closely mirrors that in BA.5/BF.7-infected unvaccinated individuals.Together, these results indicate the activation and expansion of Omicron-specific naive B cells generated by first-time Omicron exposure helped to alleviate CoronaVac-induced immune imprinting, and the absence of this process should have caused the persistent immune imprinting seen in mRNA vaccine recipients.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

We found widespread changes in cerebellar calcium signals during behavioral seizures and during hippocampal seizures that remained electrographic only, arguing against cerebellar modulation simply reflecting motor components. Moreover, even brief interictal spikes produced widespread alterations in cerebellar activity. Changes were noted in the anterior and posterior cerebellum, along the midline, and both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the seizure focus. Remarkably, changes in the cerebellum also occurred prior to any noticeable change in the hippocampal electrographic recordings, suggesting a special relationship between the cerebellum and hippocampal epileptiform activity.

This evolutionary radiation has been accompanied by substantial dietary shifts, often characterized by phenotypic modifications encompassing morphological, metabolic and behavioral changes. Hence, these endemic spiders represent an excellent model for understanding the evolutionary drivers and to pinpoint the genomic determinants underlying adaptive radiations. Recently, we achieved the first chromosome-level genome assembly of one of the endemic species, D. silvatica, providing a high-quality reference sequence for evolutionary genomics studies. Here, we conducted a low-coverage based resequencing study of a natural population of D. silvatica from La Gomera island. Taking advantage of the new high-quality genome, we characterized genome-wide levels of nucleotide polymorphism, divergence, and linkage disequilibrium, and inferred the demographic history of this population. We also performed comprehensive genome-wide scans for recent positive selection. Our findings uncovered exceptionally high levels of nucleotide diversity and recombination in this geographically restricted endemic species, indicative of large historical effective population sizes. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions potentially under positive selection, shedding light on relevant biological processes, such as vision and nitrogen extraction as possible targets of adaptation and eventually, as drivers of the species diversification.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957013

Results demonstrate both wet and semi-dry transfer are compatible with this gel thickness. The major tradeoff is reduced molecular weight resolution, due primarily to less available migration distance per sample.

Here, we present a cell-impermeable small molecule fluorophore, termed Rhobo6, that turns on and red shifts upon reversible binding to glycans. Given that most ECM components are densely glycosylated, the dye enables wash-free visualization of ECM, in systems ranging from in vitro substrates to in vivo mouse mammary tumors. Relative to existing techniques, Rhobo6 provides a broad substrate profile, superior tissue penetration, nonperturbative labeling, and negligible photobleaching.

As the synaptic and transcriptional changes that follow an acute cocaine exposure are mostly resolved within a few days4,5, the molecular changes that encode the long-term cellular memory of the exposure within DNs remain unknown. To investigate whether a single cocaine exposure induces long-term changes in the 3D genome structure of DNs, we applied Genome Architecture Mapping and single nucleus transcriptomic analyses in the mouse midbrain. We found extensive rewiring of 3D genome architecture at 24 hours past exposure which remains or worsens by 14 days, outlasting transcriptional responses. The cocaine-induced chromatin rewiring occurs at all genomic scales and affects genes with major roles in cocaine-induced synaptic changes. A single cocaine exposure triggers extensive long-lasting changes in chromatin condensation in post-synaptic and post-transcriptional regulatory genes, for example the unfolding of Rbfox1 which becomes most prominent 14 days post exposure. Finally, structurally remodeled genes are most expressed in a specific DN sub-type characterized by low expression of the dopamine auto-receptor Drd2, a key feature of highly cocaine-sensitive cells. These results reveal an important role for long-lasting 3D genome remodelling in the cellular memory of a single cocaine exposure, providing new hypotheses for understanding the inception of drug addiction and 3D genome plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

The genetics, biophysics and evolution of hydrophobic cores are not well understood, in part because of a lack of systematic experimental data on sequence combinations that do - and do not - constitute stable and functional cores. Here we randomize protein hydrophobic cores and evaluate their stability and function at scale. The data show that vast numbers of amino acid combinations can constitute stable protein cores but that these alternative cores frequently disrupt protein function because of allosteric effects. These strong allosteric effects are not due to complicated, highly epistatic fitness landscapes but rather, to the pervasive nature of allostery, with many individually small energy changes combining to disrupt function. Indeed both protein stability and ligand binding can be accurately predicted over very large evolutionary distances using additive energy models with a small contribution from pairwise energetic couplings. As a result, energy models trained on one protein can accurately predict core stability across hundreds of millions of years of protein evolution, with only rare energetic couplings that we experimentally identify limiting the transplantation of cores between highly diverged proteins.

Here we use cryo-EM to reveal the mechanistic basis for plasmid defense by DdmDE. A cryo-EM structure of the DdmD helicase-nuclease reveals that it adopts an auto-inhibited dimeric architecture. The prokaryotic Argonaute protein DdmE uses a DNA guide to target plasmid DNA. A structure of the DdmDE complex, validated by in vivo mutational studies, shows that DNA binding by DdmE triggers disassembly of the DdmD dimer and loading of monomeric DdmD onto the non-target DNA strand. Finally, in vitro studies reveal that DdmD translocates in the 5 to 3 direction, while partially degrading the plasmid DNA. These findings provide critical insights into the architecture and mechanism of DdmDE systems in plasmid elimination.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

We performed a deep-sequencing experiment using PacBio HiFi reads to obtain metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a pooled human gut microbiome. We performed long-read metagenome assembly using two methods (hifiasm-meta, metMDBG), used improved bioinformatic and proximity ligation binning strategies to cluster contigs and identify MAGs, and developed a novel framework to compare and consolidate MAGs (pb-MAG-mirror). We found proximity ligation binning yielded more MAGs than bioinformatic binning, but our novel comparison framework resulted in higher MAG yields than either binning strategy individually. In total, from 255 Gbp of total HiFi data we produced 595 total MAGs (including 175 high-quality MAGs) using hifiasm-meta, and 547 total MAGs (including 277 high-quality MAGs) with metaMDBG. Hifiasm-meta assembled almost twice as many strain-level MAGs as metaMDBG (246 vs. 156), but both assembly methods produced up to five strains for a species. Approximately 85% of the MAGs were assigned to known species, but we recovered >35 high-quality MAGs that represent uncultured diversity. Based on strict similarity scores, we found 125 MAGs were unequivocally shared across the assembly methods at the strain level, representing [~]22% of the total MAGs recovered per method. Finally, we detected more total viral sequences in the metaMDBG assembly versus the hifiasm-meta assembly ([~]6,700 vs. [~]4,500). Overall, we find the use of HiFi sequencing, improved metagenome assembly methods, and complementary binning strategies is highly effective for rapidly cataloging microbial genomes in complex microbiomes.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Mammals express only one PPTase, thought to localize to the cytoplasm: aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase phosphopantetheinyl transferase (AASDHPPT); raising the question of how mitochondrial proteins are 4PP-modified. We found that AASDHPPT is required for mitochondrial respiration and oxidative metabolism via the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS) pathway. Moreover, we discovered that a pool of AASDHPPT localizes to the mitochondrial matrix via an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence contained within the first 13 amino acids of the protein. Our data show that mitochondrial localization of AASDHPPT is required to support mtFAS function, and further identify two variants in Aasdhppt that are likely pathogenic in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Here we identify molecular players orchestrating this metabolic balance, and uncover a signaling molecule that mediates energy homeostasis during fat depletion. We show tissue-specific depletion of fatty acyl-CoA synthase FASN1 in the Drosophila fat body (FB) causes near complete fat loss and metabolic remodeling that dramatically elevates carbohydrate metabolism, leading to a striking ~20-fold increase in glycogen storage. Proteomics and metabolomics identify key factors necessary for rewiring including glycolysis enzymes and target-of-brain-insulin (tobi). FASN1-deficient flies are viable but starvation sensitive, oxidatively stressed, and infertile. We also identify CG10824/cDIP as upregulated in FASN1-depleted Drosophila. cDIP is a leucine-rich-repeat protein with homology to secreted adipokines that fine-tune energy signaling. We find FB-specific cDIP loss promotes Drosophila adult obesity, and is required for development in the absence of FASN1-dependent lipid storage. Collectively, we show fat-depleted Drosophila rewire their metabolism to complete development, and identify cDIP as a putative new cytokine that signals fat insufficiency and may regulate energy homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

While immune elicitors trigger changes in plasmodesmal aperture, it is unknown how this contributes towards a full immune response. To investigate this, we developed two transgenic lines with which we could induce plasmodesmal closure independently of immune elicitors. Thus, we used the over-active CALLOSE SYNTHASE3 allele icals3m and the C- terminus of PDLP1 to drive callose deposition at plasmodesmata in response to estradiol treatment. These lines showed different degrees of plasmodesmal closure but both showed upregulation of the expression of stress responsive genes, the accumulation of salicylic acid and enhanced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 in response to estradiol treatment. Enhanced resistance was not correlated with perturbation of the flg22-triggered ROS burst or MAPK signaling. Enhanced plasmodesmal closure using icals3m also led to the measurable accumulation of starch and sugars, decreased leaf growth, and induced leaf senescence. Additionally, induction of plasmodesmal closure using icals3m led to hypersusceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. We conclude that plasmodesmal closure itself can activate stress signaling, raising questions of how this occurs, what signal carries this information and whether these responses occur in all circumstances when plasmodesmata close across plant physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Above the optimal plant growth range, plant immunity and in particular immune responses induced by nucleotide-binding leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are dampened, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remains elusive. NLRs usually contain an N-terminal signaling domain, such as Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, which is self-sufficient to trigger immune signaling. By using inducible Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing TIR-containing NLRs (TNLs) or corresponding isolated TIR domains from Arabidopsis RPS4 and flax L6 NLRs, we showed that immune signaling induced downstream of TNL activation is not affected by an elevation of temperature. Conditional activation of TNL- and isolated TIR-mediated immune responses follow the same signaling route at permissive temperature (EDS1/RNLs requirement and activation of the salicylic acid sector). Yet, this signaling pathway is maintained under elevated temperature (30C) when induced by isolated TIRs, but not full-length TNLs. This work underlines the need to further study how NLRs are impacted by an increase of temperature, which is particularly important to improve the resilience of plant disease resistance in a warming climate.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

As most data have been limited to chaired and typically head-restrained animals, the synergistic interactions of different motor actions/plans inherent to active sensing e.g. eyes, head, posture, movement, etc. on visual perception are largely unknown. To address this considerable gap in knowledge, we developed an innovative wireless head-mounted eye tracking system called CEREBRO for small mammals, such as marmoset monkeys. Our system performs Chair-free Eye-Recording using Backpack mounted micROcontrollers. Because eye illumination and environment lighting change continuously in natural contexts, we developed a segmentation artificial neural network to perform robust pupil tracking in these conditions. Leveraging this innovative system to investigate active vision, we demonstrate that although freely-moving marmosets exhibit frequent compensatory eye movements equivalent to other primates, including humans, the predictability of the visual system is enhanced when animals are freely-moving relative to when they are head-fixed. Moreover, despite increases in eye/head-motion during locomotion, gaze stabilization actually improved over periods when the monkeys were stationary. Rather than impair vision, the dynamics of gaze stabilization in freely-moving primates has been optimized over evolution to enable active sensing during natural exploration.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

But autoregressive models do not inherently require their inputs and outputs to be discrete.

We discovered numerous uncharacterized phage proteins are produced during phage infection of Enterococcus faecalis. Additionally, we identified hundreds of changes in bacterial protein abundances during infection. One such protein, enterococcal gelatinase (GelE), an fsr quorum sensing regulated protease involved in biofilm formation and virulence, was reduced during VPE25 infection. Plaque assays showed that mutation of either the fsrA or gelE resulted in plaques with a ""halo"" morphology and significantly larger diameters, suggesting decreased protection from phage infection. GelE-associated protection during phage infection is dependent on the murein hydrolase regulator LrgA and antiholin-like protein LrgB, whose expression have been shown to be regulated by GelE. Our work may be leveraged in the development of phage therapies that can modulate the production of GelE thereby altering biofilm formation and decreasing E. faecalis virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

A primary driver of cardiovascular mortality is ischemic heart failure, a form of cardiac dysfunction that develops in patients who survive myocardial infarction. Acute cardiac damage triggers robust changes in the spleen with rapid migration of immune cells from the spleen to the heart. Activating this cardio-splenic axis contributes to progressive cardiac dysfunction. The cardio-splenic axis has, therefore, been identified as a promising therapeutic target to prevent or treat heart failure. However, our understanding of the precise mechanisms by which specific immune cells contribute to adverse cardiac remodeling within the cardio-splenic axis remains limited. Here, we show that splenic B cells contribute to the development of heart failure via MHC II-mediated antigen presentation. We found that the transfer of splenic B cells from mice with ischemic heart failure promoted adverse cardiac remodeling and splenic inflammatory changes in naive recipient mice. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of splenic B cells from mice with ischemic heart failure, we hypothesized that B cells contributed to adverse cardiac remodeling through antigen presentation by MHC II molecules. This mechanism was confirmed using transgenic mice with B cell-specific MHC II deletion and by analyzing circulating B cells from humans who experienced myocardial infarction. Our results broaden our understanding of B lymphocyte biology, reshape current models of immune activation in response to cardiac injury, and point towards MHC II-mediated signaling in B cells as a novel and specific therapeutic target in chronic heart failure.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

MP20 forms tetramers each of which contain 4 transmembrane alpha-helices that are packed against one another forming a helical bundle. Both the N- and C- termini of MP20 are cytoplasmic. We found that each MP20 tetramer formed adhesive interactions with an opposing tetramer in a head-to-head fashion. These interactions were mediated by the extracellular loops of the protein. The dimensions of the MP20 adhesive junctions are consistent with the 11 nm thin lens junctions. Investigation of MP20 localization in human lenses indicated that in young fiber cells MP20 was stored intracellularly in vesicles and upon fiber cell maturation MP20 inserted into the plasma membrane and restricted the extracellular space.

Unexpectedly, we discovered this capability in cyanobacteria, unicellular prokaryotes with generation times of only 5-6 h. Cyanobacteria in short winter-like days develop enhanced resistance to cold that involves desaturation of membrane lipids and differential programs of gene transcription, including stress response pathways.

In mature root regions, endodermal cells coat their cell surface in a hydrophobic polymer termed suberin, which blocks solute transport across the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, specific cells adjacent to the water-conducting xylem remain unsuberized. These are termed ""passage cells"" based on the assumption that they create a ""passage"" for nutrient influx into vasculature in the otherwise sealed-off root regions. The identity and function of passage cells remain unknown, but their presence proposes the existence of individual identities within the endodermis. In this study, we probe this by performing an in-depth investigation of passage cells and endodermal suberization in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Our work identifies the transcription factor MYB68 as a key regulator of suberization and endodermal lineage-specification related to passage cell formation. Through transcriptional profiling of myb68 mutants, we unravel genes with passage cell-associated expression that suggest a function in cation homeostasis. Collectively, our findings create a framework for a deeper understanding of radial cell identities within the endodermis and highlight that dynamic spatiotemporal patterning is an important physiological feature of root ground tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Serine integrases can perform the necessary molecular steps4, but only if their natural target site is first installed into the recipient genome by other methods. A more elegant approach would be to directly reprogram the serine integrase itself to target a desired site endogenous to the genome that is different from the natural recognition site of the integrase5. Here, we describe the development of a platform of Modular Integrases (the MINT platform), a versatile protein-guided genome editing method that can facilitate site-directed targeted integration of synthetic DNA into chromosomal sites. Through a combination of structural modeling, directed evolution, and screening in human cells we have reprogrammed the specificity of the serine integrase Bxb1. We then utilized these reprogrammed Bxb1 variants to enable precise integration of kilobase-sized constructs into multiple endogenous locations within the human genome with up to 35% efficiency and promising genome-wide specificity. We demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the MINT platform by retargeting Bxb1 to the human TRAC and AAVS1 loci where wild-type Bxb1 has no detectable activity.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

The histone variant H2A.Z is an ancestral, essential feature of eukaryotic chromatin linked to transcription. Curiously, it is a transcriptional activator in some species and a repressor in others, suggesting species-specific differences shape its function. Here we engineer H2A.Z sequence variants from diverse eukaryotes into a single host, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, to understand H2A.Zs transcriptional impact. We show that H2A.Z sequences representing more than a billion years of evolution encode functional variation attributable to as little as single amino acid substitutions in the unstructured loop 2 (L2) region of H2A.Zs core domain. We show that L2 binds elongation factor Spt6, with L2 sequence influencing its binding to Spt6 and whether it promotes or restricts transcription elongation.

Here, we conducted functional assessments and deep molecular phenotyping in the aging mouse to demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) treatment attenuates body-wide age-related changes. Apart from improvements in physical and cognitive performance, the age-counteracting effects are prominently evident at multiple omic levels. These span the transcriptomes and DNA methylomes of various tissues, organs and circulating white blood cells, as well as the plasma metabolome. Importantly, the beneficial effects are specific to aged mice, not young adults, and are achieved with a low dosage of GLP-1RA which has a negligible impact on food consumption and body weight. The molecular rejuvenation effects exhibit organ-specific characteristics, which are generally heavily dependent on hypothalamic GLP-1R. We benchmarked the GLP-1RA age-counteracting effects against those of mTOR inhibition, a well-established anti-aging intervention, observing a strong resemblance across the two strategies.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms.

Timely identification of the fetal red blood cell antigen genotype for the antigen to which the pregnant person is alloimmunized is vital for determining fetal risk for HDFN and guiding management. Presently in the US, recommended care is to determine fetal antigen genotype with reproductive partner testing and/or amniocentesis. This approach has many limitations, including availability of reproductive partner testing, risk of nonpaternity, and low uptake of invasive testing such as amniocentesis. These barriers to obtaining fetal antigen genotype information lead to pregnancies not at risk for HDFN undergoing burdensome monitoring and, in some cases, unnecessary intervention. PCR-based qualitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping is available in Europe, however, it is offered at later gestational ages, may require a repeat sample, has a higher frequency of inconclusive results for individuals of non-European ancestry, and entails logistical challenges related to shipping and insurance coverage for patients in the US. The availability of a NGS-based quantitative cfDNA analysis for fetal antigen genotyping in the US that is robust for diverse populations and applicable for singleton and twin pregnancies starting at 10 weeks gestation presents an opportunity to assess performance.

MethodsPatients with alloimmunized pregnancies undergoing clinical fetal antigen cfDNA analysis were recruited to the study along with the neonates resulting from the pregnancies. The laboratory issued the results prospectively as a part of clinical care. After delivery, neonatal buccal swabs were sent to an outside laboratory, blinded to the fetal cfDNA results, for antigen genotyping, and the results were compared. Concordance was reported for the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis for antigens to which the pregnant person was alloimmunized as well as for all antigens for which the pregnant person was genotype negative.

ResultsWe observed complete concordance between the fetal antigen cfDNA analysis result and neonatal genotypes for 503 calls, for 100% sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV across a racial and ethnically diverse cohort.

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that cfDNA analysis for determining fetal antigen genotype is more accurate than real-life application of the current recommendations, ie., partner testing and amniocentesis, in a diverse US population. In addition, this noninvasive approach reduces barriers to obtaining timely, accurate information about fetal antigen genotype. These results support the routine implementation of fetal antigen cfDNA analysis to guide care of alloimmunized pregnancies in the US.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957013

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1715810957013

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Although AlphaFold-Multimer (AF-M) has the potential to fill this knowledge gap, standard AF-M confidence metrics do not reliably separate relevant PPIs from an abundance of false positive predictions. To address this limitation, we used machine learning on well curated datasets to train a Structure Prediction and Omics informed Classifier called SPOC that shows excellent performance in separating true and false PPIs, including in proteome-wide screens. We applied SPOC to an all-by-all matrix of nearly 300 human genome maintenance proteins, generating [~]40,000 predictions that can be viewed at predictomes.org, where users can also score their own predictions with SPOC. High confidence PPIs discovered using our approach suggest novel hypotheses in genome maintenance. Our results provide a framework for interpreting large scale AF-M screens and help lay the foundation for a proteome-wide structural interactome.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases. This study focuses on virus surveillance at this interface, combined with culturally responsive science education and community outreach.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Provided that the target complexes may be localised in noisy, three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions, averaging images of multiple instances of these molecules can lead to structures with sufficient resolution for de novo atomic modelling. Although many research groups have contributed image processing tools for these tasks, a lack of standardisation and inter-operability represents a barrier for newcomers to the field. Here, we present an image processing pipeline for electron tomography data in RELION-5, with functionality ranging from the import of unprocessed movies to the automated building of atomic models in the final maps. Our explicit definition of metadata items that describe the steps of our pipeline has been designed for inter-operability with other software tools and provides a framework for further standardisation.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

We report genome-wide data from 78 prehistoric North Pontic individuals to understand the genetic makeup of the people involved in these migrations and discover the reasons for their success. First, we show that native North Pontic foragers had ancestry not only from Balkan and Eastern hunter-gatherers6 but also from European farmers and, occasionally, Caucasus hunter-gatherers. More dramatic inflows ensued during the Eneolithic, when migrants from the Caucasus-Lower Volga area7 moved westward, bypassing the local foragers to mix with Trypillian farmers advancing eastward. People of the Usatove archaeological group in the Northwest Pontic were formed ca. 4500 BCE with an equal measure of ancestry from the two expanding groups. A different Caucasus-Lower Volga group, moving westward in a distinct but temporally overlapping wave, avoided the farmers altogether, and blended with the foragers instead to form the people of the Serednii Stih archaeological complex7. A third wave of expansion occurred when Yamna descendants of the Serednii Stih forming ca. 4000 BCE expanded during the Early Bronze Age (3300 BCE). The temporal gap between Serednii Stih and the Yamna expansion is bridged by a genetically Yamna individual from Mykhailivka in Ukraine (3635-3383 BCE), a site of uninterrupted archaeological continuity across the Eneolithic-Bronze Age transition, and the likely epicenter of Yamna formation. Each of these three waves propagated distinctive ancestries while also incorporating outsiders during its advance, a flexible strategy forged in the North Pontic region that may explain its peoples outsized success in spreading their genes and culture across Eurasia3-5,8-10.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1715810957013
