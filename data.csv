The aim of the reCOVer trial was to investigate safety, tolerability and clinical effects of BC007 on fatigue, its severity and quality of life in PCS patients. Methods: reCOVer is a prospective, exploratory, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase IIa clinical trial with 1350 mg BC007 at the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, Germany. Eligible participants were 18-80 years with GPCR-fAAb, whose PCS symptoms persisted [&ge;]3 months after PCR-confirmed COVID-19, with fatigue as the major symptom (Bell score [&le;]60) and at least three of eight defined PCS symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) according to a crossover design to either receive BC007 (sequence A) or placebo (sequence B) at day 0 and day 48 with a follow-up of 28 days, respectively. A crossover design was chosen to increase patient adherence. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in comparison between sequence A and B from d0 to d28 and d0 to d70 were the primary and co-primary endpoint, respectively. Findings: Between 31.10.2023 and 12.06.2024, 30 PCS patients were randomised and analysed. The trial has been concluded. Summarizing all AE rates, no statistically significant differences between sequence A und sequence B were observed within day 28 and day 70. One report of a serious adverse event, not related to treatment, was recorded. As a secondary endpoint, BC007 showed a significant improvement on self-reported fatigue and its severity, as well as quality of life. Interpretation: As BC007 was well tolerated and showed a significant improvement of fatigue and quality of life, it might offer a therapeutic option for an autoimmune subgroup of PCS patients.

We found a 44% lower relative incidence of all-cause deaths in the first three weeks after the primary vaccination compared to more than three weeks after vaccination (IRR 0.56, 95%CI 0.54-0.57). This lower incidence was consistent across vaccine types, doses, genders, age groups, and individuals with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or comorbidities, and for non-COVID-19 related deaths. For booster vaccinations, the relative incidence was similar (IRR 0.49, 95%CI 0.49-0.50).

The predictive role of gut microbiome composition during acute infection in the development of LC is not well understood, partly due to the heterogeneous nature of disease. We conducted a longitudinal study of 799 outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (380 positive, 419 negative) and found that individuals who later developed LC harbored distinct gut microbiome compositions during acute infection, compared with both SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals who did not develop LC and negative controls with similar symptomatology. However, the temporal changes in gut microbiome composition between the infectious (0-1 month) and post-infectious (1-2 months) phases was not different between study groups. Using machine learning, we showed that microbiome composition alone more accurately predicted LC than clinical variables. Including clinical data only marginally enhanced this prediction, suggesting that microbiome profiles during acute infection may reflect underlying health status and immune responses thus, help predicting individuals at risk for LC. Finally, we identified four LC symptom clusters, with gastrointestinal and fatigue-only groups most strongly linked to gut microbiome alterations.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

While this is a respiratory virus, one feature of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was recognized to cause pathogenesis of other organs. Because the membrane fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein, binds to its major host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that regulates a critical mediator of cardiovascular diseases, angiotensin II, COVID-19 is largely associated with vascular pathologies. In fact, we have previous reported that postmortem lung tissues collected from patients who died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls and reduced vascular lumen. The present study extended these findings by further characterizing the pulmonary vasculature of COVID-19 patients using larger sample sizes and providing mechanistic information through histological observations. The examination of 56 autopsy lung samples showed thickened vascular walls of small pulmonary arteries after 14 days of disease compared to H1N1 influenza patients who died before COVID-19 pandemic started. Pulmonary vascular remodeling in COVID-19 patients was associated with hypertrophy of the smooth muscle layer, perivascular fibrosis, edema and lymphostasis, inflammatory infiltration, perivascular hemosiderosis and neoangiogenesis. We found a correlation between the duration of hospital stay and the thickness of the muscular layer of pulmonary arterial walls. These results further confirm that COVID-19 affects the pulmonary vasculature and warrants an evaluation of patients that survived COVID-19 for possible future development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

The deposition of H3K36me3 occurs co-transcriptionally when the methyltransferase SETD2 associates with RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Here we present three cryo-EM structures of SETD2 bound to Pol II elongation complexes at different states of nucleosome passage. Together with functional probing, our results suggest a 3-step mechanism of transcription-coupled H3K36me3 deposition. First, binding to the elongation factor SPT6 tethers the catalytic SET domain in proximity to the upstream DNA. Second, Pol II nucleosome passage leads to the transfer of a hexasome from downstream to upstream, poised for methylation. Finally, continued transcription leads to upstream nucleosome reassembly, partial dissociation of the histone chaperone FACT and sequential methylation of both H3 tails, completing H3K36me3 deposition of an upstream nucleosome after Pol II passage.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1734300521969

Scotland records up to 6 different diagnostic codes for one inpatient episode, compared with up to 20 in England, and 14 in Wales. We assessed the impact of the variations in diagnostic coding among countries on observed disease incidence rates. Methods: We examined the number of diagnoses coded by each country, and then compared the incidence of three diseases between countries: Parkinson's disease (PD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and dementia. We constructed Cox models for each disease, adjusting for ""country"". Results: England appears to have the highest risk (hazard ratio, HR) for all three diseases, while Scotland appears to have the lowest risk: HR [95% CI] = 0.62 [0.54, 0.72] for PD, 0.49 [0.45, 0.54] for T2D, and 0.88 [0.78, 0.99] for dementia. Conclusions: The observed incidence of these diseases and the estimated effect of ""country"" in Cox models are likely influenced by the clinical coding variations among countries.

The input area V1 contains neurons that encode basic visual features, whereas downstream in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons acquire tuning for novel complex feature associations. It has been assumed that each cortical area is composed of repeatable neuronal subtypes, and variations in synaptic strength and connectivity patterns underlie functional specialization. Here we test the hypothesis that diversity in the intrinsic make-up of single neurons contributes to area specialization along the visual pathways. We measured morphological and electrophysiological properties of single neurons in areas V1 and LPFC of marmosets. Excitatory neurons in LPFC were larger, less excitable, and fired broader spikes than V1 neurons. Some inhibitory fast spiking interneurons in the LPFC had longer axons and fired spikes with longer latencies and a more depolarized action potential trough than in V1. Intrinsic bursting was found in subpopulations of both excitatory and inhibitory LPFC but not V1 neurons. The latter may favour temporal summation of spikes and therefore enhanced synaptic plasticity in LPFC relative to V1. Our results show that specialization within the primate visual system permeates the most basic processing level, the single neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Cardiac NCCs play a critical role in heart development by orchestrating outflow tract septation, valve formation, aortic arch artery patterning, parasympathetic innervation, and maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Abnormal migration, proliferation, or differentiation of cardiac NCCs can lead to severe congenital cardiovascular malformations. However, the complexity and timing of early embryonic heart development pose significant challenges to studying the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac pathologies. Here, we present a sophisticated functional model of human heart assembloids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which, for the first time, recapitulates cardiac NCC integration into the human embryonic heart in vitro. NCCs successfully integrated at developmentally relevant stages into heart organoids, and followed developmental trajectories known to occur in the human heart. They demonstrated extensive migration, differentiated into cholinergic neurons capable of generating nerve impulses, and formed mature glial cells. Additionally, they contributed to the mesenchymal populations of the developing outflow tract. Through transcriptomic analysis, we revealed that NCCs acquire molecular features of their cardiac derivatives as heart assembloids develop. NCC-derived parasympathetic neurons formed functional connections with cardiomyocytes, promoting the maturation of the cardiac conduction system. Leveraging this models cellular complexity and functional maturity, we uncovered that early exposure of NCCs to antidepressants harms the development of NCC derivatives in the context of the developing heart. The commonly prescribed antidepressant Paroxetine disrupted the expression of a critical early neuronal transcription factor, resulting in impaired parasympathetic innervation and functional deficits in cardiac tissue. This advanced heart assembloid model holds great promise for high-throughput drug screening and unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying NCC-related cardiac formation and congenital heart defects.

IN BRIEFHuman neural crest heart assembloids resembling the major directions of neural crest differentiation in the human embryonic heart, including parasympathetic innervation and the mesenchymal component of the outflow tract, provide a human-relevant embryonic platform for studying congenital heart defects and drug safety.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we define the individual and combined contribution of KAT6A, KAT6B and KAT7, in MLL-FP leukaemia. Whilst inhibition of KAT6A/B is efficacious in some pre-clinical models, simultaneous targeting of KAT7, with the novel inhibitor PF-9363, increases the therapeutic efficacy. KAT7 interacts with Menin and the MLL complex and is co-localised at chromatin to co-regulate the MLL-FP transcriptional program. Inhibition of KAT6/KAT7 provides an orthogonal route to targeting Menin to disable the transcriptional activity of MLL-FP. Consequently, combined inhibition rapidly evicts the MLL-FP from chromatin, potently represses oncogenic transcription and overcomes primary resistance to Menin inhibitors. Moreover, PF-9363 or genetic depletion of KAT7 can also overcome acquired genetic/non-genetic resistance to Menin inhibition. These data provide the molecular rationale for rapid clinical translation of combination therapy in MLL-FP leukaemia.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

While the Golgi apparatus plays a central role in lysosomal enzyme sorting, the mechanisms linking Golgi function to lysosomal activity remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify the Golgi-resident protein GRASP55, but not its paralog GRASP65, as a key regulator of lysosome function. More specifically, we demonstrate that loss of GRASP55 expression leads to missorting and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, lysosomal dysfunction and bloating. GRASP55 deficiency also disrupts lysosomal mTORC1 signaling, reducing the phosphorylation of its lysosomal substrates, TFEB and TFE3, while sparing its non-lysosomal targets. Mechanistically, GRASP55 interacts with GNPTAB, a critical enzyme required for mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) tagging of lysosomal enzymes, and is necessary for its correct trafficking and stability. These findings reveal an essential role for GRASP55 in Golgi-lysosome communication and lysosomal enzyme trafficking, and suggest that GRASP55/GORASP2 may act as a susceptibility gene for lysosomal storage disorder (LSD)-like conditions. Overall, this work underscores the importance of Golgi-mediated protein sorting in lysosome function and lysosomal mTORC1 signaling, and provides insights into the molecular basis of LSD-related pathologies.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

This has led to a focus on using only gene families with a single gene-copy per species, as these families are likely to be composed of orthologs. However, recent work has demonstrated that phylogenetic inference using paralogs is accurate and allows researchers to take advantage of more data. Here, we investigate a case in which using larger gene families actually increases accuracy compared to using single-copy genes alone. Long-branch attraction is a phenomenon in which taxa with long branches may be incorrectly inferred as sister taxa due to homoplasy. The most common solution to long-branch attraction is to increase taxon sampling to break up long branches. Sampling additional taxa is not always feasible, perhaps due to extinction or access to high-quality DNA. We propose the use of larger gene families with additional gene copies to break up long branches. Using simulations, we demonstrate that using larger gene families mitigates the impacts of long-branch attraction across large regions of parameter space. We also analyze data from Chelicerates, with a focus on assessing support for a sister relationship between scorpions and pseudoscorpions. Previous work has suggested that the failure to recover this relationship is due to long-branch attraction between pseudoscorpions and other lineages. Using data from larger gene families increases support for a clade uniting scorpions and pseudoscorpions, further highlighting the potential utility of these gene families in phylogenetic inference.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Going beyond prior research, we employed advanced information-theoretic analyses, including mutual information (MI) and co-information (co-I), alongside event-related potential (ERP) and temporal generalization analyses (TGA), to characterize auditory prediction error processing across wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesized that a shared neural code would be present across sleep stages, with deeper sleep being associated with reduced information content and increased information redundancy.

To investigate this, twenty-nine young healthy participants were exposed to an auditory  local-global oddball paradigm during wakefulness and continued during an 8-hour sleep opportunity monitored via polysomnography. We focused on  local mismatch responses to a deviating fifth tone following four standard tones.

ERP analyses showed that prediction error processing continued throughout all sleep stages (N1-N3, REM). Mutual information analyses revealed a substantial reduction in the amount of encoded prediction error information during sleep, although ERP amplitudes increased with deeper NREM sleep. In addition, co-information analyses showed that neural dynamics became increasingly redundant with increasing sleep depth. Temporal generalisation analyses revealed a largely shared neural code between N2 and N3 sleep, although it differed between wakefulness and sleep.

Here, we showed how the neural code of the  sentinel processing mode changes from wake to light to deep sleep and REM, characterised by more redundant and less rich neural information in the human cortex as consciousness wanes. This altered stimulus processing reveals how neural information changes with the changes of consciousness states as we traverse the night.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

This difference in organic preservation was also confirmed by FTIR analysis. Studying similar datasets from seven prehistoric and historical sites, we found a similar age-related difference in only one cemetery.

Among multiple cellular roles of RAD52, its functions in homologous recombination repair and protection of stalled replication forks appear to substitute those of the tumor suppressor protein BRCA2. However, the mechanistic details of how RAD52 can substitute BRCA2 functions are only beginning to emerge. RAD52 forms an undecameric ring that is enveloped by eleven [~]200 residue-long disordered regions, making it a highly multivalent and branched protein complex that potentiates supramolecular assembly. Here, we show that RAD52 exhibits homotypic phase separation capacity, and its condensates recruit key players in homologous recombination such as single-stranded (ss)DNA, RPA, and the RAD51 recombinase. Moreover, we show that RAD52 phase separation is regulated by its interaction partners such as ssDNA and RPA. Using fluorescence microscopy, we show that RAD52 can induce the formation of RAD51-ssDNA fibrillar structures. To probe the fine structure of these fibrils, we utilized single-molecule super-resolution imaging via DNA-PAINT and atomic force microscopy and showed that RAD51 fibrils are bundles of individual RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. We further show that RAD52 induces end-to-end tethering of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Overall, we demonstrate unique macromolecular organizational features of RAD52 that may underlie its various functions in the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

In the present paper we test whether population differences in genetic nurture, assortative mating, or population stratification contribute to the fact that polygenic indices constructed based on GWAS results from European-descent samples predict more poorly in admixed populations with Native American and African ancestry. We do this by comparing the rates of decline in prediction accuracy of classical-GWAS-based PGIs versus within-family-based PGIs, each estimated in a population of European descent, as they are deployed in two samples of Latino Americans and African Americans. Within-family GWAS putatively eliminates the effects of parental genetic nurture, assortative mating, and population stratification; thus, we can determine whether without those confounding factors in the PGI construction, the relative prediction accuracy in the out-groups is ameliorated. Results show that relative prediction accuracy is not improved, suggesting that the differences across groups can be almost entirely explained by variation in genetic architecture (i.e. allele frequencies and short-range LD) rather than the aforementioned factors. Additional analysis of the impact of genetic architecture on the decline in prediction accuracy supports this conclusion. Future researchers should test within-family analysis at the prediction rather than the discovery stage.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Since they can suppress pathogen replication and spread rapidly through insect populations, Wolbachia is at the vanguard of public health initiatives to control mosquito-borne diseases. Wolbachias abilities to block pathogens and spread quickly are closely linked to their abundance in host tissues. The most common method for counting Wolbachia is quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), yet qPCR can be insufficient to count rare Wolbachia, necessitating tissue pooling and consequently compromising individual-level resolution of Wolbachia dynamics. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) offers superior sensitivity, enabling the detection of rare targets and eliminating the need for sample pooling. Here, we report three ddPCR assays to measure total Wolbachia abundance, Wolbachia abundance adjusted for DNA extraction efficiency, and Wolbachia density relative to host genome copies. Using Drosophila melanogaster with wMel Wolbachia as a model, we show these ddPCR assays can reliably detect as few as 7 to 12 Wolbachia gene copies in a 20 L reaction. The designed oligos are homologous to sequences from at least 106 Wolbachia strains across Supergroup A and 53 host species from the Drosophila, Scaptomyza, and Zaprionus genera, suggesting broad utility. These highly sensitive ddPCR assays are expected to significantly advance Wolbachia-host interactions research by enabling the collection of molecular data from individual insect tissues.

Nsp14 also modulates host functions. This includes the activation of NF-{kappa}B and downregulation of interferon alpha/beta receptor 1 (IFNAR1). Here we demonstrate that Nsp14 exerts broader effects, activating not only NF-{kappa}B responses but also ERK, p38 and JNK MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling, promoting cytokine production. Further, Nsp14 downregulates not only IFNAR1 but also IFN-{gamma} receptor 1 (IFNGR1), impairing cellular responses to both IFN and IFN{gamma}. IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 downregulation is via a lysosomal pathway and also occurs in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Analysis of a panel of Nsp14 mutants reveals a consistent pattern. Mutants that disable ExoN function remain active, whereas N7-MTase mutations impair both pro-inflammatory pathway activation and IFN receptor downregulation. Innate immune modulating functions also require the presence of both the ExoN and N7-MTase domains likely reflecting the need for the ExoN domain for N7-MTase activity. We further identify multi-functional host protein Tollip as an Nsp14 interactor. Interaction requires the phosphoinositide-binding C2 domain of Tollip and sequences C-terminal to the C2 domain. Full length Tollip or regions encompassing the Nsp14 interaction domain are sufficient to counteract both Nsp14-mediated and Nsp14-independent activation of NF-{kappa}B.

At moderate sequencing depth, Hi-C is sensitive enough to detect interactions occurring in 5-10% of cells. It also shows no inherent bias toward intra- versus inter-chromosomal interactions. Furthermore, we observe a linear relationship between Hi-C signal intensity and contact frequency. These findings illuminate the intrinsic properties of the Hi-C assay and provide a robust framework for its calibration.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Here we conducted data synthesis to better understand the extinction factors of the iconic Jambato Harlequin frog, Atelopus ignescens, which was widespread in the Ecuadorian Andes before 1985 but vanished in 1988. The mechanism of extinction remains elusive, as it was uncertain whether Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) fungus infection, climate change, or the interaction of the two factors primarily contributed to the rapid population decline. Here we synthesize historical data from natural history museums, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and mitochondrial DNA sequences to uncover the factors that have potentially contributed to the extinction of the Jambato Harlequin frog. We found excessive rare alleles reflected in the negative Tajimas D estimated from the mitochondrial DNA samples collected in 1984, which indicates a selective sweep or bottleneck in the population shortly before the historical extinction. There was a marginal effect of the time before versus during Bd epizootics on the body sizes of the adult males, which was relatively weaker than the sex effect and geographic effect. The body size of adult males, but not the females form a geographic cline where the individuals in the northeast were larger than the males in the southwest. Species distribution modeling based on temperature and precipitation accurately predicted the occupancy of A. ignescens in 1960-69 (R2 = 0.72, accuracy = 0.9). This model further predicted the rapid decline in species distribution over decades of climate change between 1970-2020, which could have contributed to the rapid population decline in the 1980s. Collectively, our data synthesis revealed a strong climate effect and a weak epizootics effect on A. ignescens extinction, which unravels the mysterious rapid population decline and informs ongoing conservation efforts. This investigation inspires future museum genomic studies to dissect the potential climatic maladaptation behind one of the most dramatic extinction events in modern history.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Two of these subclasses align with physiological expectations based on synaptic plasticity: large AMPAR-rich synapses may represent potentiated synapses, whereas small NMDAR-rich synapses suggest ""silent"" synapses.

Neutrophil activation is regulated, in part, by dynamic changes in gene expression. In this study we have used RNAseq to measure the transcriptomes of neutrophils from people with severe, methotrexate-refractory RA and healthy controls. We identified a dynamic gene expression profile in people with severe RA. This is dominated by a type-I interferon-induced gene expression signature as well as activation of genes regulating neutrophil degranulation, NET production, response to ROS and oxidative stress. Whilst we did not detect significantly elevated levels of interferon-alpha in RA blood sera, we identified increased expression in RA neutrophils of miR-96-5p and miR-183-5p which regulate activation of the interferon pathway as members of the miR-183C cluster. We also detected significantly elevated NET debris in RA blood sera (p<0.05). Using gene set variation analysis we explored the heterogeneity of neutrophil gene expression in RA and identified subsets of patients with gene expression profiles reflecting enhanced neutrophil degranulation and cytotoxicity, tissue inflammation or activation by interferons. Comparison with published single-cell RNAseq datasets identified RA transcriptomes where neutrophils were polarised by genes relating to early or late cell maturity, with significant genes in each polarised state being regulated by miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-183-5p or miR-96-5p.

Two emerging intuitive mental paradigms, Visual Imagery (VI) and Imagined Speech (IS) show promise to optimise the development of non-invasive BCIs, which involves the extraction of corresponding neural patterns during the imagined tasks. This study took a comprehensive user-centric approach to build on the current foundation of knowledge on VI and IS EEG-BCIs utilising an adapted 1D-CNN to optimise the classification decoding performance. Twenty healthy participants were assessed for their ability to visualise imagery in their minds and performed the VI and IS mental paradigms in two class conditions ''push'' and ''relax''. It was shown that alpha and beta suppression was observed during the ''push'' condition of VI compared to the ''relax'' condition, and those that scored higher in the VVIQ had better VI classification accuracy than those who did not. The adapted 1D-CNN model performed well for classification between the two classes ''push'' and ''relax'' at 89.3% and 77.87% performance accuracy for VI and IS, respectively. These findings contribute to the current body of work on VI BCI, that it is a dynamic and plausible option compared to standard BCI paradigms, and VI BCI illiteracy could potentially be controlled by VVIQ.

Clinical studies suggest that alterations in serotonin signalling such as genetic polymorphisms or antidepressant exposure during pregnancy are risk factors for neurodevelopmental disorders. However, an understanding of how dysfunctional neuromodulation alters systems level activity over neocortical development is lacking. Here, we use a longitudinal imaging approach to investigate how genetics, pharmacology, and aversive experience disrupt state-dependent serotonin signalling with pathological consequences for sensory processing. We find that all three factors lead to increased neocortical serotonin levels during the initial postnatal period. Genetic deletion of the serotonin transporter or antidepressant dosing results in a switch from hypo- to hyper-cortical activity that arises as a consequence of altered cortical GABAergic microcircuitry. However, the trajectories of these manipulations differ with postnatal exposure to antidepressants having effects on adult sensory encoding. The latter is not seen in the genetic model despite a similar early phenotype, and a distinct influence of maternal genotype on the development of supragranular layers. These results reveal the dynamics and critical nature of serotonin signalling during perinatal life; pharmacological targeting of which can have profound life-long consequences for cognitive development of the offspring.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

We demonstrate that CD39+ Treg-like and CD26hi Th22-like cells can be activated by cytokines in a TCR-independent manner during in vitro Ag stimulation, leading to non-specific upregulation of prototypical AIM readouts. Transcriptional analysis of memory CD4+ T cells that underwent TCR-dependent or -independent activation enabled discrimination of bona fide Ag-specific T cells from cytokine-activated Treg and Th22 cells. CXCR4 downregulation emerged as a hallmark of clonotypic expansion and TCR-dependent activation in memory CD4+ T cells and cTfh. Tracking tetramer-binding cells during re-stimulation showed that CXCR4-CD137+ cells provide a more accurate measure of the Ag-specific population than standard AIM readouts. This modified assay excludes the predominately CCR6+ cytokine-activated T cells that contribute to an average 12-fold overestimation of the Ag-specific population.

However, the identification of individual cells in brightfield images remains a significant challenge. Traditional intensity-based segmentation algorithms perform poorly when identifying individual cells in dense colonies due to a lack of contrast between neighboring cells. Here, we describe a newly developed software package called Cypose which uses machine learning (ML) models to solve two specific tasks: segmentation of individual cyanobacterial cells, and classification of cellular phenotypes. The segmentation models are based on the Cellpose framework, while classification is performed using a convolutional neural network named Cyclass. To our knowledge, these are the first developed ML-based models for cyanobacteria segmentation and classification. When compared to other methods, our segmentation models showed improved performance and were able to segment cells with varied morphological phenotypes, as well as differentiate between live and lysed cells. We also found that our models were robust to imaging artifacts, such as dust and cell debris. Additionally, the classification model was able to identify different cellular phenotypes using only images as input. Together, these models improve cell segmentation accuracy and enable high-throughput analysis of dense cyanobacterial colonies and filamentous cyanobacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

How the two disparate processes of Lpp maturation and DNA replication are connected remains unclear. We demonstrate that upon membrane-stress the Rcs stress-response pathway is activated and the replication initiator DnaA is lost, which explains the replication block. However, the Lon protease, a key regulator of the Rcs pathway, is not required for the DnaA loss. We further ruled out the involvement of (p)ppGpp, one of the major mediators of stress-response in bacteria. However, upon deletion of the ClpP protease gene, DnaA was stable, replication initiated, and there was no cell-growth arrest. In wildtype cells, overexpression of DnaA was lethal even without the membrane-stress apparently from hyper-initiation. The hyper-initiation was restrained in {Delta}crp cells, and overexpression of DnaA was able to overcome the growth-arrest. {Delta}fis cells, which were earlier found resistant to the membrane-stress, showed DnaA stability and normal replication upon induction of the membrane-stress. We conclude that DnaA loss suffices to explain the growth-arrest upon the membrane-stress. The stress-response pathway described here appears novel because of its independence from Lon and (p)ppGpp, which have been implicated in other stress-responses that block DNA replication.

SignificanceThe seminal observation that DNA replication-stress can block cell division in E. coli (SOS response), introduced the concept of checkpoint control in the cell cycle. Here, we describe a novel checkpoint control that functions in the opposite direction: membrane-stress causing replication block. We show how two apparently unrelated outcomes of reducing a membrane phospholipid, accumulation of a precursor lipoprotein (pLpp) and block of replication initiation, could be linked. The pLpp accumulation stresses the membrane that causes a response culminating in activating the ClpP protease that blocks replication by targeting the initiator DnaA. DnaA being vital and highly conserved, the detail understanding of the response pathway is likely to open new avenues to treat bacterial infection.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

One line of research is the use of synthetic genetic circuits guiding the self-organization of cell ensembles. This approach has led to several recent successes, including control of cellular rearrangements in 3D via control of cell-cell adhesion by user-designed artificial genetic circuits. However, the methods employed to reach such achievements can still be optimized along three lines: identification of circuits happens by hand, 3D structures are spherical, and effectors are limited to cell-cell adhesion. Here we show the identification, in a computational framework, of genetic circuits for volumetric axial elongation via control of proliferation, tissue fluidity, and cell-cell signaling. We then seek to implement this design in mammalian cell aggregates in vitro. We start by identifying effectors to control tissue growth and fluidity in vitro. We then combine these new modules to construct complete circuits that control cell behaviors of interest in space and time, resulting in measurable tissue deformation along an axis that depends on the engineered signaling modules. Finally, we contextualize in vitro and in silico implementations within a unified morphospace to suggest further elaboration of this initial family of circuits towards more robust programmed axial elongation.

We used a V1-V4 Dynamic Causal Model (DCM) to explain visually induced responses in early and late epochs from a sequence of several hundred grating presentations. The DCM reproduced the empirical increase in local and inter-areal gamma synchronization, revealing specific intrinsic connectivity effects that could explain the phenomenon. In a sensitivity analysis, the isolated modulation of several connection strengths induced increased gamma. Comparison of alternative models showed that empirical gamma increases are better explained by (1) repetition effects in both V1 and V4 intrinsic connectivity (alone or together with extrinsic) than in extrinsic connectivity alone, and (2) repetition effects on V1 and V4 population input rather than output gain. The best input gain model included effects in V1 granular and superficial excitatory populations and in V4 granular and deep excitatory populations.

Invasive electrophysiology in both rodents and humans has shown increases in hippocampal theta power immediately before the onset of translational movement that persists throughout subsequent motion, and the magnitude of this increase correlates with the distance subsequently travelled. Using non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) and an abstract navigation task, we observed increased theta power during both spatial planning and subsequent navigation. Importantly, theta power in the right hippocampus covaried with subsequent path distance during planning, only when participants were aware of the distance to their goal. During subsequent navigation, hippocampal theta power decreased dynamically as participants approached the goal, only when they were aware of how far they still needed to travel. In addition, theta phase during navigation modulated 70-140 Hz fast gamma amplitude in the entorhinal cortex while traversing novel paths; and 30-70 Hz slow gamma amplitude in the right hippocampus while traversing previously experienced paths. In both cases, theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling increased with proximity to the goal during navigation, consistent with the hypothesis that sequences of upcoming locations were represented by gamma bursts occurring at successive theta phases. In sum, these findings are consistent with the proposed role of hippocampal theta oscillation in flexible planning and goal-directed spatial navigation across mammalian species.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

This hidden diversity has been shown to influence the study of horizontal gene flow (e.g., introgression and horizontal gene transfer) by complicating the phylogenetic signals commonly used for their detection.

In this work, we explore the potential of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) detection methods based on phylogenies (i.e., reconciliation methods) to reveal and quantify ghost diversity along the branches of a species phylogeny. We succinctly present the theoretical framework for this approach, and we demonstrate, using simple simulations, that HGT signals, as interpreted by a reconciliation method, can reveal the presence and phylogenetic position of ghost clades, despite the absence of genomic data for these taxa. We anticipate possible limitations and difficulties in using HGT detection to explore ghost diversity and suggest promising approaches to address or circumvent them. Altogether, this proof of concept opens new lines of research for the future: a scarce fossil record and a large proportion of unknown lineages, especially in Archaea and Bacteria, does not equate to an absence of information for evolutionary studies.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Deviations in amplitude and timing of APAs exist in Parkinson's disease (PD), causing dysfunctional postural control which increases the risk of falls. The motor cortex and basal ganglia have been implicated in the regulation of postural control, however, their dynamics during gait initiation, relationship to APA metrics, and response to pharmacotherapy such as levodopa are unknown. To address these questions, we streamed electrocorticography (ECoG) potentials from the premotor and primary motor cortices, as well as local field potentials (LFPs) from the globus pallidus in five people with PD exhibiting gait and balance dysfunction during a cued gait initiation task. Amplitude and timing of APA were evaluated with force plates and synchronized to the neural data. Subjects performed gait initiation trials under ON and LOW levodopa conditions to assess effects of medication on APA metrics and underlying neural dynamics. All subjects demonstrated pallidal and cortical oscillatory changes during different phases of gait initiation. Grouped analysis revealed that from quiet standing to the first foot step, pallidal beta power showed stepwise decrease and broadband gamma power increases, whereas cortical potentials showed low frequency (theta, alpha, beta) power decrease during gait initiation, regardless of medication state. The pallidum and motor cortices also became increasingly coherent during gait initiation compared to quiet standing prior to APA onset. Using linear mixed models, we found that while pallidal gamma powers are predictive of APA scaling, pallidal-cortical coherence (theta, alpha, beta) and premotor-M1 gamma coherence are predictive of APA timing. Our study is the first detailed characterization of basal-ganglia cortical circuit dynamics during human gait initiation. We identified significant pallidal motor cortical power and coherence changes that underlie the amplitude and timing of APA which appear to be independent of medication states of the study subjects. Our results provide evidence for a model where synchronized premotor and motor cortical activities transiently couple with the globus pallidus to regulate the timing of postural responses, and local pallidal activity regulate the amplitude of postural changes during gait initiation. It suggests that abnormal pallidal outflow and synchronization between the pallidum and motor cortices may be a pathophysiological mechanism underlying disordered postural response in Parkinson's disease.","NA","medrxiv",1734300521969

Since the early days of germ theory, researchers have categorized bacteria as pathogens or non-pathogens, those that cause harm and those that do not, but this binary view is not always accurate. Vibrio fischeri is an exclusive mutualistic symbiont found within the light organs of Hawaiian bobtail squid. This symbiotic interaction requires V. fischeri to utilize a range of behaviors and produce molecules that are often associated with pathogenicity. This juxtaposition of employing ""pathogenic"" behaviors for a symbiotic relationship led the field to focus on how V. fischeri establishes a beneficial association with its host. In this study, we observe that V. fischeri induces mortality in zebrafish embryos and Artemia nauplii. Non-lethal doses of V. fischeri leads to zebrafish growth delays and phenotypes indicative of disease. Our data also provide evidence that the conserved type VI secretion system on chromosome I (T6SS1) plays a role in the V. fischeri-induced mortality of zebrafish embryos and Artemia nauplii. These results support the hypothesis that the V. fischeri T6SS1 is involved in eukaryotic cell interactions. Despite its traditional view as a beneficial symbiont, we provide evidence that V. fischeri is capable of harming aquatic organisms, indicating its potential to be pathogenic toward non-symbiotic hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

While its ecological interactions and control strategies are well-studied, its associated viral diversity remains unexplored. Here, we employ high-throughput sequencing data mining to comprehensively characterize the L. botrana virome, revealing novel and diverse RNA viruses. We characterized four new viral members belonging to distinct families, with evolutionary cues of cypoviruses (Reoviridae), sobemo-like viruses (Solemoviridae), phasmaviruses (Phasmaviridae), and carmotetraviruses (Carmotetraviridae). Phylogenetic analysis of the cypoviruses places them within the genus in affinity with other moth viruses, suggesting a potential ecological roles and host range within Lepidoptera. The bi-segmented and highly divergent sobemo-like virus showed a distinctive evolutionary trajectory of its encoding proteins at the periphery of recently reported invertebrate Sobelivirales. Notably, the presence of a novel phasmavirus, typically associated with mosquitoes, expands the known host range and diversity of this family to moths. Furthermore, the identification of a carmotetravirus branching in the same cluster of providence virus, a lepidopteran virus which replicates in plants, raises questions regarding the biological significance of this moth virus and grapevine. We further explored viral sequences in several publicly available transcriptomic datasets of the moth, indicating potential prevalence across distinct conditions. These results underscore the existence of a complex virome within L. botrana and lays the foundation for future studies investigating the ecological roles, evolutionary dynamics, and potential biocontrol applications of these viruses on the L. botrana-vineyard ecosystem.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Binding propensity has been shown to be modulated by stabilizing the pre-activated state of arrestin through point mutations or C-tail truncation. Here, we hypothesize that pre-activated rotated states can be stabilized by small molecules, and this can promote binding to phosphorylation-deficient receptors, which underly a variety of human disorders. We performed virtual screening on druggable pockets identified on pre-activated conformations in Molecular Dynamics trajectories of arrestin-3, and found a compound targeting an activation switch, the back loop at the inter-domain interface. According to our model, consistent with available biochemical and structural data, the compound destabilized the ionic lock between the finger and the back loop, and enabled transition of the 'gate loop' towards the pre-activated state, which stabilizes pre-activated inter-domain rotation. The predicted binding pocket is consistent with saturation-transfer difference NMR data indicating close contact between the piperazine moiety of the compound and C/finger loops. The compound increases in-cell arrestin-3 binding to phosphorylation-deficient and wild-type {beta}2-adrenergic receptor, but not to muscarinic M2 receptor, as verified by FRET and NanoBiT.

To what extent is lumen acidification sensed by cytosolic-side molecules that drive endosome maturation? We show here that ""inside-out"" proton signaling through the endosomal Na+/H+ Exchanger 6 (NHE6) activates the late endosome master regulator Rab7. The mechanism involves potent inactivation of the Rab7 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) TBC1D5 with decreasing pH. NHE6 interacts with TBC1D5 in a complex with Rab7. Neurons from NHE6-null mice or mice engineered with a selective defect in NHE6 proton efflux exhibit blocked endosome maturation and decreased active Rab7, consistent with an overactive Rab7 GAP. Finally, epistatic knock-down of TBC1D5, thereby reducing Rab7 GAP activity, in NHE6-null neurons rescues Rab7 GTPase cycling and endosome maturation. Importantly, NHE6 is mutated in Christianson Syndrome underscoring the significance of these mechanisms to neurodegeneration. We conclude that lumen acidification regulates pH-dependent Rab GTPase cycling to coordinate late endosome maturation by a process involving proton signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Among them, 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG), specifically abundant in the famous medicinal plant Pleuropterus multiflorus, exhibits significant pharmacological properties. A selfing progeny of P. multiflorus commercial variety Jinwufugui No.1, which contains high THSG content, was used for genome sequencing. Through the combination of weighted correlation network analysis, genome mining, and enzymatic characterization studies, we identified an unpredicted biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for THSG biosynthesis. This cluster includes a stilbene synthase (PmSTS1), a flavin-containing monooxygenase (PmFMO3), and a UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT72B90). Our findings suggest this stilbenoid gene cluster is formed by transposable element-mediated gene duplications and neofunctionalization, and regulated by MYB and NAC type transcription factors. Notably, PmFMO3, as the first identified stilbenoid-2-hydroxylase, was confirmed that it can modify the other stilbenoids without the A ring modifications. The novel type of gene cluster, in which FMO serves as the key decorating enzyme, will guide the identification of more biosynthetic gene clusters in plants. In addition, the characterization of PmFMO3 extends our understanding of the FMO gene function in plants, and provides an important catalytic bioparts for the heterologous synthesis of polyhydroxylated stilbenoids.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

A negatively charged amino acid in the opsin, acting as a counterion, stabilises the proton on the Schiff base, which is essential for sensitivity to visible light. In this study, we investigate the spectroscopic properties of a unique class of opsins from a reef-building coral belonging to the anthozoan-specific opsin II group (ASO-II opsins), which intriguingly lack a counterion residue at any of established sites. Our findings reveal that, unlike other known animal opsins, the protonated state of the Schiff base in visible light-sensitive ASO-II opsins is highly dependent on exogenously supplied chloride ions (Cl-). By using structural modelling and QM/MM calculations to interpret spectroscopy data, we conclude that, in the dark state, ASO-II opsins employ environmental Cl- as their native counterion, while a nearby polar residue, Glu292 in its protonated neutral form, facilitates Cl- binding. In contrast, Glu292 plays a crucial role in maintaining the protonation state of the Schiff base in the light-activated protein, serving as the counterion in the photoproduct. Furthermore, Glu292 is involved in G protein activation of the ASO-II opsin, suggesting that this novel counterion system coordinates multiple functional properties.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

These introns are believed to be evolutionarily derived from group II introns, which are known to be widespread in bacteria. One prominent hypothesis is that the spliceosomal intron arose after the endosymbiotic origin of the mitochondrion, as a consequence of transfer of genes containing group II introns from the organelle to nuclear genome; in this model, transfer of group II introns into the ancestral eukaryotic genome set the stage for evolution of the spliceosomal form. However, the recent discovery and sequencing of asgard archaea - the closest archaeal relatives of extant eukaryotes - has shed significant light on the composition of the early eukaryotic genome and calls that model into question. Using sequence analysis and structural modeling, we show here the presence of group II intron maturases in the genomes of Heimdallarchaeia and other asgard archaea, and demonstrate by phylogenetic inference that these are closely related to both eukaryotic mitochondrial group II intron maturases and the spliceosome protein PRP8. This suggests that the first intron-containing eukaryotic common ancestor (FIECA) inherited selfish group II introns from its ancestral archaeal genome - the progenitor of the nuclear genome - rather than from the mitochondrial endosymbiont. These observations suggest that the spread and diversification of introns may have occurred independently of the acquisition of the mitochondrion. To better understand the context for intron evolution, we investigate the broader occurrence of group II introns in archaea, identify archaeal clades enriched in group II introns, and perform structural modeling to examine the relationship between the archaeal group II intron maturase and the eukaryotic spliceosome. We propose a model of intron acquisition and expansion during early eukaryotic evolution that places the spread of introns prior to the acquisition of mitochondria, possibly facilitated by the separation of transcription and translation afforded by the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

They notably promote the formation of the perineuronal net, a specialized extracellular matrix that contributes to the maturation of neocortical networks by stabilizing synapses around parvalbumin neurons.

An oral dose response study of M102 in SOD1G93A transgenic mice showed a dose-dependent improvement in the CMAP of hindlimb muscles which correlated with preservation of lumbar spinal motor neurons at the same time point. These data enabled prediction of human efficacious exposures and doses, which were well within the safety margin predicted from Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies. A parallel program of work in vitro showed that M102 rescued motor neuron survival in co-culture with patient-derived astrocytes from sporadic, C9orf72 and SOD1 cases. Markers of oxidative stress, as well as indices of TDP-43 proteinopathy were also reduced by exposure to M102 in these in vitro models.

However, a D1R antagonist depolarized Vm and reduced the input resistance of AII-ACs in wild type mice, but not in Cx36-/- mice. Accordingly, D1R antagonists enhanced tonic glycinergic transmission to type-2 OFF-cone bipolar cells (OFF-CBCs). D1Rs thus adjust the Vm and excitability of AII-ACs and, thereby, the level of glycine release to OFF-CBCs by regulating gap junction coupling with ON cone bipolar cells. Our findings provide insights into how the retina may use dopamine to adapt crossover inhibitory microcircuits during changes in luminance.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

The human genome contains relics from many kinds of ancient ERV. Some relics contributed new genes and regulatory elements. This study finds further kinds of ancient ERV, in the thoroughly-studied human genome version hg38: ERV-Hako, ERV-Saru, ERV-Hou, ERV-Han, and ERV-Goku. It also finds many relics of ERV-V, previously known from just two copies on chromosome 19 with placental genes. It finds a type of ERV flanked by MER41E long terminal repeats (LTRs), with surprisingly little similarity to the known MER41 ERV. ERV-Hako has subtypes that contain sequence from host genes SUSD6 and SPHKAP: the SUSD6 variant was transferred between catarrhine and platyrrhine primates. A retrovirus uses tRNA to prime reverse transcription: Hako is the only human ERV relic that used tRNA-Trp (tryptophan, symbol W), and HERV-W is misnamed because it used tRNA-Arg, based on the Genomic tRNA Database. One ERV-Saru LTR is the previously-described enhancer of AIM2 in innate immunity. This study contributes to understanding primate ERV history, but also shows that related ERVs can have drastic differences, challenging the goal of clearly annotating all ERV relics in genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Pacing is a self-management strategy to mitigate symptoms. Our aim was to describe experiences of pacing from the perspectives of adults living with Long COVID.

MethodsWe conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving one-on-one online interviews with adults living with Long COVID from Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States to explore experiences of disability. We asked participants about strategies they used to deal with health challenges living with Long COVID. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed data using group-based content analytical techniques.

ResultsAmong the 40 participants living with Long COVID, the majority were women (n=25; 63%), white (n=29;73%) and heterosexual (n=30;75%). The median age of participants was 39 years (25th, 75th percentile: 32, 49). Most participants (n=37;93%) used pacing to mitigate or prevent symptoms. Participant described experiences of pacing across five main areas: 1) using pacing as a living strategy (pacing to mitigate multidimensional health challenges; applying pacing to many types of activities; process of pacing experienced as a moving target; pacing experienced as a helpful strategy, but not a cure for Long COVID); 2) learning how to pace (acquiring knowledge about pacing; developing strategies and skills to support pacing); 3) encountering challenges with pacing (learning how to pace; experiencing inequitable access to pacing; experiencing stigma and judgement; undergoing psychological and emotional adjustment from beliefs of  fighting or  pushing through to balancing rest with activity; making sacrifices; and encountering unexpected obstacles); 4) experiencing consequences of not pacing; and 5) conceptualising and describing pacing using analogies or metaphors.

DiscussionPacing is a challenging and complex strategy used to mitigate symptoms of Long COVID. Healthcare providers should work collaboratively with patients to further refine and implement this strategy, when appropriate.","NA","medrxiv",1734300521969

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734300521969

Using a suite of experimental and computational multiscale approaches, we found that aortic expansion is guided by specific biological principles and scales with the vertebral column rather than animal body weight. Expansion proceeds via two distinct waves of arterial cell proliferation along blood flow that are spatially stochastic, yet temporally coordinated. Each wave exhibits unique cell cycle kinetics and properties, with the first wave exhibiting cell cycle durations as fast as 6 hours. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed changes in fatty acid metabolism concomitant with an increase in cell size. Mathematical modeling and experiments indicated endothelial cell extrusion is essential for homeostatic aortic growth and balancing excess proliferation. In a genetic model of achondroplasia, the aorta achieves proper scaling through enhanced cell extrusion while maintaining normal proliferation dynamics. Collectively, these results provide a blueprint of the principles that orchestrate aortic growth which depends entirely on differentiated cell proliferation rather than resident stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

However, measurement of the transcript levels is typically done in homogenized tissues post-mortem. Here, we present a new platform that enables non-invasive monitoring of specific mRNA levels in vivo, without tissue destruction. We achieved this by combining two cutting-edge tools - synthetic serum markers, called Released Markers of Activity (RMAs), and RNA-based sensors of transcription. We call this platform IN-vivo Tracking of ACtive Transcription, or INTACT. In INTACT, when the target mRNA is expressed, the RNA sensor detects it and triggers the production and release of RMA reporters into the blood. Once in blood, the RMAs can be easily measured through a simple blood draw. Our data shows that INTACT can measure transcription of transgenes, as well as endogenous transcripts, such as c-Fos or Arc, both in vivo in the brain and in tissue culture. INTACT enables simple measurement of transcript level histories in genetically-targetable cell populations of living animals.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

In soybean protoplasts and in Arabidopsis plants, Solanum americanum Rpi-amr1, Rpi-amr3 and pepper Bs2 sensor NLRs confer cognate effector responsiveness if co-expressed with NRC helper NLRs. Rice carrying pepper Bs2 and NRCs recognizes the conserved effector, AvrBs2, and resists an important pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola for which no resistance gene is available in rice. Rice lines carrying sensor and helper NLR genes otherwise resemble wild-type, with unaltered basal resistance or field fitness.

Yet insights into dikaryotic fungi that separate their haploid genomes into distinct nuclei is limited. Here we explore the impact of dikaryotism on the genome biology of a long-term asexual clone of the wheat pathogenic fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. We use Oxford Nanopore (ONT) duplex sequencing combined with Hi-C to generate a T2T nuclear-phased assembly with >99.999% consensus accuracy. We show that this fungus has large regional centromeres enriched in LTR retrotransposons with a single centromeric dip in methylation that suggests one kinetochore attachment site per chromosomes. The centromeres of chromosomes pairs are most often highly diverse in sequence and kinetochore attachment sites are not always positionally conserved. Each nucleus carries a unique array of rDNAs with >200 copies that harbour nucleus-specific sequence variations. The inter-haplotype diversity between the two nuclear genomes is caused by large-scale structural variations linked to transposable elements. Nanopore long-read cDNA analysis across distinct infection conditions revealed pervasive allele specific expression for nearly 20% of all heterozygous gene pairs. Genes involved in plant infection were significantly enriched in ASE genes which appears to be mediated by elevated CpG gene body methylation of the lower expressed pair. This suggests that epigenetically regulated ASE is likely a previously overlooked mechanism facilitating plant infection. Overall, our study reveals how dikaryotism uniquely shapes key eukaryotic genome features.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Here we assembled genomes, with phased sex chromosomes, for three XY male hops (Humulus sp.), two XY male Cannabis, and two monoecious Cannabis individuals.

The Y chromosomes are highly-degenerate, with very few genes remaining, and show substantial rearrangements, while the X also shows faster rates of molecular evolution. The Cannabaceae sex chromosomes contain critical genes for flower development and the production of key compounds like bitter acids and cannabinoids, which are important traits for the plants. The sex chromosomes thus have played a vital role in the domestication and breeding of these species, and more generally, the Cannabaceae family.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Clustering and topic modeling of scATAC data identified discrete cell-types and continuous cell states, which helped reveal disease-relevant cellular contexts, and allowed mapping of genetic effects on chromatin accessibility across these contexts.

Notably, caQTLs colocalized with [~]50% more GWAS loci compared to eQTLs, helping to nominate putative causal genes for many unexplained loci. However, most GWAS-caQTL colocalizations had no detectable downstream regulatory effects on gene expression levels in the same cell type.

TFs often have drastically different regulatory behaviors depending on promoter context and interacting cofactors. However, the detailed mechanisms by which each TF affects transcription and produce promoter-dependent regulation is unclear. Here, we discover that a simple model explains the regulatory effects of E. coli TFs in a range of contexts. Specifically, we measure the relationship between basal promoter activity and its regulation by diverse TFs and find that the contextual changes in TF function are determined entirely by the basal strength of the regulated promoter: TFs exert lower fold-change on stronger promoters under a precise inverse scaling. Remarkably, this scaling relationship holds for both activators and repressors, indicating a universal mechanism of gene regulation. Our data, which spans between 100-fold activation to 1000-fold repression, is consistent with a model of regulation driven by stabilization of RNAP at the promoter for every TF. Crucially, this indicates that TFs naturally act to maintain homeostatic expression levels across genetic or environmental perturbations, ensuring robust expression of regulated genes.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

In Australia, they are considered exotic biosecurity threats, and an incursion of these viruses would require rapid and strict control efforts. However, current surveillance methods for these viruses are limited. We examined whether RMV and related tobamoviruses could be detected by deep sequencing of gut metatranscriptomes of vertebrate animals and ticks. Using this method, we discovered that RMV, as well as a novel relative of RMV, and two highly diverse novel tobamoviruses are present in Australia. RMV was detected in multiple sites in both the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and Tasmania, two regions separated by approximately 700km of land and 200km of water. The novel relative of RMV was detected in the ACT and New South Wales (NSW), while the highly divergent novel tobamoviruses were each detected in a single state, NSW and Queensland (QLD). In addition, Tobacco mild green mosaic virus, which is already known to be present in Australia, was detected in QLD using this method. This work highlights the potential utility of metatranscriptomic sequencing of wild animal gut for the surveillance of biosecurity threats to native and agricultural plant species.

ImportancePlant viruses can have devastating impacts on global horticulture. Tobamoviruses (family Virgaviridae, genus Tobamovirus) are among the most damaging seed-borne viruses in horticultural crops, and Australia is free of many of the tobamoviruses that cause major crop losses in other countries. These viruses are extremely difficult to eradicate. Consequently, early detection of incursions is key to the control of these viruses in Australia, alongside rapid deployment of eradication and management plans. Current biosecurity surveillance methods in Australia rely on visual inspection, immunological assays, and molecular methods such as screening of imported seed lots. This study introduces a complementary approach that utilises unbiased metatranscriptomic sequencing of animal gut material to detect cryptic plant viruses circulating in nature. Using this approach, we detected five different tobamovirus circulating in Australia, including a virus thought to be exotic and three novel viruses. This unique approach highlights alternative options for surveillance/detection of exotic crop viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

We demonstrate that this ribozyme be readily redesigned to alter tRNA specificity. This ribozyme is compatible with an in vitro translation system and could be used to recode a protein sequence to site-specifically incomporate a non-canonical amino acid.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

ASIC1a is the most abundant subunit in the central nervous system and forms homomeric channels permeable to Na+ and Ca2+, making it a compelling therapeutic target for acidotic pathologies including stroke and traumatic brain injury. However, a complete conformational library of human ASIC1a in its various functional states has yet to be described. Using cryo-EM, we obtained hASIC1a structures across a pH range between 8.5 and 5.7, as well as in the presence of a toxin agonist and a gating-modulating mutation. We identify six major conformations that establish linear transmembrane helices to be associated with an open state, delineate mechanistic differences between proton and toxin activation, and demonstrate that desensitization leads to unexpected conformational diversity in the transmembrane domain. Together, they provide a three-dimensional rationalization of decades of structure-function studies on ASIC.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Its application has, however, been hindered by limited chemical shift dispersions and an incomprehensive relationship between chemical shifts and protein structure. We exploit the sensitivity of 19F chemical shifts to ring currents by designing labels with direct contact to a native or engineered aromatic ring. Fifty protein variants predicted by AlphaFold and molecular dynamics simulations show 80-90% success rates and direct correlations of their experimental chemical shifts with the magnitude of the engineered ring current. Our method consequently improves the chemical shift dispersion and through simple 1D experiments enables structural analyses of alternative conformational states, including ribosome-bound folding intermediates, and in-cell measurements of thermodynamics and protein-protein interactions. Our strategy thus provides a simple and sensitive tool to extract residue contact restraints from chemical shifts for previously intractable systems.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Yet laboratory tests of decision making often investigate how animals optimize their behavior to achieve a single, well-defined goal, which is often a nutritive reward. Thus, how animals solve multi-objective optimization problems is not well understood. Here, we devised an ethologically-inspired decision making task to examine how rats balance the pursuit of food and non-food reinforcement. Rats performed a free-choice patch-foraging task, in which they could earn food in one location (food patch) or interact with a rodent play structure in a different location (toy patch). The cost of switching between patches was manipulated by requiring rats to endure a long or short ""travel time"" penalty during which they were not able to access either patch. Rats devoted a considerable amount of their limited foraging time to patches of both types, showing a small but significant preference for food patches. In accordance with theoretical models of foraging, when the cost of switching patches was high rats chose longer stay durations in both types of patches, suggesting that similar rational principles guided their pursuit of food and non-food rewards. Examining the within-session dynamics of time allocation revealed that rats showed an early preference for spending time in toy patches that reversed over the course of the session. These results validate a naturalistic approach to testing decision making in rats over a range of food and non-food goods.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

The functional oligomeric conformation of full-length GR (FL-GR), which is key for its biological activity, remains disputed. Here we present a new crystal structure of agonist-bound GR ligand-binding domain (GR-LBD) comprising eight copies of a non-canonical dimer. The biological relevance of this dimer for receptor multimerization in living cells has been verified by studying single- and double-point mutants of FL-GR in fluorescence microscopy (Number & Brightness) and transcriptomic analysis. Self-association of this GR-LBD basic dimer in two mutually exclusive assemblies reveals clues for FL-GR multimerization and activity in cells. We propose a model for the structure of multidomain GR based on our new data and suggest a detailed oligomerization pathway. This model reconciles all currently available structural and functional information and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the rare glucocorticoid resistance disorder (Chrousos syndrome).","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

These prototypic heterochromatin compartments are marked by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). However, its contributions to chromocenter structure and function remain debated. We investigated the role of HP1 by recruiting the activators VP16, p65, and VPR to mouse fibroblast chromocenters and analyzed its silencing activity with a transcription reporter. Upon chromocenter decondensation and transcription activation, interactions of HP1 with chromatin and H3K9 trimethylation remained stable, suggesting stoichiometric binding rather than higher-order assembly. HP1-mediated repression required promoter-proximal binding and effectively suppressed VP16-triggered activation but not the stronger activation by VPR. These observations are explained by a 1D lattice binding model, which conceptualizes chromocenters as arrays of repeat units that can independently switch between silenced and activated states. Our findings provide a quantitative framework that explains how chromocenter organization responds to transcriptional activation while maintaining local heterochromatin features.

However, their variability complicates reference-based analysis, especially when these chromosomes are missing in the reference genome. Pangenome variation graphs offer a reference-free alternative for studying these chromosomes. Here, we constructed a pangenome variation graph for 73 diverse Fusarium oxysporum genomes, a major fungal plant pathogen with a compartmentalized genome that includes conserved core as well as variable accessory chromosomes. To obtain insights into accessory chromosome dynamics, we first constructed a chromosome similarity network using all-vs-all similarity mapping. We identified eleven core chromosomes conserved across all strains and a substantial number of highly variable accessory chromosomes. Some of these accessory chromosomes are host-specific and likely play a role in determining host range. Using a k-mer based approach we further identified the presence of these accessory chromosomes in all available (581) F. oxysporum assemblies and corroborated the occurrence of host specific accessory chromosomes. To further analyze the evolution of chromosomes in F. oxysporum, we constructed a pangenome variation graph per group of homologous chromosomes. This reveals that accessory chromosomes are composed of different stretches of accessory regions, and possibly rearrangements between accessory regions gave rise to these mosaic accessory chromosomes. Furthermore, we show that accessory chromosomes are likely horizontally transferred in natural populations. Our findings demonstrate that a pangenome variation graph is a powerful approach to elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of accessory chromosomes in F. oxysporum, which is not only a useful resource for Fusarium but provides a framework for similar analyses in other species encoding accessory chromosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969

Even cancers with the same driver mutation show significant transcriptional heterogeneity and varied responses to therapy. However, the mechanisms underpinning this heterogeneity remain under-explored. Here, we find that novel enhancer usage is a common feature in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In particular, KMT2A::AFF1 ALL, an aggressive leukemia with a poor prognosis and a low mutational burden, exhibits substantial transcriptional heterogeneity between individuals. Using single cell multiome analysis and extensive chromatin profiling, we reveal that much transcriptional heterogeneity in KMT2A::AFF1 ALL is driven by novel enhancer usage. Using high resolution Micro-Capture-C in primary patient samples, we also identify patient-specific enhancer activity at key oncogenes such as MEIS1 and RUNX2, driving high levels of expression of both oncogenes in a patient-specific manner. Overall, our data show that enhancer heterogeneity is highly prevalent in KMT2A::AFF1 ALL and may also be a mechanism that drives transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer more generally.

Despite their importance, the high-resolution structure of PMEL amyloids has remained elusive. Here, we determined near-atomic resolution structures of wild-type PMEL amyloids using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing two distinct polymorphic forms with unique structural features. We further examined the pathogenic G175S mutation linked to pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS). Structural analysis showed that the G175S mutation introduces an additional hydrogen bond, stabilizing a novel fibril conformation. In vitro assays demonstrated a fourfold increase in polymerization efficiency for the G175S mutant compared to the wild-type. This enhanced polymerization correlated with a [~]70% increase in secreted amyloids in G175S-expressing cells without detectable changes in melanosome morphology or number. These findings suggest that the G175S mutation promotes amyloidogenesis within melanosomes, increasing amyloid load and contributing to PDS pathophysiology. This study provides insights into the molecular basis of PMEL amyloid formation in both physiological and pathological contexts, offering new perspectives on their structural diversity and dysregulation in pigmentation disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1734300521969
