We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885494

It has been hypothesized that autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of Long COVID and other syndromes, such as fibromyalgia and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by passively transferring total IgG from Long COVID patients to mice. Using Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and type-I interferon expression, we stratified patients into three Long COVID subgroups, each with unique plasma proteome signatures. Remarkably, IgG transfer from the two subgroups, which are characterized by higher plasma levels of neuronal proteins and leukocyte activation markers, induced pronounced and persistent sensory hypersensitivity with distinct kinetics. Conversely, IgG transfer from the third subgroup, which are characterized by enriched skeletal and cardiac muscle proteome profiles, reduced locomotor activity in mice without affecting their motor coordination. These findings demonstrate that transfer of IgG from Long COVID patients to mice replicates disease symptoms, underscoring IgG's causative role in Long COVID pathogenesis. This work proposes a murine model that mirrors Long COVID's pathophysiological mechanisms, which may be used as a tool for screening and developing targeted therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

In October 2023, following outbreaks in sea lions in Argentina, we recorded unprecedented mass mortality (~17,000 individuals) in southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) at Peninsula Valdes. Seal pups were disproportionately affected. Adult seals departed early, disrupting social and breeding structure. Frequent interactions with sea lions and scavenging by seagulls were observed. Deaths of terns concurred with seals but peaked weeks later. HPAI H5N1 was confirmed in seals and terns. Moreover, genomic characterization showed viruses from pinnipeds and terns in Argentina form a distinct clade with marine mammal viruses from Peru, Chile and Brazil. These mammal-clade viruses share an identical set of mammalian adaptation mutations which are notably also found in the terns. Our combined ecological and phylogenetic data support mammal-to-mammal transmission and occasional mammal-to-bird spillover. To our knowledge, this is the first multinational transmission of H5N1 viruses in mammals ever observed globally. The implication that H5N1 viruses are becoming more evolutionary flexible and adapting to mammals in new ways could have global consequences for wildlife, humans, and/or livestock.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) is currently the most widely accepted MS method in the clinic, due to its reliability and analytical performance. However, due to limited throughput and the difficulty in setting up and analyzing large scale assays, SRM and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) are typically used only for very refined as-says of on the order of 100 targets or less. Here we introduce a new MS platform with a quadrupole mass filter, collision cell, linear ion trap architecture that has increased acquisition rates compared to the analogous hardware found in the OrbitrapTM TribridTM series instruments. The platform can target more analytes than existing SRM and PRM instruments, in the range of 5000 to 8000 peptides per hour. This capability for high multiplexing is enabled by acquisition rates of 70-100 Hz for peptide applications, and the incorporation of real time chromatogram alignment that adjusts for retention time drift and enables narrow time scheduled acquisition windows. Finally, we describe a Skyline external software tool that implements the building of targeted methods based on data independent acquisition chromatogram libraries or unscheduled analysis of heavy labeled standards. We show that the platform delivers ~10x lower LOQs than traditional SRM analysis for a highly multiplex assay and also demonstrate how analytical figures of merit change while varying method duration with a constant number of analytes, or by keeping a constant time duration while varying the number of analytes.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

Extensive genome sequencing efforts are currently in progress across a broad spectrum of life forms, holding the potential to unravel the intricate branching patterns within the tree of life. However, estimating species trees starting from raw genome sequences is quite challenging, and the current cutting-edge methodologies require a series of error-prone steps that are neither entirely automated nor standardized. In this paper, we present ROADIES, a novel pipeline for species tree inference from raw genome assemblies that is fully automated, easy to use, scalable, free from reference bias, and provides flexibility to adjust the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. The ROADIES pipeline eliminates the need to align whole genomes, choose a single reference species, or pre-select loci such as functional genes found using cumbersome annotation steps. Moreover, it leverages recent advances in phylogenetic inference to allow multi-copy genes, eliminating the need to detect orthology. Using the genomic datasets released from large-scale sequencing consortia across three diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, and birds), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality with the state-of-the-art approaches but in a fraction of the time. By incorporating optimal approaches and automating all steps from assembled genomes to species and gene trees, ROADIES is poised to improve the accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility of phylogenomic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

While triple quadrupoles offer fast and sensitive nominal resolution measurements, these instruments are effectively limited to targeted proteomics. Linear ion traps (LITs) offer a versatile, cost-effective alternative capable of both targeted and global proteomics. We demonstrate a workflow using a newly released, hybrid quadrupole-LIT instrument for developing targeted proteomics assays from global data-independent acquisition (DIA) measurements without needing high-mass accuracy. Gas-phase fraction-based DIA enables rapid target library generation in the same background chemical matrix as each quantitative injection. Using a new software tool embedded within EncyclopeDIA for scheduling parallel reaction monitoring assays, we show consistent quantification across three orders of magnitude of input material. Using this approach, we demonstrate measuring peptide quantitative linearity down to 25x dilution in a background of only a 1 ng proteome without requiring stable isotope labeled standards. At 1 ng total protein on column, we found clear consistency between immune cell populations measured using flow cytometry and immune markers measured using LIT-based proteomics. We believe hybrid quadrupole-LIT instruments represent an economic solution to democratizing mass spectrometry in a wide variety of laboratory settings.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

The huge number of scientific articles using the term arousal (~50.000) highlights the importance of the concept, but also explains why such a vast literature had never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

These fluorescent proteins (FPs) have enabled the real-time observation of protein localization and dynamics within live cells. Applications of FP vary from monitoring gene/protein expression patterns, visualizing protein-protein interactions, measuring protein stability, assessing protein mobility and creating biosensors. The utility of FPs also extends to biochemical approaches through immunoblotting and proteomic analyses, aided by anti-FP antibodies and nanobodies. FPs are notoriously robust proteins with a tightly folded domain that confers a strong stability and a relative resistance to degradation and denaturation. In this study, we report that various green and red FPs can be maintained in a native, fluorescent form during the entire process of protein sample extraction, incubation with sample buffer, loading and migration on SDS-PAGE with only minor adaptations of traditional protocols. This protocol results in the ability to detect and quantify in-gel fluorescence (IGF) of endogenously-expressed proteins tagged with FPs directly after migration, using standard fluorescence-imaging devices. This approach eliminates the need for antibodies and chemiluminescent reagents, as well as the time-consuming steps inherent to immunoblotting such as transfer onto a membrane and antibody incubations. Overall, IGF detection provides clearer data with less background interference, a sensitivity comparable or better to antibody-based detection, a better quantification and a broader dynamic range. After fluorescence imaging, gels can still be used for other applications such as total protein staining or immunoblotting if needed. It also expands possibilities by allowing the detection of FPs for which antibodies are not available. Our study explores the feasibility, limitations, and applications of IGF for detecting endogenously expressed proteins in cell extracts, providing insights into sample preparation, imaging conditions, and sensitivity optimizations, and potential applications such as co-immunoprecipitation experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

ProCapNet learns sequence motifs with distinct effects on initiation rates and TSS positioning and uncovers context-specific cryptic initiator elements intertwined within other TF motifs. ProCapNet annotates predictive motifs in nearly all actively transcribed regulatory elements across multiple cell-lines, revealing a shared cis-regulatory logic across promoters and enhancers mediated by a highly epistatic sequence syntax of cooperative and competitive motif interactions.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Balance of the activity in these canonical direct-indirect pathways is considered a core requirement for normal movement control, and their imbalance is a major etiologic factor in movement disorders including Parkinsons disease. We present evidence for a conceptually equivalent parallel system of direct-D1 and indirect-D2 pathways that arise from striatal projection neurons (SPNs) of the striosome compartment rather than from the matrix. These striosomal direct (S-D1) and indirect (S-D2) pathways, as a pair, target dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra (SNpc) instead of the motor output nuclei of the basal ganglia. The novel anatomically and functionally distinct indirect-D2 striosomal pathway targets dopaminergic SNpc cells indirectly via a core region of the external pallidum (GPe). We demonstrate that these S-D1 and S-D2 pathways oppositely modulate striatal dopamine release in freely behaving mice under open-field conditions and oppositely modulate locomotor and other movements. These S-D1 and S-D2 pathways further exhibit different, time-dependent responses during performance of a probabilistic decision-making maze task and respond differently to rewarding and aversive stimuli. These contrasts depend on mediolateral and anteroposterior striatal locations of the SPNs as are the classic direct and indirect pathways. The effects of S-D1 and S-D2 stimulation on striatal dopamine release and voluntary locomotion are nearly opposite. The parallelism of the direct-indirect circuit design motifs of the striosomal S-D and S-D2 circuits and canonical matrix M-D1 and M-D2, and their contrasting behavioral effects, call for a major reformulation of the classic direct-indirect pathway model of basal ganglia function. Given that some striosomes receive limbic and association cortical inputs, the S-D1 and S-D2 circuits likely influence motivation for action and behavioral learning, complementing and possibly reorienting the motoric activities of the canonical matrix pathways. At a fundamental level, these findings suggest a unifying framework for aligning two sets of circuits that share the organizational motif of opponent D1 and D2 regulation, but that have different outputs and can even have opposite polarities in their targets and effects, albeit conditioned by striatal topography. Our findings further delineate a potentially therapeutically important set of pathways influencing dopamine, including a D2 receptor-linked S-D2 pathway likely unknowingly targeted by administration of many therapeutic drugs including those for Parkinsons disease. The novel parallel pathway model that we propose here could help to account for the normally integrated modulatory influence of the basal ganglia on motivation for actions as well as the actions themselves.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717365885494

The molecular mechanisms that drive essential developmental patterning events in the mammalian embryo remain poorly understood. To generate a conceptual framework for gene regulatory processes during germ layer specification, we analyzed transcription factor (TF) expression kinetics around gastrulation and during in vitro differentiation. This approach identified Otx2 as a candidate regulator of definitive endoderm (DE), the precursor of all gut-derived tissues. Analysis of multipurpose degron alleles in gastruloid and directed differentiation models revealed that loss of OTX2 before or after DE specification alters the expression of core components and targets of specific cellular signaling pathways, perturbs adhesion and migration programs as well as de-represses regulators of other lineages, resulting in impaired foregut specification. Key targets of OTX2 are conserved in human DE. Mechanistically, OTX2 is required to establish chromatin accessibility at candidate enhancers, which regulate genes critical to establishing an anterior cell identity in the developing gut. Our results provide a working model for the progressive establishment of spatiotemporal cell identity by developmental TFs across germ layers and species, which may facilitate the generation of gut cell types for regenerative medicine applications.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

We show that in OptoEGFR-expressing tissues, light can drive millimeter-scale cell rearrangements to densify interior regions or produce rapid outgrowth at tissue edges. Light-controlled tissue movements are driven primarily by PI 3-kinase signaling, rather than diffusible signals, tissue contractility, or ERK kinase signaling as seen in other RTK-driven migration contexts. Our study suggests that synthetic, light-controlled RTKs could serve as a powerful platform for controlling cell positions and densities for diverse applications including wound healing and tissue morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Within germ granules, mRNAs form multi-transcript clusters marked by increased mRNA concentration, creating an elevated potential for intermolecular base pairing. However, the type and abundance of intermolecular base pairing in mRNA clusters is poorly characterized. Using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy, chemical probing for base accessibility, phase separation assays, and simulations, we demonstrated that mRNAs remain well-folded upon localization to germ granules. While most base pairing is intramolecular, mRNAs still display the ability for intermolecular base pairing, facilitating clustering without high sequence complementarity or significant melting of secondary structure. This base pairing among mRNAs is driven by scattered and discontinuous stretches of bases appearing on the surface of folded RNAs, providing multivalency to clustering but exhibits low probability for sustained interactions. Notably, engineered germ granule mRNAs with exposed GC-rich complementary sequences (CSs) presented within stable stem loops induce sustained base pairing in vitro and enhanced intermolecular interactions in vivo. However, the presence of these stem loops alone disrupts fly development, and the addition of GC-rich CSs exacerbates this phenotype. Although germ granule mRNAs contain numerous GC-rich CSs capable of stable intermolecular base pairing, they are primarily embedded by RNA folding. This study emphasizes the role of RNA folding in controlling the type and abundance of intermolecular base pairing, thereby preserving the functional integrity of mRNAs within the germ granules.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

To develop a targeted bottom-up proteomics assay, peptides must be evaluated as proxies for the measurement of a protein or proteoform in a biological matrix. Candidate peptide selection typically relies on predetermined biochemical properties, data from semi-stochastic sampling, or by empirical measurements. These strategies require extensive testing and method refinement due to the difficulties associated with prediction of peptide response in the biological matrix of interest. Gas-phase fractionated (GPF) narrow window data-independent acquisition (DIA) aids in the development of reproducible selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays by providing matrix-specific information on peptide detectability and quantification by mass spectrometry.

Here we assessed whether rhesus macaques could model human context-driven object recognition by quantifying visual object identification abilities across variations in the amount, quality, and congruency of contextual cues. Behavioral metrics revealed strikingly similar context-dependent patterns between humans and monkeys. However, neural responses in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys that were never explicitly trained to discriminate objects in context, as well as current artificial neural network models, could only partially explain this cross-species correspondence.

A major unanswered question is whether the metabolism of modern eukaryotes bears any vestige of this ancestral interaction. To investigate this question in detail, we systematically analyze the evolutionary origins of the eukaryotic gene repertoires mediating central carbon metabolism. Our phylogenetic and sequence analyses reveal that this gene repertoire is chimeric, with ancestral contributions from Asgardarchaeota and Alphaproteobacteria operating predominantly in glycolysis and TCA, respectively. Furthermore, our analyses reveal diverse additional contributions from other prokaryotic sources as well as the extent to which this ancestral metabolic interplay has been remodeled via gene loss, transfer, and subcellular retargeting in the >2Ga since the origin of eukaryotic cells. Together, our work demonstrates that in contrast to previous assumptions, the eukaryotic metabolism preserves information about the nature of the original asgardarchaeal-alphaproteobacterial interactions, and supports syntrophy scenarios on the origin of the eukaryotic cell.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Exacerbating the public health threat posed by K. pneumoniae, some strains also harbor additional hypervirulence determinants typically acquired via mobile genetic elements such as the well-characterised large virulence plasmid KpVP-1. The rmpADC locus is considered a key virulence feature of K. pneumoniae and is associated with upregulated capsule expression and the hypermucoid phenotype, which can enhance virulence by contributing to serum resistance. Typically such strains have been susceptible to all antimicrobials besides ampicillin, however the recent emergence of AMR hypermucoid strains is concerning. Methods: Here, we investigate the genetic diversity, evolution, mobilisation and prevalence of rmpADC, in a dataset of 14000 genomes from isolates of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, and describe the RmST virulence typing scheme for tracking rmpADC variants for the purposes of genomic surveillance. Additionally, we examine the functionality of representatives for variants of rmpADC introduced into a mutant strain lacking its native rmpADC locus, Results: The rmpADC locus was detected in 7% of the dataset, mostly from genomes of K. pneumoniae and a very small number of K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae. Sequence variants of rmpADC grouped into five distinct lineages (rmp1, rmp2, rmp2A, rmp3 and rmp4) that corresponded to unique mobile elements, and were differentially distributed across different populations (i.e. clonal groups) of K. pneumoniae. All variants were demonstrated to produce enhanced capsule production and hypermucoviscosity. Conclusion: These results provide an overview of the diversity and evolution of a prominent K. pneumoniae virulence factor and support the idea that screening for rmpADC in K. pneumoniae isolates and genomes is valuable to monitor the emergence and spread of hypermucoid K. pneumoniae, including AMR strains.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

We identify the location and size of introgressed Neandertal ancestry segments in more than 300 genomes spanning the last 50,000 years. We study how Neandertal ancestry is shared among individuals to infer the time and duration of the Neandertal gene flow. We find the correlation of Neandertal segment locations across individuals and their divergence to sequenced Neandertals, both support a model of single major Neandertal gene flow. Our catalog of introgressed segments through time confirms that most natural selection-positive and negative-on Neandertal ancestry variants occurred immediately after the gene flow, and provides new insights into how the contact with Neandertals shaped human origins and adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Methods: Here we examine post-mortem tissue from six brain regions associated with cognitive and behavioural symptoms in a cohort of 30 people with sporadic ALS (sALS), a proportion of which underwent standardized neuropsychological behavioural assessment as part of the Edinburgh Cognitive ALS Screen (ECAS). Results: Overall, the behavioural screen performed as part of the ECAS predicted accumulation of pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) with 100% specificity and 86% sensitivity in behaviour-associated brain regions. Notably, of these regions, pathology in the amygdala was the most predictive correlate of behavioural dysfunction in sALS. In the amygdala of sALS patients, we show variation in morphology, cell type predominance, and severity of pTDP-43 pathology. Further, we demonstrate that the presence and severity of intra-neuronal pTDP-43 pathology, but not astroglial pathology, or phosphorylated Tau pathology, is associated with behavioural dysfunction. Cases were also evaluated using a TDP-43 aptamer (TDP-43APT), which revealed that pathology was not only associated with behavioural symptoms, but also with ferritin levels, a measure of brain iron. Conclusions: Intra-neuronal pTDP-43 and cytoplasmic TDP-43APT pathology in the amygdala is associated with behavioural symptoms in sALS. TDP-43APT staining intensity is also associated with increased ferritin, regardless of behavioural phenotype, suggesting that ferritin increases may occur upstream of clinical manifestation, in line with early TDP-43APT pathology, representing a potential region-specific imaging biomarker of early disease in ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

What is missing in the literature, however, is a systematic investigation of the relevance of specific thalamic nuclei in pharmacologically and pathologically altered states of consciousness in humans. Using functional neuroimaging in both healthy anaesthetised volunteers and patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), we sought to identify which specific thalamic subregions in both cohorts may be differentially significant for loss of consciousness. Our findings revealed that the pulvinar (Pu) and ventral-latero-ventral (VLV) nuclei, in anaesthesia, and the VLV, in DOC, had distinct functional connectivity patterns related to the default mode and somatomotor networks. Remarkably, among all nuclei, the Pu was found to have the strongest functional connectivity change with anaesthetic-induced loss of consciousness, while in DOC patients, we found the VLV revealed the strongest connectivity change in comparison with healthy controls. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this neural connectivity biomarker in patients also mirrors the changes observed at the behavioural level, which could have clinical implications for targeted deep brain stimulation in therapy for DOC.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Diverse microorganisms have nevertheless been detected within caves, though it remains unclear what strategies enable them to meet their energy and carbon needs. Here we determined the processes and mediators of primary production in aerated limestone and basalt caves through paired metagenomic and biogeochemical profiling. Based on 1458 metagenome-assembled genomes, over half of microbial cells in caves encode enzymes to use atmospheric trace gases as energy and carbon sources. The most abundant microbes in these systems are chemosynthetic primary producers, notably the novel gammaproteobacterial methanotrophic order Ca. Methylocavales and two uncultivated actinobacterial genera predicted to grow on atmospheric hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. In situ and ex situ biogeochemical and isotopic measurements consistently confirmed that these gases are rapidly consumed at rates sufficient to meet community-wide energy needs and drive continual primary production. Conventional chemolithoautotrophs, which use trace lithic compounds such as ammonium and sulfide, are also enriched and active alongside these trace gas scavengers. These results indicate that caves are unique in both their microbial composition and the biogeochemical processes that sustain them. Based on these findings, we propose caves are the first known ecosystems where atmospheric trace gases primarily sustain growth rather than survival and define this process as ""aerotrophy"". Cave aerotrophy may be a hidden process supporting global biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Using state-of-the-art SCP workflow, we demonstrated that two SILAC labels are detectable from ~4000 proteins in single HeLa cells recapitulating known biology. We investigated drug effects on global and specific protein turnover in single cells and performed a large-scale time-series SC-pSILAC analysis of undirected differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) encompassing six sampling times over two months and analyzed >1000 cells. Abundance measurements highlighted cell-specific markers of stem cells and various organ-specific cell types. Protein turnover dynamics highlighted differentiation-specific co-regulation of core members of protein complexes with core histone turnover discriminating dividing and non-dividing cells with potential in stem cell and cancer research. Our study represents the most comprehensive SCP analysis to date, offering new insights into cellular diversity and pioneering functional measurements beyond protein abundance.

To date, most studies have used affinity proteomics platforms, which have limited discovery to protein panels covered by the available affinity binders. Furthermore, it is not clear to which extent protein epitope changing variants interfere with the detection of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). Mass spectrometry-based (MS) proteomics can overcome some of these limitations. Here we report a GWAS using the MS-based Seer Proteograph platform with blood samples from a discovery cohort of 1,260 American participants and a replication in 325 individuals from Asia, with diverse ethnic backgrounds. We analysed 1,980 proteins quantified in at least 80% of the samples, out of 5,753 proteins quantified across the discovery cohort. We identified 252 and replicated 90 pQTLs, where 30 of the replicated pQTLs have not been reported before. We further investigated 200 of the strongest associated cis-pQTLs previously identified using the SOMAscan and the Olink platforms and found that up to one third of the affinity proteomics pQTLs may be affected by epitope effects, while another third were confirmed by MS proteomics to be consistent with the hypothesis that genetic variants induce changes in protein expression. The present study demonstrates the complementarity of the different proteomics approaches and reports pQTLs not accessible to affinity proteomics, suggesting that many more pQTLs remain to be discovered using MS-based platforms.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Unknown species with similarity to known genomes cause database bias in reference-based metagenomics. To improve surveillance, we designed this study to recover sewage genomes and develop a quantification and correlation workflow for these genomes and AMR over time. We used longitudinal sewage sampling in seven treatment plants from five major European cities to explore the utility of catch-all sequencing of these population-level samples. Using metagenomic assembly methods, we recovered 2,332 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from prokaryotic species, 1,334 of which were previously undescribed. These genomes account for ~69% of sequenced DNA and provide insight into sewage microbial dynamics. Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Copenhagen (Denmark) showed strong seasonal microbial community shifts, while Bologna, Rome, (Italy) and Budapest (Hungary) had occasional blooms of Pseudomonas-dominated communities, accounting for up to ~95% of sample DNA. Seasonal shifts and blooms present challenges for effective sewage surveillance. We find that bacteria of known shared origin, like human gut microbiota, form communities, suggesting the potential for source-attributing novel species and their ARGs through network community analysis. This could significantly improve AMR tracking in urban environments.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

In addition to calcification and flagella, transcriptomes and proteomes of haploid and diploid cells modulate their differentiation in photosynthesis, sulfatases, DMSP degradation, DNA replication, and endomembrane system and transport. Haploid-diploid differential gene expression can be partially attributable to allelic imbalance (allele-specific expression) in diploid cells. Gene transcript abundance is positively associated with both CG and CHG gene-body DNA methylation, which can be inheritable, allele-specific, and differentiated between life-cycle phases. This multiomic study unravels the regulatory basis of unicellular algal life-cycle differentiation and provides valuable resources for investigating the ecologically important coccolithophore algae.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Here, we developed a naturalistic foraging task in which rats decided when and how fast to run across a motorized treadmill to collect rewards. Model-based analyses explained why decision and movement speeds were coupled or decoupled as rats adapted to changes in reward value or motor cost, respectively. Moreover, lesions of the dorsal striatum increased the animals' sensitivity to motor cost, limiting their running speed in the most effortful conditions while sparing reward-related behavioral modulations.

In complexes with PIWI proteins, they mediate the silencing of transposons and other genes at both transcriptional and post- transcriptional levels. While numerous additional proteins are known to be essential for piRNA biogenesis and function in Drosophila and other animals, their molecular and mechanistic functions have remained largely unknown. To improve our molecular understanding of the Drosophila piRNA pathway, we used a cell culture-based protein- protein interaction assay, called ReLo, and performed a systematic pairwise interaction screen involving 22 factors operating in the cytoplasm, including PIWI proteins, Tudor domain-containing proteins (TDRDs), RNA helicases, and mitochondrial surface proteins. We detected all previously reported interactions for which crystal structures have been determined, some of which are dependent on symmetric arginine dimethylation (sDMA), and several interactions previously identified by co- immunoprecipitation experiments. In addition, we identified previously unknown interactions. Through additional ReLo interaction testing and structural modeling using AlphaFold-Multimer, we have characterized six protein complexes at the molecular and structural levels, namely the Vreteno-BoYb, Vreteno-SoYb, Tejas-Spindle E, Tejas- Maelstrom, Tejas-Krimper complexes, as well as the complex composed of Armi and the Gasz-Daed heterodimer.

The most common genetic causes are mutations in the CLN3 gene encoding a lysosomal protein. There are currently no therapies targeting the progression of the disease, mostly due to the lack of knowledge about the disease mechanisms. To gain insight into the impact of CLN3 loss on cellular signaling and organelle function, we generated CLN3 knock-out cells in a human cell line (CLN3-KO), and performed RNA sequencing to obtain the cellular transcriptome. Following a multi-dimensional transcriptome analysis, we identified the transcriptional regulator YAP1 as a major driver of the transcriptional changes observed in CLN3-KO cells. We further observed that YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling is hyperactive as a consequence of CLN3 functional loss in retinal pigment epithelia cells, and in the hippocampus and thalamus of CLN3ex{Delta}7/8 mice, an established model of Batten disease. Loss of CLN3 activates YAP1 by a cascade of events that starts with the inability of releasing glycerophosphodiesthers from CLN3-KO lysosomes, which leads to perturbations in the lipid content of the nuclear envelope and nuclear dysmorphism. This results in increased number of DNA lesions, activating the kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates YAP1, stimulating its pro-apoptotic signaling. Altogether, our results highlight a novel organelle crosstalk paradigm in which lysosomal metabolites regulate nuclear envelope content, nuclear shape and DNA homeostasis. This novel molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CLN3 in mammalian cells and tissues may open new c-Abl-centric therapeutic strategies to target Batten disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Thus, we aimed to study differences in the blood microbiome of HCV-infected patients with and without hepatic decompensation.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study in patients with advanced HCV-related cirrhosis with or without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (n=88). MiSeq Illumina technology for bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing was used. Non-targeted metabolomics was performed by GC-MS and LC-MS ESI+ and ESI-.

ResultsPatients with decompensated cirrhosis had lower levels of richness (Chao1), and alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes) at phylum level, than patients without decompensation. Likewise, we observed significant differences in beta diversity between groups at phylum, class and order levels, being lower in decompensated cirrhotic patients. Higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria (Fold Change (FC)=1.54, p=0.012), Alphaproteobacteria (FC=1.57, p=0.016) and Sphingomonadales (FC=1.61, p=0.050) were significantly associated with hepatic decompensation. The phylum Proteobacteria was positively correlated with ethanolamine and oleic acid (p=0.005 and p=0.004, respectively) and negatively with p-cresol (p=0.006). In addition, the order Sphingomonadales was also negatively correlated with p-cresol (p=0.001).

ConclusionsBlood microbial diversity was significantly decreased in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, who presented an enrichment of Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Sphingomonadales, compared to patients with compensated cirrhosis.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885494

Both the overall rate and the spatial distribution of crossovers vary within and between species. Adjacent crossovers on the same chromosome tend to be spaced more evenly than expected at random, a phenomenon known as crossover interference. Although interference has been observed in many taxa, the factors that influence the strength of interference are not well understood. We used house mice (Mus musculus), a well-established model system for understanding recombination, to study the effects of genetics and age on recombination rate and interference in the male germline. We analyzed crossover positions in 503 progeny from reciprocal F1 hybrids between inbred strains representing the three major subspecies of house mice. Consistent with previous studies, autosomal alleles from M. m. musculus tend to increase recombination rate, while inheriting a M. m. musculus X chromosome decreases recombination rate. Old males transmit an average of $0.6$ more crossovers per meiosis (5.0%) than young males, though the effect varies across genetic backgrounds. We show that the strength of crossover interference depends on genotype, providing a rare demonstration that interference evolves over short timescales. Differences between reciprocal F1s suggest that X-linked factors modulate the strength of interference. Our findings motivate additional comparisons of interference among recently diverged species and further examination of the role of paternal age in determining the number and positioning of crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

We found five Irx genes (Irx1, Irx2, Irx3, Irx5, and Irx6) to be confined mostly to ventral spinal domains, offering new molecular markers for specific groups of post-mitotic motor neurons (MNs). Further, we engineered Irx2, Irx5, and Irx6 mouse mutants and uncovered essential but distinct roles for Irx2 and Irx6 in MN development.

Although hierarchies are largely stable across time, animals may socially ascend or descend within hierarchies depending on environmental and social challenges. Here, we develop a novel paradigm to study social ascent and descent within male CD-1 mouse social hierarchies. We show that mice of all social ranks rapidly establish new stable social hierarchies when placed in novel social groups with animals of equivalent social status. Seventy minutes following social hierarchy formation, previously socially dominant animals exhibit higher increases in plasma corticosterone and vastly greater transcriptional changes in the medial amygdala (MeA), which is central to the regulation of social behavior, compared to previously subordinate animals. Specifically, social descent is associated with reductions in MeA expression of myelination and oligodendrocyte differentiation genes. Maintaining high social status is associated with high expression of genes related to cholinergic signaling in the MeA. Conversely, social ascent is related to relatively few unique rapid changes in the MeA. We also identify novel genes associated with social transition that show common changes in expression when animals undergo either social descent or social ascent compared to maintaining their status. Two genes, Myosin binding protein C1 (Mybpc1) and -Crystallin (Crym), associated with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and thyroid hormone pathways respectively, are highly upregulated in socially transitioning individuals. Further, increases in genes associated with synaptic plasticity, excitatory glutamatergic signaling and learning and memory pathways were observed in transitioning animals suggesting that adaptations in these processes may support rapid social status changes.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Specifically, it samples the smallest k-mer according to the order O from each window of w consecutive k-mers in S. Because consecutive windows can sample the same k-mer, the set of the sampled k-mers is typically much smaller than S. This makes the minimizer a versatile tool to reduce the memory footprint and processing time of several applications in bioinformatics, such as sequence comparison, assembly, compacted De Bruijn graph construction, and sequence indexing. More generally, we consider substring sampling algorithms that respect a window guarantee: at least one k-mer must be sampled from every window of w consecutive k-mers. As a sampled k-mer is uniquely identified by its absolute position in S, we can define the density of a sampling algorithm as the fraction of distinct sampled positions. Good methods have low density which, by respecting the window guarantee, is lower bounded by 1/w. It is however difficult to design a sequence-agnostic algorithm with provably optimal density. In practice, the order O is usually implemented using a pseudo-random hash function to obtain the so-called random minimizer. This scheme is simple to implement, very fast to compute even in streaming fashion, and easy to analyze. However, its density is almost a factor of 2 away from the lower bound for large windows. Prior work has thus focused on methods that achieve lower density than the random minimizer, both in theory and practice. Nonetheless, those methods remain difficult to analyze and intuitively understand, and are not always as versatile as random minimizers. Methods: In this work we introduce mod-sampling, a two-step sampling algorithm to obtain new minimizer schemes. Given a (small) parameter t, the mod-sampling algorithm finds the position p of the smallest t-mer in a window. It then samples the k-mer at position p mod w. The lr-minimizer uses t = k - w and the mod-minimizer uses t {equiv} k (mod w). Results: These new schemes have provably lower density than classic random minimizers and other schemes when k is large compared to w, while being as fast to compute. Importantly, the mod-minimizer achieves optimal density when k [-&gt;] {infty}. Although the mod-minimizer is not the first method to achieve optimal density for large k, its proof of optimality is simpler than previous work. We provide pseudocode for a number of other methods and compare to them. In practice, the mod-minimizer has considerably lower density than the random minimizer and other state-of-the-art methods, like closed syncmers and miniception, when k > w. We plugged the mod-minimizer into SSHash, a k-mer dictionary based on minimizers. For default parameters (w, k) = (11, 21), space usage decreases by 15% when indexing the whole human genome (GRCh38), while maintaining its fast query time.

Targeting of RISC to foreign RNA establishes amplification loops, wherein RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase 6 (RDR6) synthesizes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for secondary small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis, using cleavage fragments of RNA targeted by RISC programmed with a primary siRNA as template. Secondary siRNA production from endogenous RISC targets requires a particular primary small RNA size or target site multiplicity. siRNA amplification in yeast and nematodes requires terminal nucleotidyl transferases (TNTases), but their roles in plants are unclear. Here, we demonstrate two functions of TNTases in siRNA amplification in Arabidopsis thaliana. URT1 prevents initiation of microRNA-induced secondary siRNA formation through uridylation of 5'-cleavage fragments, sometimes redundantly with the exosome and the TNTase HESO1. Once initiated via RDR6 recruitment, HESO1 and other TNTases stimulate secondary siRNA formation by producing 2-nt 3'overhangs on RDR6-synthesized dsRNA to yield substrates for processing into siRNAs by DICER-LIKE4. These results define molecular mechanisms by which TNTases control siRNA amplification in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Here we use an unsupervised approach to analyze time associated DNA methylation from both in vivo and in vitro samples to measure an underlying signal that ties these phenomena together.

Previous work has shown that rapid depletion of the architectural protein CTCF in cell culture strongly alters chromatin organization but results in surprisingly limited gene expression changes. This discrepancy has also been observed when other architectural proteins are depleted, and one possible explanation is that full transcriptional changes are masked by cellular heterogeneity. We tested this idea by performing multi-omics analyses with sorted post-mitotic mouse rods, which undergo synchronized development, and identified CTCF-dependent regulation of global chromatin accessibility and gene expression. Depletion of CTCF leads to dysregulation of ~20% of the entire transcriptome (>3,000 genes) and ~41% of genome accessibility (>26,000 sites), and these regions are strongly enriched in euchromatin. Importantly, these changes are highly enriched for CTCF occupancy, suggesting direct CTCF binding and transcriptional regulation at these active loci. CTCF mainly promotes chromatin accessibility of these direct binding targets, and a large fraction of these sites correspond to promoters. At these sites, CTCF binding frequently promotes accessibility and inhibits expression, and motifs of transcription repressors are found to be significantly enriched. Our findings provide different and often opposite conclusions from previous studies, emphasizing the need to consider cell heterogeneity and cell type specificity when performing multi-omics analyses. We conclude that the architectural protein CTCF binds chromatin and regulates global chromatin accessibility and transcription during rod development.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Cases of chronic viral infection have been suggested as an explanation for this phenomenon, whereby an extended period of infection, with an increased rate of evolution, creates viruses with substantial genetic novelty. However, measuring a rate of evolution during chronic infection is made more difficult by the potential existence of compartmentalisation in the viral population, whereby the viruses in a host form distinct subpopulations. We here describe and apply a novel statistical method to study within-host virus evolution, identifying the minimum number of subpopulations required to explain sequence data observed from cases of chronic infection, and inferring rates for within-host viral evolution. Across nine cases of chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalised patients we find that non-trivial population structure is relatively common, with four cases showing evidence of more than one viral population evolving independently within the host. We find cases of within-host evolution proceeding significantly faster, and significantly slower, than that of the global SARS-CoV-2 population, and of cases in which viral subpopulations in the same host have statistically distinguishable rates of evolution. Non-trivial population structure was associated with high rates of within-host evolution that were systematically underestimated by a more standard inference method.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

The involvement of the immune system in the pathology of MS is well established, particularly the adaptive T cell response, and there has been a particular focus on the IL-17-producing subset of Th17 cells and their role in driving disease. However, the importance of innate immune cells has not been so well characterised. Here we focused on neutrophils, which are innate immune cells and rapid responders to inflammation, and which have recently been linked to other chronic autoimmune conditions. Multiple strands of evidence in patients with MS and in mice with the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis MS model suggest neutrophils may play a role in driving MS inflammation. Here, we performed proteomic analysis on neutrophils from patients with MS and healthy donors, revealing striking differences. In particular, granule proteins were significantly more abundant in the MS neutrophils compared to the healthy controls, with a particular over-abundance of proteins in primary and secondary granules. In addition, members of the MAVS signalling pathway were differently regulated compared to healthy donor cells. Finally, we find that MS neutrophils do not suppress T cell activation equivalently to healthy neutrophils, and in particular are unable to suppress expression of CD161 on the T cells, indicative of Th17 differentiation. We propose that neutrophil dysregulation in MS may contribute to dysfunctional T cell responses.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Furthermore, quantitative comparisons of stiffness distributions of preserved tissue samples unveiled the distinct impacts of conventional tissue preservation techniques on the tissue stiffness pattern.

Yet, how the interaction of alpha synuclein and a specific immune response participates to Parkinson's disease ontogenesis has remained unanswered. Here, we reveal that autoimmune response to an alpha synuclein antigen underlies Parkinson's disease. We demonstrate that autoimmunity mediated by CD4+T cell activation with alpha synuclein alpha syn61-75 antigen is required to lead to immune cell infiltration and localized inflammation in the substantia nigra, triggering dopaminergic cell neurodegeneration and deficits in locomotion and gait kinematics. This study offers the first immune-induced mouse model that recapitulates all features of Parkinson's disease to study the mechanisms triggering disease onset. It provides the basis for temporally tracking symptom development, exploring preventive strategies and prodromal therapeutic interventions in Parkinson's Disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Mutations to estrogen receptor alpha (ER) arise after continued therapeutic pressure. Next generation selective estrogen receptor modulators and degraders/downregulators (SERMs and SERDs) show clinical efficacy, but responses are often non-durable. A tyrosine to serine point mutation at position 537 in the ER ligand binding domain (LBD) is among the most common and most pathogenic alteration in this setting. It enables endocrine therapy resistance by superceding intrinsic structural-energetic gatekeepers of ER hormone-dependence, it enhances metastatic burden by enabling neomorphic ER-dependent transcriptional programs, and it resists SERM and SERD inhibition by reducing their binding affinities and abilities to antagonize transcriptional coregulator binding. However, a subset of SERMs and SERDs can achieve efficacy by adopting poses that force the mutation to engage in a new interaction that favors the therapeutic receptor antagonist conformation. We previously described a chemically unconventional SERM, T6I-29, that demonstrates significant anti-proliferative activities in Y537S ER breast cancer cells. Here, we use a comprehensive suite of structural-biochemical, in vitro, and in vivo approaches to better T6I-29's activities in breast cancer cells harboring Y537S ER. RNA sequencing in cells treated with T6I-29 reveals a neomorphic downregulation of DKK1, a secreted glycoprotein known to play oncogenic roles in other cancers. Importantly, we find that DKK1 is significantly enriched in ER+ breast cancer plasma compared to healthy controls. This study shows how new SERMs and SERDs can identify new therapeutic pathways in endocrine-resistant ER+ breast cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Therefore, PLCG2, which is primarily expressed in immune cells, has become a target of interest for potential therapeutic intervention. The protective allele, known as P522R, has been shown to be hyper-morphic in microglia, increasing phagocytosis of amyloid-beta (A{beta}), and increasing the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, the effect of this protective mutation on peripheral tissue-resident macrophages, and the extent to which sex modifies this effect, has yet to be assessed. Herein, we show that peripheral macrophages from wild-type (WT) female and male mice harbor intrinsic differences, with macrophages from females exhibiting less phagocytosis and lysosomal protease activity, as well as a more pro-inflammatory phenotype upon stimulation compared to those from male mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the P522R mutation does indeed alter peripheral macrophage function in a sex-dependent manner, with more prominent effects seen in females, including pushing macrophages from females toward an M2 protective phenotype that more closely resembles macrophages from males. These results suggest that the P522R mutation may be partially conferring protection against protein aggregation via activation of peripheral immune cell function and underscore the importance of considering sex as a biological variable when assessing the viability of potential immune system-targeted therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Here, we discovered a system of periodically arranged endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions tiling the plasma membrane of dendrites at ~1 m intervals, interlinked by a meshwork of ER tubules patterned in a ladder-like array. Populated with Junctophilin-linked plasma membrane voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and ER Ca2+-release channels (ryanodine receptors), ER-PM junctions are hubs for ER-PM crosstalk, fine-tuning of Ca2+ homeostasis, and local activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Local spine stimulation activates the Ca2+ modulatory machinery facilitating voltage-independent signal transmission and ryanodine receptor-dependent Ca2+ release at ER-PM junctions over 20 m away. Thus, interconnected ER-PM junctions support signal propagation and Ca2+ release from the spine-adjacent ER. The capacity of this subcellular architecture to modify both local and distant membrane-proximal biochemistry potentially contributes to dendritic computations.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

The RNAPII-associated cleavage product is then degraded by XRN2, dislodging RNAPII from the DNA template. In contrast, prokaryotic RNAP and eukaryotic RNAPIII often terminate directly at T-tracts in the coding DNA strand. Here, we demonstrate a similar and omnipresent capability for mammalian RNAPII. XRN2- and T-tract-dependent termination are independent - the latter usually acting when XRN2 cannot be engaged. We show that T-tracts terminate snRNA transcription, previously thought to require the Integrator complex. Importantly, we find genome-wide termination at T-tracts in promoter-proximal regions, but not within protein-coding gene bodies. XRN2-dependent termination dominates downstream of protein-coding genes, but the T-tract process is sometimes employed. Overall, we demonstrate global DNA-directed attrition of RNAPII transcription, suggesting that RNAPs retain the potential to terminate over T-rich sequences throughout evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

A long-standing hypothesis postulates that scales are homologous to the well-described mechanosensory bristles found in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, where both derive from an epithelial precursor specified by lateral inhibition that then undergoes multiple rounds of division. Previous histological examination and candidate gene approaches identified parallels in genes involved in scale and the bristle development. Here, we provide definitive developmental and transcriptomic evidence that the differentiation of lepidopteran scales derives from the canonical cell lineage, known as the Sensory Organ Precursor (SOP). Live imaging in moth and butterfly pupae shows that SOP cells undergo two rounds of asymmetric divisions that first abrogate the neurogenic lineage, and then lead to a differentiated scale precursor and its associated socket cell. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing across a time-series of early pupal development reveals differential gene expression patterns that mirror canonical lineage development, including Notch-Delta signalling components, cell adhesion molecules, cell cycling factors, and terminal cell differentiation markers, suggesting a shared origin of the SOP developmental program. Additionally, we recovered a novel gene, the POU-domain transcription factor pdm3, involved in the proper differentiation of butterfly wing scales. Altogether, these data open up avenues for understanding scale type specification and development, and illustrate how single-cell transcriptomics provide a powerful platform for understanding the evolution of cell types.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

High quality whole genome sequencing is essential to research mycobacterial epidemiology, pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance.

Despite outnumbering Bacteria and Archaea by an order of magnitude, viruses have been comparatively underrepresented in reference databases. Metagenomic examinations have illustrated that viruses of Bacteria and Archaea have been specifically understudied in engineered environments. Here we employed metagenomic and computational biology methods to examine the diversity, host interactions, and genetic systems of viruses predicted from 27 samples taken from three municipal landfills across North America. Results: We identified numerous viruses that are not represented in reference databases, including the third largest bacteriophage genome identified to date (~678 kbp), and note a cosmopolitan diversity of viruses in landfills that are distinct from viromes in other systems. Host-virus interactions were examined via host CRISPR spacer to viral protospacer mapping which captured hyper-targeted viral populations and six viral populations predicted to infect across multiple phyla. Virally-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were identified with the potential to augment hosts' methane, sulfur, and contaminant degradation metabolisms, including AMGs not previously reported in literature. CRISPR arrays and CRISPR-Cas systems were identified from predicted viral genomes, including the two largest bacteriophage genomes to contain these genetic features. Some virally encoded Cas effector proteins appear distinct relative to previously reported Cas systems and are interesting targets for potential genome editing tools. Conclusions: Our observations indicate landfills, as heterogeneous contaminated sites with unique selective pressures, are key locations for diverse viruses and atypical virus-host dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

The regulatory interplay between a TFs function and promoter features can be complex due to the lack of systematic genetic control in the natural cellular environment. To address this, we use a library of E. coli strains with precise control of TF copy number. We measure the quantitative regulatory input-output function of 90 TFs on synthetic promoters that isolate the contributions of TF binding sequence, location, and basal promoter strength to gene expression, uncovering TF specific regulatory principles. We infer that many of these TFs function by stabilizing RNA polymerase at the promoter, a property we see for both activating and repressing TFs. We develop a thermodynamic model that predicts stabilizing TFs have a specific quantitative relationship with promoters of differential strength. We test this prediction using synthetic promoters spanning over 100-fold range in basal expression levels and confirm that stronger promoters have lower fold-change for stabilizing TFs, whereas non-stabilizing TFs do not exhibit this relationship, indicating a conserved mechanism of transcription control across distinct TFs. This work demonstrates that understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of TF function is central to decoding the relationship between sequence and gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

K. pneumoniae infections are historically associated with diabetes mellitus. There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2 diabetes, influences K. pneumoniae pathogenesis. K. pneumoniae pathogenesis is a multifactorial process that often begins with gut colonization, followed by an escape from the gut to peripheral sites, leading to host damage and infection. We hypothesized that type 2 diabetes enhances K. pneumoniae pathogenesis. To test this, we used well-established mouse models of K. pneumoniae colonization and lung infection in conjunction with a mouse model of spontaneous type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We show that T2DM enhances susceptibility to both K. pneumoniae colonization and infection. The enhancement of gut colonization is dependent on T2DM-induced modulation of the gut microbiota community structure. In contrast, lung infection is exacerbated by the increased availability of amino acids in the lung, which is associated with higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. These data lay the foundation for mechanistic interrogation of the relationship between K. pneumoniae pathogenesis and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and explicitly establish T2DM as a risk factor for K. pneumoniae disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

In one hand, the benthic diatoms display photo-protective strategies to face extreme light variations susceptible to generate cellular oxidative stress. In the other hand, oxidative stress induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that generate oxylipins, oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are among the known chemical mediators in diatoms. However, non-enzymatically generated oxylipins known as isoprostanoids or isofuranoids are poorly studied in diatoms. To better understand the roles of the latter in migrational MPB light response, we investigated the effect of different light irradiances corresponding to dark (D), low light (LL, 50 and 100 {micro}mol. photons. m-2. s-1PAR), medium light (ML, 250 {micro}mol. photons. m-2. s-1 PAR), high light (HL, 500, 750 and 1000 {micro}mol. photons. m-2. s-1PAR), on the isoprostanoids production by the biofilms organisms. The PUFAs precursors of the varying oxylipins evidenced a diatoms response to light irradiance. Under 1000 PAR condition, the total amount of isoprotanoids increased, indicating an oxidative stress response. Isoprostanes (IsoPs) and prostaglandins (PGs) characterized the HL conditions and evidenced lipid peroxidation probably linked to the higher generation of ROS by the photosynthesis. On the contrary, the phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) characterized the LL and ML where the de-epoxidation state was low and ROS scavengers probably not overwhelmed. This first investigation of non-enzymatic oxylipin production by a microphytobenthic biofilm under different light irradiances highlighted the interest to explore their potential signaling roles related to MPB light responses.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

However, it remains unclear whether similar biological processes occur during healthy aging, albeit to a lesser degree. We therefore determined whether midbrain DA neurons degenerate during aging in mice and humans. In mice, we identified no changes in midbrain neuron numbers throughout aging. Despite this, we found age-related decreases in midbrain mRNA expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), the rate limiting enzyme of DA synthesis. Among midbrain glutamatergic cells, we similarly identified age-related declines in vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (Vglut2) mRNA expression. In co-transmitting Th+/Vglut2+ neurons, Th and Vglut2 transcripts decreased with aging. Importantly, striatal Th and Vglut2 protein expression remained unchanged. In translating our findings to humans, we found no midbrain neurodegeneration during aging and identified age-related decreases in TH and VGLUT2 mRNA expression similar to mouse. Unlike mice, we discovered diminished density of striatal TH+ dopaminergic terminals in aged human subjects. However, TH and VGLUT2 protein expression were unchanged in the remaining striatal boutons. Finally, in contrast to Th and Vglut2 mRNA, expression of most ribosomal genes in Th+ neurons was either maintained or even upregulated during aging. This suggests a homeostatic mechanism where age-related declines in transcriptional efficiency are overcome by ongoing ribosomal translation. Overall, we demonstrate species-conserved transcriptional effects of aging in midbrain dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurons that are not accompanied by marked cell death or lower striatal protein expression. This opens the door to novel therapeutic approaches to maintain neurotransmission and bolster neuronal resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Our understanding of how animals evolved this exquisite regulatory control remains elusive, but evidence suggests that changes in chromatin-based mechanisms may have contributed. To investigate this possibility, here we examine chromatin-based gene regulatory features in the closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. Using Salpingoeca rosetta as a model system, we examined chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the genome scale and compared these features to gene expression. We first observed that accessible regions of chromatin are primarily associated with gene promoters and found no evidence of distal gene regulatory elements resembling the enhancers that animals deploy to regulate developmental gene expression. Remarkably, a histone modification deposited by polycomb repressive complex 2, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), appeared to function similarly in S. rosetta to its role in animals, because this modification decorated genes with cell type-specific expression. Additionally, H3K27me3 marked transposons, retaining what appears to be an ancestral role in regulating these elements. We further uncovered a putative new bivalent chromatin state at cell type-specific genes that consists of H3K27me3 and histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1). Together, our discoveries support the scenario that gene-associated histone modification states that underpin development emerged before the evolution of animal multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.

In this study, conducted within a national health provider, we examined the impact of vaccination and medication purchase on PD occurrence and severity, using an innovative machine learning algorithm to track disease progression.

Our findings reveal a significant reduction in PD occurrence following anti-tetanus vaccination, with a time-dependent association between the elapsed time since vaccination and both the rate and progression of PD. These results are supported by evidence that antimicrobial treatments significantly alter disease severity, suggesting the actual involvement of Clostridium Tetani in PD pathology.

Benchmarking of the available methods has revealed general tradeoffs between accuracy and scalability, but performance in downstream applications has not always been easily predictable from general performance measures, suggesting that specific features of the ARG may be important for specific downstream applications of estimated ARGs. To exemplify this point, we benchmark ARG estimation methods with respect to a specific set of methods for estimating the historical time course of a population-mean polygenic score (PGS) using the marginal coalescent trees encoded by the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Here we examine the performance in simulation of six ARG estimation methods: ARGweaver, RENT+, Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust, and SINGER, using their estimated coalescent trees and examining bias, mean squared error (MSE), confidence interval coverage, and Type I and II error rates of the downstream methods. Although it does not scale to the sample sizes attainable by other new methods, SINGER produced the most accurate estimated PGS histories in many instances, even when Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, and ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust used samples ten times as large as those used by SINGER. In general, the best choice of method depends on the number of samples available and the historical time period of interest. In particular, the unprecedented sample sizes allowed by Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, and ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust are of greatest importance when the recent past is of interest--further back in time, most of the tree has coalesced, and differences in contemporary sample size are less salient.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

The Episodic Disability Framework (EDF), derived from perspectives of adults living with HIV, characterizes the multidimensional and episodic nature of health-related challenges (disability) experienced by an individual. Our aim was to determine the applicability of the Episodic Disability Framework to conceptualize the health-related challenges experienced among adults living with Long COVID.

MethodsWe conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving online semi-structured interviews. We recruited adults who self-identified as living with Long COVID via collaborator community organizations in Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States. We purposively recruited for diversity in age, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and time since initial COVID-19 infection. We used a semi-structured interview guide informed by the EDF to explore experiences of disability living with Long COVID, specifically health-related challenges and how challenges were experienced over time. We conducted a group-based content analysis.

ResultsOf the 40 participants, the median age was 39 years; and the majority were white 73%), women (63%), living with Long COVID for [&ge;]1 year (83%). Consistent with the Episodic Disability Framework, disability was described as multidimensional and episodic, characterized by unpredictable periods of health and illness. Experiences of disability were consistent with the three main components of the Framework: A) dimensions of disability (physical, cognitive, mental-emotional health challenges, difficulties with day-to-day activities, challenges to social inclusion, uncertainty); B) contextual factors, extrinsic (social support; accessibility of environment and health services; stigma and epistemic injustice) and intrinsic (living strategies; personal attributes) that exacerbate or alleviate dimensions of disability; and C) triggers that initiate episodes of disability.

ConclusionsThe Episodic Disability Framework provides a way to conceptualize disability the multidimensional and episodic nature of disability experienced by adults living with Long COVID. The Framework provides guidance for future measurement of disability, and health and rehabilitation approaches to enhance practice, research, and policy in Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885494

Neural pathologies are often associated with anatomical changes in these axonal projections and synaptic connections. Notably, axonal density variations of local and long-range projections increase or decrease as a function of the strengthening or weakening, respectively, of the information flow between brain regions. Traditionally, histological quantification of axonal inputs relied on assessing the mean fluorescence intensity within a rectangle placed in the brain region-of-interest. Despite yielding valuable insights, this conventional method is notably susceptible to background fluorescence, post-acquisition adjustments, and inter-researcher variability. Additionally, it fails to account for the non-uniform innervation across brain regions, thus overlooking critical data such as innervation percentages and axonal distribution patterns. In response to these chal-lenges, we introduce AxoDen, an open-source semi-automated platform designed to increase the speed and rigor of axon quantifications for basic neuroscience discovery. AxoDen processes user-defined brain regions-of-interests incorporating dynamic thresholding of grayscales-transformed images to facilitate binarized pixel measurements. Thereby AxoDen segregates the image content into signal and non-signal categories, effectively eliminating background interference and enabling the exclusive measurement of fluorescence from axonal projections. AxoDen provides detailed and accurate representations of axonal density and spatial distribution. AxoDen's advanced yet user-friendly platform enhances the reliability and efficiency of axonal density analysis and facilitates access to unbiased high-quality data analysis with no technical background or coding experience required.

The integration of ion mobility separation into DIA analysis, such as the diaPASEF technology available on Brukers timsTOF platform, further improves the quantification accuracy and protein depth achievable using DIA. We introduce diaTracer, a new spectrum-centric computational tool optimized for diaPASEF data. diaTracer performs three-dimensional (m/z, retention time, ion mobility) peak tracing and feature detection to generate precursor-resolved ""pseudo-MS/MS"" spectra, facilitating direct (""spectral-library free"") peptide identification and quantification from diaPASEF data. diaTracer is available as a stand-alone tool and is fully integrated into the widely used FragPipe computational platform. We demonstrate the performance of diaTracer and FragPipe using diaPASEF data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples, data from phosphoproteomics and HLA immunopeptidomics experiments, and low-input data from a spatial proteomics study. We also show that diaTracer enables unrestricted identification of post-translational modifications from diaPASEF data using open/mass offset searches.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

A recently published computational approach, IBDGem, analyzes sequencing reads, including from low-coverage samples, in order to arrive at likelihood ratios for tests of identity. Here, we show that likelihood ratios produced by IBDGem test a null hypothesis different from the traditional one used in a forensic genetics context. In particular, rather than testing the hypothesis that the sample comes from a person unrelated to the person of interest, IBDGem tests the hypothesis that the sample comes from an individual who is included in the reference sample used to run the method. This null hypothesis is not generally of forensic interest, because the defense hypothesis is not that the evidence comes from an individual included in a reference panel. Further, it does not take into account genetic variation outside the reference panel, and as a result, the computed likelihood ratios can be much larger than likelihood ratios computed for the standard forensic null hypothesis, often by many orders of magnitude, thus potentially creating an impression of stronger evidence for identity than is warranted. We lay out this result and illustrate it with examples, giving suggestions for directions that might lead to likelihood ratios that have the traditional interpretation.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

VTA cell types are often defined through neurotransmitters (NT). However, valence function in VTA does not parse along NT-boundaries as, within each NT-class, certain neurons are excited by reward and others by stressors. Here we identify the co-activated mouse VTA neuronal ensembles for reward and stress, and determine their role in adaptive behaviors. We show that stimuli of opposite valence (opioid vs acute social stress) recruit two segregated intermingled small VTA neuronal ensembles. These two ensembles continue to be preferentially engaged by congruent valence stimuli. Stimulation of VTA stress- or reward ensembles is aversive/reinforcing, respectively. Strikingly, external valence stimuli fully require activity of these small discrete VTA ensembles for conferring approach/avoidance outcomes. Overall, our study identifies distinct small VTA ensembles for positive and negative valence coding and shows their indispensability for adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

FtsZ recruits other proteins, collectively known as the divisome, that together remodel and constrict the envelope. Constriction is driven by peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall synthesis by the glycosyltransferase FtsW and the transpeptidase FtsI (FtsWI), but these enzymes require activation to function. How recruitment of FtsZ to the division site leads to FtsWI activation and constriction remains largely unknown. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that an FtsZ-binding protein, FzlA, is essential for activation of FtsWI in the alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Additionally, we found that FzlA also binds to a DNA translocase called FtsK, suggesting that it may link constriction activation to chromosome segregation. FzlA is conserved throughout alphaproteobacteria but has only been examined in detail in C. crescentus. Here, we explored whether FzlA function is conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. We assessed FzlA homologs from Rickettsia parkeri and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and found that, similar to C. crescentus FzlA, they bind directly to FtsZ and localize to midcell. The FtsZ-FzlA interaction interface is conserved, as we demonstrated that FzlA from each of the three species examined can bind to FtsZ from any of the three in vitro. Additionally, we determined that A. tumefaciens FzlA can fulfill the essential function of FzlA when produced in C. crescentus, indicating conservation of function. These results suggest that FzlA serves as an important regulator that coordinates chromosome segregation with envelope constriction across diverse alphaproteobacteria.

ImportanceCell division is essential for bacterial replication and must be highly regulated to ensure robust remodeling of the cell wall in coordination with segregation of the genome to daughter cells. In Caulobacter crescentus, FzlA plays a major role in regulating this process by activating cell wall synthesis in a manner that couples constriction to chromosome segregation. FzlA is broadly conserved in alphaproteobacteria suggesting it plays a similar function across this class of bacteria. Here we have shown that, indeed, FzlA biochemical interactions and function are conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. Because FzlA is conserved in alphaproteobacterial human pathogens, understanding this protein and its interactome could present therapeutic benefits by identifying potential antibiotic targets to treat infections.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Inflorescence architecture depends on shape, longevity and determinacy of meristems that direct growth of the main rachis and lateral branches, but how individual meristem activities are determined and integrated within complex inflorescences is not yet understood. We found that activity of distinct meristems in the barley inflorescence is coordinated by a signalling pathway comprising the receptor like kinase Hordeum vulgare CLAVATA1 (HvCLV1) and the secreted CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (CLE)-family peptide FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (HvFCP1). HvFCP1 interacts with HvCLV1 to promote spikelet formation but restricts inflorescence meristem and rachilla meristem proliferation. Hvfcp1 or Hvclv1 mutants generate branched inflorescences with additional rows of spikelets and supernumerary florets. Transcriptome analysis reveals that HvFCP1/HvCLV1 signalling controls inflorescence branching through the regulation of trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis and sugar transport.

E. faecalis also causes infections in root canals, wounds, the urinary tract, and on heart valves. E. faecalis metabolizes arginine through the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway, which converts arginine to ornithine and releases ATP, ammonia, and CO2. E. faecalis arginine metabolism also affects virulence of other pathogens during co-culture. E. faecalis may encounter elevated levels of arginine in the GIT or the oral cavity, where arginine is used as a dental therapeutic. Little is known about how E. faecalis responds to growth in arginine in the absence of other bacteria. To address this, we used RNAseq and additional assays to measure growth, gene expression, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis OG1RF grown in arginine. We demonstrate that arginine decreases E. faecalis biofilm production and causes widespread differential expression of genes related to metabolism, quorum sensing, and polysaccharide synthesis. Growth in arginine also increases aggregation of E. faecalis and promotes decreased susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and ceftriaxone. This work provides a platform for understanding of how the presence of arginine in biological niches affects E. faecalis physiology and virulence of surrounding microbes.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

During blood-stage infection, Plasmodium falciparum parasites internalize and digest abundant host hemoglobin within the digestive vacuole. This massive catabolic process generates copious free heme, most of which is biomineralized into inert hemozoin. Parasites also express a divergent heme oxygenase (HO)-like protein (PfHO) that lacks key active-site residues and has lost canonical HO activity. The cellular role of this unusual protein that underpins its retention by parasites has been unknown. To unravel PfHO function, we first determined a 2.8 [A]-resolution X-ray structure that revealed a highly -helical fold indicative of distant HO homology. Localization studies unveiled PfHO targeting to the apicoplast organelle, where it is imported and undergoes N-terminal processing but retains most of the electropositive transit peptide. We observed that conditional knockdown of PfHO was lethal to parasites, which died from defective apicoplast biogenesis and impaired isoprenoid-precursor synthesis. Complementation and molecular-interaction studies revealed an essential role for the electropositive N-terminus of PfHO, which selectively associates with the apicoplast genome and enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. PfHO knockdown resulted in a specific deficiency in levels of apicoplast-encoded RNA but not DNA. These studies reveal an essential function for PfHO in apicoplast maintenance and suggest that Plasmodium repurposed the conserved HO scaffold from its canonical heme-degrading function in the ancestral chloroplast to fulfill a critical adaptive role in organelle gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

Here we performed such rescues with a panel of receptor variants and promoters, in combination with tissue-specific transgene knockouts. Our experiments demonstrate that brassinosteroid receptor expression in several tissues is necessary but not sufficient for rescue.

Here, we use a cross-species design to investigate the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. We find that LgDel mice, an established mouse model of 22q11DS, exhibit age-specific patterns of functional MRI (fMRI) dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyper-connectivity in juvenile mice reverting to focal hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These fMRI connectivity alterations are mirrored by co-occurring developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and are both transiently normalized by developmental GSK3{beta} inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous hyper-to hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs also in human 22q11DS, where it affects hippocampal and cortical regions spatially enriched for synaptic genes that interact with GSK3{beta}, and autism-relevant transcripts. Functional dysconnectivity in somatomotor components of this network is predictive of age-dependent social alterations in 22q11.2 deletion carriers.

A recent notion that most psychotropics are detrimental to the gut microbiota has arisen from consistent findings of metabolic adverse effects. However, unlike olanzapine, the metabolic effects of lurasidone are conflicting, with most reports observing weight loss rather than gain. Thus, this study investigates the contrasting effects of olanzapine and lurasidone on the gut microbiota to explore the hypothesis of ""gut neutrality"" for lurasidone exposure.

Experimental ApproachUsing a Sprague-Dawley rat model, the impact of olanzapine and lurasidone administration on the gut microbiota was explored. Faecal and blood samples were collected weekly over a 21-day period to analyse changes to the gut microbiota and related metabolic markers.

Key ResultsLurasidone triggered no significant weight gain or metabolic alterations, instead positively modulating gut microbiota through increases in mean OTUs (+50 OTUs) and alpha diversity (+0.5 increase in Shannons index). This novel finding suggests an underlying mechanism for lurasidones metabolic inertia. In contrast, olanzapine triggered a statistically significant decrease in mean OTUs (-75 OTUs) and substantial compositional variation, suggesting a decrease in microbial richness. Microbiota alterations correlated with metabolic dysfunction, evidenced through a statistically significant 30% increase in weight gain, increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and increase in blood triglycerides and glycaemic levels.

Conclusion and ImplicationsThe study challenges the notion that all antipsychotics disrupt the gut microbiota similarly and highlights the potential benefits of gut positive or neutral antipsychotics like lurasidone in managing metabolic side effects. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in humans to guide personalised pharmacological treatment regimens for schizophrenia.

We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment.

The experiment was replicated over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were reversed, yielding 60 treatment and 60 control sites and 720 artificial nests.

3. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.

4. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

In contrast with attention-based models, ProtMamba efficiently handles very long context, comprising hundreds of protein sequences. We train ProtMamba on a large dataset of concatenated homologous sequences, using two GPUs. We combine autoregressive modeling and masked language modeling through a fill-in-the-middle training objective. This makes the model adapted to various protein design applications.

The mechanisms of cognitive impairment after COVID-19 (COGVID) remain unclear, but neuroimaging studies provide evidence of brain changes, many that are associated with aging. Therefore, we calculated Brain Age Gap (BAG), which is the difference between brain age and chronological age, in a cohort of 25 mild to moderate COVID-19 survivors (did not experience breathlessness, pneumonia, or respiratory/organ failure) and 24 non-infected controls (mean age = 30 +/- 8) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). BAG was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (F = 4.22, p = 0.046) by 2.65 years. Additionally, 80% of the COVID-19 group demonstrated an accelerated BAG compared to 13% in the control group (X2 = 20.0, p < 0.001). Accelerated BAG was significantly correlated with lower cognitive function (p < 0.041). Females in the COVID-19 group demonstrated a 99% decreased risk of accelerated BAG compared to males (OR = 0.015, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.300). There was also a small (1.4%) but significant decrease in risk for accelerated BAG associated with longer time since COVID-19 diagnosis (OR = 0.986, 95% CI: 0.977 to 0.995). Our findings provide a novel biomarker of COGVID and point to accelerated brain aging as a potential mechanism of this adverse effect.

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885494

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera.

CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885494

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885494

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885494

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717365885495

Systematic review identified thirty-nine studies that suffered from one particular and serious form of bias called miscategorisation bias, whereby study participants who have been vaccinated are categorised as unvaccinated up to and until some arbitrarily defined time after vaccination occurred. Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy. Furthermore, simulation demonstrates that repeated boosters, given every few months, are needed to maintain this misleading impression of efficacy. Given this, any claims of Covid-19 vaccine efficacy based on these studies are likely to be a statistical illusion.","NA","medrxiv",1717365885495
