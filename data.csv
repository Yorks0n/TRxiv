Here, we visualized the changes in calcium signaling and organelle behavior after activation of the NRC4 (NLR-required for cell death 4) resistosome. We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization. Subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear shrinkage, and vacuolar collapse mark the terminal stage of cell death. Our findings reveal a spatiotemporally-resolved cascade of subcellular events downstream of resistosome activation, providing new mechanistic insight into the execution phase of plant immune cell death.","[{""name"":""National Science and Technology Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02kv4zf79"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NSTC-113-2628-B-001-004;NSTC-113-2927-I-001-514;""},{""name"":""Institute of Plant and Microbial Biology, Academia Sinica"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X016382/1;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IECNSFC233289;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

Reaggregated early gastrula cells (here called gastruloids) of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis are able to regenerate with only little delay whole organisms that are virtually indistinguishable from normal developing polyps. However, the molecular control underlying the restoration of body axis and germ layers remains largely unknown. To address this, we established a standardized protocol, which reproducibly generates gastruloids developing into polys with a single body axis. Here, we show that committed mesodermal and endodermal cells are sorted out to the surface of the aggregate, where mesodermal cells form clusters of about 30 cells. At a critical time point, one mesodermal cluster immigrates, along with peripherally attached endodermal cells. Thereby, the inner germ layer and the oral-aboral axis is established in one and the same process. Functional studies demonstrated that this polarization of the endodermal cells requires a feedback loop of Notch and Wnt signaling. The dissociation of the early embryo disrupts Notch signaling in the endodermal cells, which leads to transient adoption of an endomesodermal profile, marked by the expression of the mesodermal cadherin1 until the boundaries between the germ layer identities are re-established. Our results highlight distinct morphogenetic behaviors of mesodermal and endodermal cells and the hitherto unknown role of Notch signaling in germ layer boundary formation in self-organizing gastruloids. Conservation of Notch-mediated boundary formation between endoderm and mesoderm mirrors bilaterian mechanisms, demonstrating how adoption of ancestral regulatory networks governing morphogenesis likely enabled the diversification of metazoan body plans.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P34404;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

However, their analysis is complicated by measurement noise and bias, differences between batches, technology platforms, and restricted antibody panels. This results in a limited capacity to accumulate knowledge across technologies, studies, experimental batches, or across different antibody panels. Here, we present CytoVI - a probabilistic generative model designed to address these challenges and enable statistically rigorous and integrative analysis for antibody-based single cell technologies. We show that CytoVI outperforms existing computational methods and effectively handles a variety of integration scenarios. CytoVI enables key functionalities such as generating informative cell embeddings, imputing missing measurements, differential protein expression testing, and automated annotation of cells. We applied CytoVI to generate an integrated B cell maturation atlas across 350 proteins from a set of smaller antibody panels measured by conventional mass cytometry, and identified proteins associated with immunoglobulin class-switching in healthy humans. Using a cohort of B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients measured by flow cytometry, CytoVI uncovered T cell states that are associated with disease. Finally, we show that CytoVI is a robust probabilistic framework for the analysis of standard diagnostic flow cytometry antibody panels, enabling the automated detection of tumor populations and diagnoses of incoming patient samples.

Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)1,2, but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality3. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism. More broadly, our approach combining microfluidics-based synchronization of signalling in multicellular systems with omics analyses can be applied to study dynamics in other contexts such as in tissue homeostasis4 and regeneration5.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

Exciton dynamics within LH2 complexes are controlled by the structural arrangement and energy levels of the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and carotenoid (Car) pigments. However, there is still debate over the competing light-harvesting versus energy-dissipation pathways. In this work, we compared five variants of the LH2 complex from genetically modified strains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, all containing the same BChls but different Cars with increasing conjugation: zeta-carotene (N=7; LH2Zeta), neurosporene (N=9; LH2Neu), spheroidene (N=10; LH2Spher), lycopene (N=11; LH2Lyco), and spirilloxanthin (N=13; LH2Spir). Absorption measurements confirmed that Car excited state energy decreased with increasing conjugation. Similarly, fluorescence spectra showed that the B850 BChl emission peak had an increasing red shift from LH2Zeta[-&gt;](LH2Neu/LH2Spher)[-&gt;]LH2Lyco[-&gt;]LH2Spir. In contrast, time-resolved fluorescence and ultrafast transient absorption (fs-TA) revealed similar excited state lifetimes ([~]1 ns) for all complexes except LH2Spir ([~]0.7 ns). From fs-TA analysis, an additional [~]7 ps non-radiative dissipation step from B850 BChl was observed for LH2Zeta. Further, singlet-singlet and singlet-triplet annihilation studies showed a [~]50% average fluorescence lifetime reduction in LH2Zeta at high laser power and high repetition rate, compared to [~]10-15% reductions in LH2Neu/LH2Spher/LH2Lyco and minimal lifetime change in LH2Spir. In LH2Zeta, the fastest decay component (<50 ps) became prominent at high repetition rates, consistent with strong singlet-triplet annihilation. Nanosecond TA measurements revealed long-lived (>40 s) BChl triplet states in LH2Zeta and signs of damage caused by singlet oxygen, whereas other LH2s showed faster triplet quenching ([~]18 ns) by Cars. These findings highlight a key design principle of LH2 complexes: the Car triplet energy must be significantly lower than the BChl triplet energy to efficiently quench BChl triplets that otherwise act as potent ""trap states"" causing exciton annihilation in laser-based experiments or photo-damage in native membranes.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W004593/1;BB/W005719/1;BB/R000174/1;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""URFR241006;""},{""name"":""Office of Basic Energy Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mg91w61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0018097;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""564394927;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

EXPAND focuses on a core set of 12 nuclear pathologist-interpretable features (NPIFs), composing the Nottingham grading criteria used by the pathologists. It is a fully automated, end-to-end diagnostic workflow, which automatically extracts NPIFs given a patient tumor slide and uses them to predict tumor subtype and survival. EXPANDs performance is comparable to that of existing deep learning non-interpretable black box AI models. It achieves areas under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.73, 0.79 and 0.75 for predicting HER2+, HR+ and TNBC tumor subtypes, respectively, matching the performance of proprietary models that rely on substantially larger and more complex interpretable feature sets. The 12 NPIFs demonstrate strong and independent prognostic value for patient survival, underscoring their potential as biologically grounded, interpretable biomarkers for survival stratification in BC. These results lay the basis for building interpretable AI diagnostic models in other cancer indications.

Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""948891;""},{""name"":""Ministero dell'Università e della Ricerca"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R2049C8YN3;2022BNE97C;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

Traditionally, ecological factors have been the primary focus of species distribution studies, but recent work emphasizes the importance of rapid evolution through local adaptation. Here, we focus on adaptation to changing temperatures, which is one of the central challenges populations face today. Importantly, thermal adaptation may be affected by the underlying thermodynamics. Despite many existing models in the fields of thermal biology and spatial evolutionary ecology, there is little integrative theory. However, understanding and modelling the thermodynamic constraints on thermal adaptation is likely essential for more nuanced predictions of the impacts of climate change. By integrating molecular mechanisms and population dynamics in a unified modelling framework, we here study how temperature-dependent processes at the protein level influence the macroecological patterns of range expansions. Our results highlight the importance of the microscopic processes underlying thermal adaptation for capturing the evolutionary ecology of range expansions. Specifically, the molecular bases of thermal adaptation define how and how fast thermal performance can evolve, which determines range expansion speeds. In general, our framework predicts that adaptation to warmer temperatures will be easier than adaptation to cold. Our study underscores the necessity for more interdisciplinary work, combining molecular mechanisms with population dynamics in space in order to improve climate change modeling, enhance prediction accuracy and provide better information for management and conservation of natural populations.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-19-CE02-0015;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

Yet this raises a paradox: if there is such strong selection for optimal display choreography within species, how do courtship displays diversify so extensively between species? To address this, we measure how the choreography of courtship changes among allopatric populations of the dancing dune fly - Apotropina ornatipennis Malloch (Diptera: Chloropidae) - a species in which males and females spend their days cavorting on Australias hot sandy beaches. Merging population genetics with detailed quantification of the courtship display we explore which elements of the display are the first to diverge between isolated populations, whether new behaviours arise rapidly, and whether sequence rearrangements occur in the modular structure of the display. We find that these tiny flies express courtship repertoires approaching the levels of visual complexity seen in birds of paradise. Yet despite clear genetic and geographic isolation, the complex choreography of courtship displays is stable among populations. In contrast to the notion that courtship behaviour should be highly evolvable and rapidly diverge among allopatric populations, our findings suggests that the complex choreography of courtship can instead act as a stabilising feature that limits divergence over short evolutionary timescales.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

In human-occupied areas, prolonged habituation to human activity could therefore lead to relaxed antipredator behavior by prey species, which can be detrimental when predators return or if individuals are translocated to new areas that host predators. We conducted behavioral trials to test whether exposure of Guenthers dik-dik (Madoqua guentheri) to human activity affected habituation to humans and, by extension, response to predation cues. We hypothesized that dik-diks living in areas with higher levels of human activity would exhibit shorter flight initiation distances and spend less time responding to predation cues than those in areas with less human activity, but would respond more strongly to non-specific predation cues (i.e., alarm calls from white-browed sparrow-weavers, a locally common bird) than to cues associated with predators that avoid human activity (i.e., hyena vocalizations). Flight initiation distance and responses to both sparrow-weaver alarm calls and hyena vocalizations varied predictably with differences in human activity: dik-diks living in areas with more human activity had shorter flight initiation distances and spent less time responding to predation cues than those living in areas with less human activity, but responded more strongly to the sparrow-weaver alarm calls than hyena vocalizations in the area with the highest level of human activity. As human populations expand and overlap increasingly with predators, human settlements and activities may increase susceptibility of prey to predators by increasing prey naivety to predators that avoid humans. These results are particularly relevant for ecotourism in working landscapes and translocation of habituated animals, both of which may increase prey naivety.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

The dentate gyrus (DG) is essential to memory formation, but the distinct roles of its excitatory cell types, granule cells (GCs) and mossy cells (MCs), remain unclear. To evaluate how GC and MC activity affect hippocampal output, we recorded from CA1 using two-photon calcium imaging as head-fixed mice navigated familiar and novel virtual environments. DREADD-mediated MC inhibition disrupted initial map stabilization, decreasing spatial stability in novel, but not familiar, environments. In contrast, GC inhibition increased map stability in familiar, but not novel, environments by disrupting drift of spatial maps across distinct experiences (episodes) within an environment. These results reveal how distinct DG cell types support hippocampal memory formation in context-dependent ways; MCs promote stabilization of new spatial maps to support accurate memory recall, while GCs promote flexibility to update existing representations.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F32-NS124752;DP2-NS111657;NS127123;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RO1-MH136274;""},{""name"":""Whitehall Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00her7k05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alfred P.

We previously characterized two activating alleles of KRAS, A59T and A59E, that show impaired BRAF dimerization. These alleles of KRAS are enriched in CRC tumors with genetic alterations in genes that regulate MAPK signaling (e.g. EGFR, NF1). Using a new conditional mouse model of K-Ras (LSL-K-Ras A59E) we show that, despite its inability to universally activate RAF kinases, K-Ras A59E disturbs colon epithelium and decreases mouse survival in a tumor model. By combining LSL-K-Ras A59E mice with a conditional knockout of Nf1, we demonstrate cooperation between these alleles at multiple levels. Consistent with cooperation and clinical observations, we show that K-Ras A59E neither promotes EGF independence of organoid growth, nor confers intrinsic resistance to EGFR inhibition. Thus, our data provide a deeper understanding of the role of RAF isoforms in mutant KRAS driven CRC and argue for the use of anti-EGFR therapies against some Ala59 mutant alleles of KRAS.

Statement of significanceOur studies on oncogenic K-RAS mutants demonstrate that the biochemical properties of a mutant oncoprotein are reflected in the somatic genetics of cancer, in particular in the cooperating mutations that occur. These mutant-specific genetic interactions influence therapeutic responses. As such, KRAS mutation may not be a univariate predictor of response to EGFR inhibition.","[{""name"":""American Cancer Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02e463172"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PF-17-066-01-TBG;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

Although the thermoregulatory systems in the preoptic area are well documented, the downstream processing of these central signals--particularly by medullary neurons involved in the control of shivering and sympathetic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT)--remains incompletely understood. Here we show that vesicular glutamate transporter type 3 (vGluT3)-expressing neurons in the medullary raphe pallidus (RPa) become active immediately before a spontaneous increase in body temperature. These neurons remain inactive under experimentally induced hypometabolic conditions and are necessary for rapid recovery from hypothermia. Furthermore, they communicate with multiple brainstem systems involved in the integration of thermal cues. Notably, RPa-vGluT3 neurons can drive shivering via specific brainstem premotor neurons, in addition to regulating sympathetic outflows for BAT thermogenesis and heat-conserving piloerection. These data indicate that RPa-vGluT3 neurons function as medullary hubs, coordinating sympathetic and somatic motor outputs to increase body temperature.

Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism involving WNK signaling that directly controls the synaptic diffusion and clustering, as well as the membrane stability and endocytosis of inhibitory GABAA receptors (GABAARs). We show that activation of WNK signaling stabilizes GABAARs at inhibitory synapses, while inhibition enhances receptor internalization. This regulation depends on the phosphorylation state of two previously uncharacterized residues in the central linker region of the gephyrin scaffold protein. Modulating WNK activity alters neuronal activity and the kinetics of GABAergic currents. In vivo, expression of a phospho-mimetic form of gephyrin at WNK-targeted sites produces anxiolytic effects. By orchestrating the recruitment of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses, the WNK pathway emerges as a master regulator of GABAergic transmission and establishes chloride as a bona fide second messenger in inhibitory synaptic signaling.

SignificanceSynaptic transmission relies on signaling pathways that control how neurotransmitter receptors move and stabilize at synapses. Many of these pathways use calcium as a second messenger. In contrast, how chloride might regulate synapses has remained unclear. In this study, we identify a chloride-sensitive pathway involving the WNK1 kinase and its partner SPAK, which controls the movement and stability of inhibitory GABAA receptors at synapses. This occurs through the phosphorylation of gephyrin, a key scaffolding protein, at two newly identified sites. Our results show that intracellular chloride can act as a second messenger, reshaping inhibitory synapses and altering behavior in mice, including reducing anxiety-like responses.","[{""name"":""Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Inserm"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02vjkv261"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-14-CE13-0032;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQU202203014844;""},{""name"":""Fondation Française pour la Recherche sur l'Epilepsie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ligue Française contre l’Epilepsie"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau / Rotary ‘Espoir en tête’"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

While its developmental role is well established, its functions in peripheral T-cell responses remain poorly defined.

LCK-deficient T cells exhibited reduced antigen-induced proliferation but, paradoxically, displayed enhanced effector differentiation in vivo. This phenotype likely reflects dysregulation of specific TCR signaling pathways, as LCK was more critical for ERK and NFAT activation than for NF{kappa}B, AP-1, or AKT/mTOR signaling. T cells deficient in a related kinase FYN also showed a slight increase in effector cell formation, suggesting that effector differentiation is regulated by their combined activity rather than distinct non-redundant roles. Our results reveal that LCK has two intrinsic roles in T-cell responses - promoting proliferation while restraining effector differentiation.

We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue.

Our results suggest that CPD offers a versatile route for preparing tissue for subcellular and ultrastructural-resolution X-ray imaging.

To reveal how these processes are mechanistically linked, we combined acute molecule perturbations in live cells with correlative 3D electron tomography or MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy. We show that degrading Nup62 during mitosis arrests NPC assembly at an intermediate step with smaller membrane pores and removes the whole central transport channel. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that 32 copies of the central channel subcomplex, recruited into the previously unoccupied pore center, can self-associate via hydrophobic interactions to occupy the volume required for full pore size and exert an outward pushing force; indeed, disrupting these interactions during NPC assembly blocked pore dilation. Later in mitotic exit, perturbed cells exhibited impaired nuclear import, smaller nuclei, and looser NE spacing. Acute inhibition of nuclear import recapitulated these NE defects without affecting NPC assembly. Together, our findings reveal a new, two-step molecular mechanism linking NPC assembly and NE reformation. First, hydrophobic FG-nucleoporins dilate the assembling nuclear pore to its full width by forming the central transport channel, which then allows nuclear import-driven nuclear expansion leading to tight, regular NE membrane spacing.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project-ID 511488495 - SFB 1638, P06;""},{""name"":""Baden-Württemberg Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH/NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM083960;P41GM109824;R01GM112108;F32GM150243;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tx8dq56"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757714864018

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.
