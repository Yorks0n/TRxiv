Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.

One Sentence SummarySingle neurons in human temporal cortex use feature axes to encode objects, and imagery reactivates this code.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Yet, shape has been largely overlooked in state transitions studies. Here, we combine morphometric analysis with theoretical modeling and molecular perturbations to interrogate cell shape dynamics during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using stochastic inference, we extract the morphogenetic landscape underlying EMT. We show that within this landscape, EMT-associated cell spreading reflects a transition between shape attractors. Strikingly, we observe a peak in cell shape noise strength concomitant with spreading, and show that higher shape noise accelerates transitions between shape attractors. Our analysis framework will be widely applicable to quantitative cell shape investigations in physiology and disease. Together, our results identify a key role for cellular stochasticity as a regulator of shape change rates, and highlight that shape dynamics yield rich phenotypic information that enhance our understanding of cellular states.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Various neurological conditions and neurodegenerative diseases benefit from small molecules capable of BBB penetration (BBBP) to elicit a therapeutic effect. Predicting BBBP often involves in silico assessment of molecular properties such as lipophilicity (logP) and polar surface area (PSA) using the CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) method. This study curated an open-source dataset to benchmark rigorously machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, attentive GNNs correctly classify these with AURPC, AUROC, and MCC metrics comparable to or better than those of MPO on less difficult test molecules. These findings suggest that integrating attentive GNN models into pharmaceutical drug discovery processes can substantially improve prediction rates, and thereby reduce the timeline, cost, and increase probability of success of designing brain penetrant therapeutics for the treatment of a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Two primary mechanisms of cell elimination have been identified in cell competition studies: contact-dependent cell death and mechanical compression-driven apoptosis. While both occur in tissues, their combined impact on population dynamics is unclear. Here we develop a cell-based computational model to study competition between two cell types with differing physical properties. The model integrates cellular mechanics with cell-cycle dynamics, contact-induced apoptosis, and cell extrusion via mechanical stress. Using this model, we explored how differences in physical traits between cell types influence competitive interactions. Our findings show that differences in cell compressibility alone can drive mechanical competition, with stiffer cells outcompeting softer ones in otherwise identical populations. Surprisingly, mutations that reduce cell stiffness, combined with decreased contact inhibition of proliferation, can create a ""soft"" super-competitive mutant. We demonstrate that changes in apoptosis sensitivity, cell adhesion, and cell size significantly affect growth potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, mutant cell colonies require a critical colony size, dependent on cell compressibility, to overtake the surrounding wild-type tissue. For colonies below the critical size, the elimination process is stochastic, driven by a protrusive finger-like instability in the interface between two cells that promote invasion of the supercompetitors.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Accessory genes encoded in the diversity hotspots are involved in anti-MGE defence and counter-defence, virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), thus playing key roles in interactions amongst phages, MGEs, bacteria and eukaryotic hosts. To date the majority of research has been focused on either individual hotspots or on relatively limited sets of hotspots in a small set of genomes, typically from a single species. A global understanding of hotspot diversity and dynamics still lacking. To address this gap, we developed iLund4u, an algorithm for the systematic annotation of hotspots across millions of sequences. Using a proteome composition approach, iLund4u detects proteome communities, annotates accessory proteins and identifies hotspots. By analysing 873K phage genomes and 696K plasmid sequences we identified 13.7K hotspots and 171K diverse protein families encoded there as cargo. Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database. In the protein search mode iLund4u identifies all hotspots that encode homologues of a query protein. In the proteome annotation mode iLund4u annotates hotspots by searching for communities of similar proteomes.

Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes (""tonic"" or ""phasic""), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

This is however complicated by the highly repetitive nature of these sequences in genomes, requiring the deployment of several problem-specific tools as well as the curation of appropriate genome annotations. This pipeline aims to make the analysis of TE sequences and their expression more generally accessible. Results: The TE-Seq pipeline conducts an end-to-end analysis of RNA sequencing data, examining both genes and TEs. It implements the most current computational methods tailor-made for TEs, and produces a comprehensive analysis of TE expression at both the level of the individual element and at the TE clade level. Furthermore, if supplied with long-read DNA sequencing data, it is able to assess TE expression from non-reference (polymorphic) loci. As a demonstration, we analyzed proliferating, early senescent, and late senescent lung fibroblast RNA-Seq data, and created a custom reference genome and annotations for this cell strain using Nanopore sequencing data. We found that several retrotransposable element (RTE) clades were upregulated in senescence, which included non-reference, intact, and potentially active elements. Availability and implementation: TE-Seq is made available as a Snakemake pipeline which can be obtained at https://github.com/maxfieldk/TE-Seq.

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland. We demonstrate that the success of this ectothermic predator is likely tied to a willingness to use human features of the landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

We previously identified Gmnc as a critical fate determinant for P73+ CRs subtypes from the hem, septum and thalamic eminence. In Gmnc-/- mutants, P73+ CRs are initially produced, cover the telencephalic vesicle but undergo massive apoptosis resulting in their complete depletion at mid-corticogenesis. Here we investigated the consequence of such a CRs depletion on dorsal cortex lamination and hippocampal morphogenesis. We found preplate splitting occurs normally in Gmnc-/- mutants but is followed by defective radial migration arrest in the dorsal cortex, altered cellular organization in the lateral cortex, aberrant hippocampal progenitor proliferation resulting in abnormal CA1 folding and lack of vasculature development in the hippocampal fissure. We then performed conditional Reln deletion in P73+ CRs to evaluate its relative contribution and found that only radial migration defects were recapitulated. We concluded that at mid-corticogenesis, CRs-derived Reln is required for radial migration arrest and additionally identified Reln-independent functions for CRs in the control of hippocampal progenitor proliferation and vessel remodelling.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

A better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms could help future development of adjunctive therapies, yet limitations in current experimental models have hindered our knowledge of the disease. We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability. These findings provide key insights into the parasite-mediated mechanisms driving brain microvascular pathogenesis in cerebral malaria.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

For routine cell type identification, even randomly chosen features can perform well, but for cell type differences that are subtle, both number of features and selection strategy can matter strongly. Here we present a simple feature selection method grounded in an analytical model that, without resorting to arbitrary thresholds or user-defined parameters, allows for interpretable delineation of both how many and which features to choose, facilitating identification of biologically meaningful rare cell types. We compare this method to default methods in scanpy and Seurat, as well as SCTransform, showing how greater accuracy can often be achieved with surprisingly few, well-chosen features.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

We identify dozens of novel lysosomal proteins and reveal the diversity of the lysosomal composition across brain cell types. Notably, we discovered SLC45A1, mutations in which cause a monogenic neurological disease, as a neuron-specific lysosomal protein. Loss of SLC45A1 causes lysosomal dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC45A1 plays a dual role in lysosomal sugar transport and stabilization of V1 subunits of the V-ATPase. SLC45A1 deficiency depletes the V1 subunits, elevates lysosomal pH, and disrupts iron homeostasis causing mitochondrial dysfunction.

To achieve these for diploid and even polyploid genomes, the contemporary approach involves a combination of two long-read sequencing technologies: high-accuracy long reads, e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore (ONT) 'Duplex' reads, and ultra-long ONT 'Simplex' reads. Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species. These results provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of genome sequencing and use corrected ONT reads to analyze more complex genomes with different levels of ploidy or even aneuploidy.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

The bat wing is characterized by an extreme elongation of the second to fifth digits and a wing membrane called chiropatagium connecting them. Here we investigated the developmental and cellular origin of this structure by comparing bat and mouse limbs using omics tools and single-cell analyses. Despite the substantial morphological differences between the species, we observed an overall conservation of cell populations and gene expression patterns including interdigital apoptosis. Single-cell analyses of micro-dissected embryonic chiropatagium identified a specific fibroblast population, independent of apoptosis-associated interdigital cells, as the origin of this tissue. These distal cells express a conserved gene program including the transcription factors MEIS2 and TBX3, which are commonly known to specify and pattern the early proximal limb. Transgenic ectopic expression of MEIS2 and TBX3 in mouse distal limb cells resulted in the activation of genes expressed during wing development and phenotypic changes related to wing morphology, such as the fusion of digits. Our results elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms of bat wing development and illustrate how drastic morphological changes can be achieved through repurposing of existing developmental programs during evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

This interest has rapidly extended to clinical work, with many reports investigating aperiodic activity from patients from a broad range of clinical disorders. This work typically seeks to evaluate aperiodic activity as a putative biomarker relating to diagnosis or treatment response, and/or as a potential marker of underlying physiological activity. There is thus far no clear consensus on if and how aperiodic neural activity relates to clinical disorders, nor on the best practices for how to study it in clinical research. To address this, this systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, examines reports of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological recordings with human patients with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, finding 143 reports across 35 distinct disorders. Reports within and across disorders are summarized to evaluate current findings and examine what can be learned as pertains to the analysis, interpretations, and overall utility of aperiodic neural activity in clinical investigations. Aperiodic activity is commonly reported to relate to clinical diagnoses, with 31 of 35 disorders reporting a significant effect in diagnostic and/or treatment related studies. However, there is variation in the consistency of results across disorders, with the heterogeneity of patient groups, disease etiologies, and treatment status arising as common themes across different disorders. Overall, the current variability of results, potentially confounding covariates, and limitations in current understanding of aperiodic activity suggests further work is needed before aperiodic activity can be established as a potential biomarker and/or marker of underlying pathological physiology. Finally, a series of recommendations are proposed, based on the findings, limitations, and key discussion topics of the current literature to assist with guiding productive future work on the clinical utility of studying aperiodic neural activity.

Host-pathogen co-evolution can cause rapid diversification or loss of pathogen genes encoding host-exposed proteins. The molecular mechanisms that underpin such sequence dynamics remains poorly investigated at the scale of entire pathogen species. Here, we focus on AvrStb6, a major effector of the global wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, evolving in response to the cognate receptor Stb6, a resistance widely deployed in wheat. We comprehensively captured effector gene evolution by analyzing a global thousand-genome panel using reference-free sequence analyses. We found that AvrStb6 has diversified into 59 protein isoforms with a strong association to the pathogen spreading to new continents. Across Europe, we found the strongest differentiation of the effector consistent with high rates of Stb6 deployment. The AvrStb6 locus showed also a remarkable diversification in transposable element content with specific expansion patterns across the globe. We detected the AvrStb6 gene losses and evidence for transposable element-mediated disruptions. We used genome-wide association mapping data to predict virulence emergence and found marked increases in Europe, followed by spread to subsequently colonized continents. Finally, we genotyped French bread wheat cultivars for Stb6 and monitored resistant cultivar deployment concomitant with AvrStb6 evolution. Taken together, our data provides a comprehensive view of how a rapidly diversifying effector locus can undergo large-scale sequence changes concomitant with gains in virulence on resistant cultivars. The analyses highlight also the need for large-scale pathogen sequencing panels to assess the durability of resistance genes and improve the sustainability of deployment strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

We purified the minimal replication complex, comprising nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, and combined it with fluorescently labelled RNA substrates, enabling real-time monitoring of RNA primer elongation at the single-molecule level. This platform allowed us to investigate the mechanisms of action of key inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Antibiotics are known gut microbiota disruptors, but their long-term consequences on taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome remain underexplored.

MO_SCPLOWETHODSC_SCPLOWWe investigated associations between register-based oral antibiotic use over 8 years and gut microbiota composition assessed with fecal shotgun metagenomics in 15,131 adults from the Swedish population-based studies SCAPIS, MOS, and SIMPLER. We applied multivariable regression models with the number of prescriptions in three pre-specified periods before fecal sampling (<1 year, 1-4, 4-8 years) as the main exposures and adjusted for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and comorbidities. Secondary analyses included participants with only one antibiotic course or none.

RO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWAntibiotic use <1 year before fecal sampling was associated with the greatest reduction in gut microbiota species diversity; however, antibiotic use 1-4 years and 4-8 years earlier was also associated with decreased diversity. Clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and flucloxacillin accounted for most of the associations between antibiotic use and the abundance of individual species across all periods. Use of these three antibiotics 4-8 years earlier was associated with altered abundance of 10-14% of the species studied; use of penicillin V, extended-spectrum penicillins, and nitrofurantoin were associated with altered abundance of only a few species. Similar results were found when comparing one antibiotic course 4-8 years before sampling vs. none in the past 8 years.

CONCLUSIONCommonly prescribed antibiotics like clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and the narrow-spectrum flucloxacillin appear to have long-lasting consequences for the gut microbiota.","NA","medrxiv",1729202965517

We identified a novel group of Tn7-like transposons in Cyanobacteria that preferentially target CRISPR arrays, suggesting a new functional interaction between these elements and CRISPR-Cas systems. Using bioinformatics tools, we characterized their phylogeny, target specificity, and sub-specialization. The array-targeting elements are phylogenetically close to tRNA-targeting elements. The distinct target preference coincides with loss of a C-terminal region in the TnsD protein which is responsible for recognizing target sites when compared to closely related elements. Notably, elements are found integrated into a fixed position within CRISPR spacer regions, a behavior that might minimize negative impacts on the host defense system. These transposons were identified in both plasmid and genomic CRISPR arrays, indicating that their preferred target provides a means for both safe insertion in the host chromosome and a mechanism for dissemination. Attempts to reconstitute these elements in E. coli were unsuccessful, indicating possible dependence on native host factors.

Notably, rare pathogenic variants in telomere-related genes are associated with poorer clinical outcomes in these patients. Here we assessed whether rare qualifying variants (QVs) in monogenic adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis (PF) genes are associated with IPF survival. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), we also evaluated the influence of common IPF risk variants in individuals carrying these QVs.

MethodsWe identified QVs in telomere and non-telomere genes linked to monogenic PF forms using whole-genome sequences (WGS) from 888 Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry (PFFPR) individuals. We also derived a PRS for IPF (PRS-IPF) from 19 previously published common sentinel IPF variants. Using regression models, we then examined the mutual relationships of QVs and PRS-IPF and their association with survival. Validation of results was sought in WGS from an independent IPF study (PROFILE, n=472), and results from the two cohorts were meta-analyzed.

ResultsCarriers of QVs in monogenic adult-onset PF genes, representing nearly 1 out of 6 IPF patients, were associated with lower PRS-IPF (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.79; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.15-2.81; p=0.010) and shorter survival (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.12-2.10; p=7.3x10-3). Notably, carriers of pathogenic variants at telomere genes showed the strongest association with survival (HR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.13-2.76; p=0.013). The meta-analysis of the results showed a consistent direction of effect across both cohorts.

ConclusionsWe revealed the opposite effects of QVs and PRS-IPF on IPF survival. Thus, a distinct IPF molecular subtype might be defined by QVs in monogenic adult-onset PF genes. Assessing the carrier status for QVs and modelling PRS-IPF promises to further contribute to predicting disease progression among IPF patients.","NA","medrxiv",1729202965517

In this study, we developed fluorescent reporter plasmids to investigate TBDT promoter activity. Initially, we characterized their promoter activity in commonly used laboratory conditions, revealing diverse expression patterns among all TBDTs. Subsequently, we classified the TBDTs into distinct metal-responsive groups based on their stress-responsive behaviour, shedding light on their functional roles. Additionally, we show that these reporter constructs can be used as a powerful tool for siderophore detection.

Also, GFPs serve as fluorescent tags in size-exclusion chromatography and native-PAGE, facilitating the evaluation of expression levels and quality of the expressed fusion proteins. However, the fluorescent detection of GFPs is generally incompatible with denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), where the samples are heat-denatured before loading. Accordingly, detecting GFP-fused proteins after SDS-PAGE usually relies on western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies. To enable in-gel fluorescence detection of SDS-PAGE-separated GFPs, some protocols employ mild denaturing conditions to keep the GFPs intact. However, such mild denaturation sometimes results in partial denaturation of the proteins and irregular electrophoretic mobility that is not proportional to their molecular weights. Here, we demonstrate that the fully denatured GFPs can be refolded within the gel by cyclodextrin-mediated removal of SDS in the presence of 20% methanol, enabling the in-gel fluorescence detection of the GFP-fused proteins. The protocol is compatible with subsequent total protein staining and western blotting. Although future studies are needed to clarify the scope and generality, the technique developed here would provide a simple, time- and cost-effective alternative to the immunodetection of GFPs.

In the dIPN, we characterise in detail the inputs and outputs of r1{pi} neurons, which have been recently identified as representing the animals heading direction. In the vIPN, we identify six distinct glomerular structures, each exhibiting specific patterns of reciprocal connections and projection pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that the connectivity and spontaneous activity patterns of habenular axons are shaped by the local anatomical features of the IPN, suggesting a role for the local interneurons in modulating presynaptic dynamics.

It is used to treat multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanistic understanding of the effect of this highly effective therapy on B cells and plasma cells in the central nervous system compartment is limited.

ObjectivesThe CLADRIPLAS study examined the effect of cladribine on peripheral and intrathecal B and plasma cell biology in people with MS.

MethodsThirty-eight people with progressive MS ineligible for- or rejecting-treatment with licenced therapies were recruited and supplied a baseline lumbar puncture. Those exhibiting gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions and/or elevated neurofilament levels were offered subcutaneous cladribine (Litak(R)). Seven people were eligible; one person died before treatment, and only five completed the first year of treatment. Twenty-two ineligible people were willing to provide a repeat lumbar puncture twelve months later.

ResultsThe CLADRIPLAS study found no evidence of a difference in the odds of a positive cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band (cOCB) result between the cladribine-treated and untreated group. This is probably explained by microarray and in vitro studies, which demonstrated that plasmablasts and notably long-lived plasma cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cladribine compared to memory B cells at physiological concentrations. This was consistent with the loss of intracellular deoxycytidine kinase during antibody-secreting cell differentiation.

DiscussionCLADRIPLAS indicates that cOCB are not rapidly eliminated in most people with MS. This may be explained by the relative lack of direct cytotoxic action of cladribine on long-lived plasma cells.","NA","medrxiv",1729202965517

To remedy this, we present open-data, large-scale, and varied morphological evidence that Xenopus laevis embryo development is accelerated in a well-engineered, environmentally-calibrated hypomagnetic field of less than 1 nT. These data imply that basal tadpole physiology can sense and react to the absence of Earths minute magnetic field of approximately 50 {micro}T. The effect is significant, as demonstrated by a variety of statistical measures. As no definitive biophysical mechanism has been identified to account for its occurrence, this study raises the question of which mechanism provides the most plausible explanation. How that question is answered may have implications in a variety of fields, including human health, behavioral ecology, and space exploration.

1. SummaryThe biological effects of weak magnetic fields, such as Earths geomagnetic field ([~] 50 {micro}T), have long been reported, but remain poorly understood and met with skepticism [1, 2]. This scientific stalemate is due both to the absence of a definitive biophysical mechanism to explain such effects, and to experimental shortcomings. First, the rationale has been that the biological effects of weak magnetic fields are negligible because the field strengths are thought to be too small to trigger a biophysical sensing mechanism. Second, large-scale, thoroughly environmentally controlled data are lacking, and existing results are often ambiguous regarding whether the effects are truly attributable to magnetic fields or other environmental factors. However, the reality of a given effect can be established absent a known mechanism with a sufficiently well-designed experiment. Here, we demonstrate that the development of Xenopus laevis embryos is significantly accelerated when they are raised in a hypomagnetic environment (< 1 nT) shielded from Earths geomagnetic field. Our large-scale dataset and analysis code are publicly available. After extensive calibration of environmental conditions, our assessment is that the origin of the effects is the absence of Earths magnetic field. Our main finding is thus that the basal physiology of a non-migratory species like Xenopus laevis significantly reacts to a magnetic shift on the order of 50 {micro}T, with effects observed as early as one day post-fertilization. These results are sufficiently robust to advance the scientific consensus that weak magnetic fields indeed exert measurable biological effects. We also raise the question of which underlying mechanism could best explain our observations. Answering this could have far-reaching implications across fields such as human health, behavioral ecology, and space exploration.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

The vascular pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) enters through hydathodes, organs at the leaf margin involved in guttation. Subsequently, Xcc breaks out from infected hydathodes, progressing into the xylem vessels and causing systemic disease. To elucidate the mechanisms that underpin the different stages of Xcc pathogenesis, a need exists to image Xcc progression in planta in a non-invasive manner. Here, we describe a phenotyping setup and Python image analysis pipeline capturing the Xcc infection in 16 Arabidopsis thaliana plants in parallel over time. The setup used both an RGB to capture disease symptoms and an ultra-sensitive CCD camera to monitor bacterial progression inside the leaves using bioluminescence. We demonstrate that the image analysis pipeline reliably quantifies bacterial growth in planta for two bacterial species, that is vascular Xcc and the mesophyll pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. The resolution of the camera allowed early detection of Xcc in the hydathodes, yielding valuable information on this early stage of the Xcc infection process. The data obtained through the automated image analysis pipeline was robust and validated findings from other bioluminescence imaging methods, while requiring fewer samples. We can thus quantify the resistance level of a large number of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and mutant lines to different bacterial strains in a non-invasive manner for phenotypic screenings.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

To address these questions, we employed advanced phylogenomic approaches and comprehensive datasets spanning the known diversity of cellular life and viruses. Our analysis provided an updated reconstruction of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) proteome, in which we traced the phylogenetic origin of each protein family. We found compelling evidence for multiple waves of horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacterial and viral donors, with some likely preceding the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We inferred the proteomes of the potential major donors and their functional contributions to LECA. Our findings underscore the contribution of horizontal gene transfers in shaping the proteomes of pre-LECA ancestors and hint to a facilitating role of Nucleocytoviricota viruses. Altogether, our results suggest ancient eukaryotes originated within complex microbial ecosystems through a succession of symbiotic interactions that left a footprint of horizontally transferred genes.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

To sustain this complex system, dolphins rely on a rich vocal repertoire: clicks exclusively used for echolocation, burst-pulse sounds associated with emotions during social interactions, and whistles, including signature whistles that serve as individual-specific identifiers (names). How dolphins maintain their complex social structure based only on a limited repertoire of sounds remains elusive. Previous studies suggest that contextual information can be transferred by the modulation of the whistles. Here, we investigated the whistle variability using a comprehensive computational approach, and studied the structure of the interactions between the whistle variants. Using a unique large dataset, acquired in a natural environment, we observed that signature whistles exhibit variations in their frequency contours. Unsupervised clustering revealed that signature whistles could be classified into sub-categories (signature whistle variants). The existence of these categories, and their independence on the emitter dolphin, indicate that these variations are not random. Analysis of pairwise interactions between sub-categories revealed a clustered structure similar to that of their social hierarchy. Network analysis of this structure showed that whistle sub-categories had different functional roles: some acted as hubs, others as bridges, and certain were used for turn-taking between the main whistle categories. We also found that the dolphins emit signature whistles of their deceased mothers, a phenomenon only observed in human language.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

NMDARs exist as multiple subtypes that differ in their subunit composition, distribution and signaling properties, with GluN1/GluN2A (GluN2A diheteromers), GluN1/GluN2B (GluN2B diheteromers) and GluN1/2A/2B (GluN2A/2B triheteromers) receptors prevailing. Studying these subtypes separately has proved difficult due to the limited specificity of available pharmacological and genetic approaches. Here, we designed a photoswitchable tool (Opto2B) enabling specific and reversible modulation of GluN2B diheteromers (while other receptor subtypes remain unaffected). Using Opto2B, we were able to establish the differential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers relative to GluN2A-receptors (GluN2A diheteromers and GluN2A/2B triheteromers) to synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDAR pools. In young postnatal CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, extrasynaptic NMDARs are exclusively composed of GluN2B diheteromers, whereas GluN2A subunits already populate synaptic sites. In adult CA1 cells, GluN2A-receptors predominate at both sites, with no preferential contribution of GluN2B diheteromers to extrasynaptic currents. Our study clarifies decades of controversial research and paves the way for interrogating NMDAR signaling diversity with unprecedented molecular and spatio-temporal resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

When effector cells attempt to suppress the tumour, the cancer cells can respond in kind by evolving methods of escape or inhibition. Knowledge of this coevolutionary system and the selection taking place within it can help us understand tumour-immune dynamics both during tumorigenesis but also when treatments such as immunotherapies are applied. Here, we present an individual-based branching process model of mutation accumulation, where random mutations arising in cancer cells trigger corresponding specialised immune responses. Different from previous research, we explicitly model interactions between cancer and effector cells, while incorporating stochastic effects, which are especially important for the expansion and extinction of small populations. We find that the parameters governing interactions between the cancer and effector cells induce different outcomes of tumour progress, such as suppression and evasion. While it is hard to measure the cancer-immune dynamics directly in patients, genetic information of the cancer may indicate the presence of such interactions. Our model demonstrates signatures of selection in sequencing-derived summary statistics, such as the single-cell mutational burden. Thus, bulk and single-cell sequencing of a tumour may give information about the coevolutionary dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in Acanthamoeba castellanii from a composting soil sample in Jyvaskyla, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses, including conserved Nucleocytoviricota genes, histone-like genes, and three unique ORFans. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus lifecycle, such as single virions attached to the cell membrane, likely triggering endocytosis, and virus-rich vesicle formation within the cytoplasm. We also reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 [A] resolution using cryo-EM. The ~2,500 [A] diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9,240 copies of the major capsid protein ORF184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the twelve vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus, along with other virus-like particles, not only suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment but also provide insights extendable to other marseilleviruses, addressing the previously lacking structural data on minor capsid proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

This study provides the first cellular characterization of FAM30A focussing on an internal tandemly organised region, referred to as FAM30A repeats. FAM30A levels correlated with canonical AML LSC signatures and FAM30A depletion decreased cell viability as well as increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutics. It also inhibited colony formation, promoted granulocytic differentiation and abrogated leukemic engraftment in murine bone marrow in vivo. Overexpression of FAM30A repeats in this setting enhanced stemness, proliferation, chemoresistance, and engraftment thus highlighting the biological relevance of this region for LSC biology. On the molecular level, FAM30A repeats interact with the pro-LSC regulator Musashi-2 (MSI2), positively influencing expression of its targets including RUNX1 isoforms. We herein uncover that this FAM30A-MSI2-RUNX1 regulatory loop is of potential relevance for LSC maintenance in AML. These findings provide valuable insights into FAM30A's cellular role and highlight its targeting potential for eliminating LSCs and improving treatment outcomes in AML patients.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells recognizing WT spike in two individuals of mRNA vaccine, from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection. Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 g/ml. Structural and functional analysis further suggests that IGHV3-74 mAbs target a novel epitope on receptor-binding domain and the best mAb, termed KXD352, is highly resilient to variations on this epitope. Overall, this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mRNA vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated Omicron infections.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Although predicting protein structures by fold recognition algorithms has become increasingly powerful, especially with the integration of deep-learning approaches, experimentally resolved structures are indispensable for guiding structure-function studies and for improving modelling. However, experimental structural studies of protein complexes are still challenging, owing to, for example, the necessity for high protein concentrations and purity for downstream analyses such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The use of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves as a transient expression system for recombinant proteins has become an increasingly attractive approach as the plant is inexpensive to cultivate, grows rapidly, allows fast experimental turnaround and is easily scalable compared to other established systems such as insect cell cultures. Using N. benthamiana as an expression system, we present here a robust and versatile protocol for the purification of five heterocomplexes with sizes ranging from [~]140 kDa to [~]660 kDa consisting of immunoreceptors and their associated pathogen effectors, followed by electron microscopy. The plant-based protocol was applied to verify the structure of the insect cell-derived wheat Sr35 resistosome and to co-purify and co-resolve a [~]140 kDa homodimer of the AvrSr35 effector from the fungus Puccinia graminis f sp tritici (Pgt). In several cases, only a single epitope tag is needed for complex purification, reducing complications that come with multiple epitope tags and two-step affinity purifications. We identify codon usage, signal peptide fusion, epitope tag choice and detergents as critical factors for expression and purification of recombinant protein from N. benthamiana leaves.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

The emergence of new cases in non-endemic areas highlights the importance of early pathogen detection in vectors and reservoirs to generate effective control strategies and establish preventive policies. The objective of this study was to design and validate a detection system of T. cruzi based on specific DNA cleavage and collateral activation using the CRISPR/LbCas12a system, targeting the genes Cytochrome B (Cytb), 18S ribosomal subunit (SR18s), and histone (H2A). This system was validated for their uses in both vectors and reservoirs of the parasite. The first step was to conduct a bioinformatic analysis of the target genes and design RNA guides for each cleavage site and primers to amplify the target region through PCR. Subsequently, we sequenced the amplified DNA target and validated the detection system using T. cruzi DNA extracted from naturally infected Rhodnius pallescens in the metropolitan area of Bucaramanga, Colombia. After standardizing the method, we tested the CRISPR/Cas system with Silvio X10/4 laboratory strain of T. cruzi and scaled up to blood samples of naturally infected Didelphis marsupialis. As a result, we observed the DNA cleavage employing the CRISPR/Cas system with Cytb guide with a sensitivity of up to 0.0475 ng/uL of provided DNA. Sequencing of the Cytb gene showed no mutations in the cleavage site. However, point mutations and indels were found in SR18S and H2A, avoiding the formation of the CRISPR/LbCas12 complex. Furthermore, we introduce the design of a fluorescent detection prototype with CRISPR/LbCas12a called Tropical Diseases Detector (TropD-Detector). This device operates with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm emitted by an LED and a high-pass light filter with a cutoff wavelength of 500 nm.

The TropD-Detector provides a visual, viable, and sensitive method for detecting T. cruzi in both vectors and reservoirs from endemic areas.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

There is a dire need for tools and formats enabling pangenomic annotation to facilitate such enrichment of pangenomic references. The Graph Alignment Format (GAF) is a text format, tab-delimited like BED/VCF files, which was proposed to represent alignments. GAF could also be used to store paths representing annotations in a pangenome graph, but there are no tools to index and query them efficiently. Here, we present extensions to vg and HTSlib that provide efficient sorting, indexing, and querying for GAF files. With this approach, annotations overlapping a subgraph can be extracted quickly. Paths are sorted based on the IDs of traversed nodes, compressed with BGZIP, and indexed with HTSlib/tabix via our extensions for the GAF format. Compared to the binary GAM format, GAF files are easier to edit or inspect because they are plain text, and we show that they are twice as fast to sort and half as large on disk. In addition, we updated vg annotate, which takes BED or GFF3 annotation files relative to linear sequences and projects them into the pangenome. It can now produce GAF files representing these annotations' paths through the pangenome. We showcase these new tools on several applications. We projected annotations for all Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Year 1 haplotypes, including genes, segmental duplications, tandem repeats and repeats annotations, into the Minigraph-Cactus pangenome (GRCh38-based v1.1).

Here we address these issues by network-based analysis of single cell transcriptomic profiles of pathophysiologically relevant human adult basal, ciliated and secretory cells to identify master regulator (MR) protein modules controlling their SARS-CoV-2-mediated reprogramming. This uncovered chromatin remodeling, endosomal sorting, ubiquitin pathway as well as proviral factors identified by CRISPR analyses as components of the host response collectively or selectively activated in these cells.

It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

We extend single-cell imaging methods to capture complete biofilm development, characterizing the stages of biofilm development and visualizing eDNA matrix morphogenesis. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of single cell lysis events reveals that cell lysis is restricted to a specific biofilm zone.

By applying an optimized sample preparation workflow and experimental conditions, we were able to obtain 19F-SSNMR spectra for both antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes with sensitivity and line widths closely comparable to those achieved using solution NMR. This facilitated a direct comparison of the A2AAR conformational equilibria across detergent micelle, lipid nanodisc, and lipid vesicle preparations. While antagonist-bound A2AAR showed a similar conformational equilibria across all membrane and membrane mimetic systems, the conformational equilibria of agonist-bound A2AAR exhibited differences among different environments. This suggests that the conformational equilibria of GPCRs may be influenced not only by specific receptor-lipid interactions but also by the membrane properties found in larger lipid assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum (MS2), often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFragger's fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each MS2, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition (WWA) data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides. Coupled with the FragPipe platform, MSFragger-DDA+ enables more comprehensive and accurate analysis of proteomics data.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Under stress conditions, growth is usually attenuated in favor of stress response, creating a trade-off between growth and stress. Autophagy is a vital process in eukaryotes, maintaining cellular balance by degrading and recycling cellular components. It is triggered by various nutrient-deprivation conditions and both biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Surprisingly, over-expressing autophagy-related genes across multiple plant species resulted in increased plant size, yield, and stress resistance, posing autophagy as a regulator of the stress-growth balance. Yet, the molecular mechanisms governing its induction remain partially understood.

In the current work, we identified raffinose-a plant-derived sugar known for its role in stress responses-as a novel plant autophagy inducer. Raffinose treatment resulted in increased biomass and yield in an autophagy-dependent manner in several plant species. We also show that raffinose activates autophagy through the SnRK1 kinase complex, independent of TOR signaling, and that raffinose treatment results in increased expression of ATG5 and ATG7. We also point to possible downstream candidates operating autophagy-related biomass accumulation. Our findings offer new perspectives on the role of autophagy in maintaining a balance between plant growth and stress responses, underscoring the significance of raffinose in its regulation.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe intricate balance between plant growth and stress responses is crucial for agricultural productivity, particularly as climate change intensifies environmental stressors such as drought and extreme temperatures. Usually, there is a trade-off between growth and stress response. Autophagy--a cellular recycling process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis--plays a pivotal role in this balance. Yet, the molecular mechanisms modulating it are partially understood. Raffinose treatment enhances biomass and yields in various plant species by inducing autophagy. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms of raffinose-mediated autophagy induction, our findings provide valuable insights into potential strategies for enhancing plant resilience against climate-induced stress.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

In rodents, social discrimination relies on memory and recognition of individual-specific cues, known as individual signatures. While olfactory signals are central, other sensory cues - such as auditory, visual, and tactile inputs - also play a role. However, little research has explored the fine discrimination of individuals with overlapping cues, such as siblings or cohabitating mice. This study investigates whether mice can discriminate between two closely related individuals: siblings from the same litter and cage. We tested the hypothesis that it would be more challenging for mice to distinguish between siblings than between unrelated mice due to shared cues. Moreover, social cognitive impairments are common in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), where difficulties in recognizing faces and voices progressively disrupt social interactions in patients. Using a mouse model of AD (Tg2576), known for the progressive onset of cognitive deficits, we assessed whether the ability to discriminate between siblings is preserved in pre-symptomatic animals. Thus, we first demonstrated that male and female C57BL6/J mice can discriminate siblings, regardless of sex. Then, we revealed that pre-symptomatic 3-month-old Tg2576 mice exhibit impairments in subtle social memory, while their general social memory remains unaffected. Hence, we demonstrate that the inability to perform fine social discrimination is an early cognitive impairment that arises before other well-documented memory abnormalities in this AD mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

However, only phosphorylation by CDK12 is stimulated by association with the elongation-specific factor PAF1C, in which the CDC73 subunit contains a short, conserved motif capable of association with and activation of CDK12/Cyclin K.

However, many patients fail to respond, especially those with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), suggesting the existence of additional immune checkpoints that act through orthogonal mechanisms. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec)-7 and -9 are newly designated glycoimmune checkpoints that are abundantly expressed by tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. We discovered that T cells express only basal levels of Siglec transcripts; instead, they acquire Siglec-7 and -9 from interacting myeloid cells in the TME via trogocytosis, which impairs their activation and effector function. Mechanistically, Siglec-7 and -9 suppress T cell activity by dephosphorylating T cell receptor (TCR)-related signaling cascades. Using sulfur fluoride exchange (SuFEx) click chemistry, we developed a ligand that binds to Siglec-7 and -9 with high-affinity and exclusive specificity. Using this ligand, we constructed a Siglec-7/9 degrader that targets membrane Siglec-7 and -9 to the lysosome for degradation. Administration of this degrader induced efficient Siglec degradation in both T cells and myeloid cells in the TME. We found that Siglec-7/9 degradation has a negligible effect on macrophage phagocytosis, but significantly enhances T cell anti-tumor immunity. The degrader, particularly when combined with anti-CTLA-4, enhanced macrophage antigen presentation, reshaped the TME, and resulted in long-lasting T cell memory and excellent tumor control in multiple murine tumor models. These findings underscore the need to consider exogenous checkpoints acquired by T cells in the TME when selecting specific checkpoint blockade therapy to enhance T cell immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Recent work from our lab measured the energetics of base-stacking interactions and suggested that terminal stacking interactions between two adjacent strands could be an additional design parameter for DNA nanotechnology. Here, we explore that idea by creating DNA tetrahedra held together with sticky ends that contain identical base pairing interactions but different terminal stacking interactions. Testing all 16 possible combinations, we found that the melting temperature of DNA tetrahedra varied by up to 10 {degrees}C from altering a single base stack in the design. These results can inform stacking design to control DNA tetrahedra stability in a substantial and predictable way. To that end, we show that a 4 bp sticky end with weak terminal stacking does not form stable tetrahedra, while strengthening the stacks confers high stability with a 46.8 {+/-} 1.2 {degrees}C melting temperature, comparable to a 6 bp sticky end with weak stacking. The results likely apply to other types of DNA nanostructures and suggest that terminal stacking interactions play an integral role in formation and stability of DNA nanostructures.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function(2,3) with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities(4-8). Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Detailed, high-quality observations of when plants undergo seasonal transitions such as leaf-out, flowering, and fruiting are critical for tracking causes and consequences of phenology shifts, but these data are often sparse and biased globally. These data gaps limit broader generalizations and forecasting improvements in the face of continuing disturbance. One solution to closing such gaps is to document phenology on field images taken by public participants. iNaturalist, in particular, provides global scale research-grade data and is expanding rapidly. Here we utilize over 53 million field images of plants and millions of human annotations from iNaturalist - data spanning all angiosperms and drawn from across the globe - to train a computer vision model (PhenoVision) to detect the presence of fruits and flowers. PhenoVision utilizes a vision transformer architecture pretrained with a masked autoencoder to improve classification success, and it achieves high accuracy for flower (98.5%) and fruit presence (95%). Key to producing research-ready phenology data is post-calibration tuning and validation focused on reducing noise inherent in field photographs, and maximizing the true positive rate. We also develop a standardized set of quality metrics and metadata so that results can be used effectively by the community. Finally, we showcase how this effort vastly increases phenology data coverage, including regions of the globe where data have been limited before. Our end products are tuned models, new data resources, and an application streamlining discovery and use of those data for the broader research and management community. We close by discussing next steps, including automating phenology annotations, adding new phenology targets, e.g., leaf phenology, and further integration with other resources to form a global central database integrating all in-situ plant phenology resources.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Combining in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments we show how membrane viscosity and MCA protein length regulate cortical dynamics. We reveal a novel mechanism whereby caging of linker proteins in the actin cortex allows for the amplification of small changes in these key parameters, leading to major alterations of cortical contractility. In cells, this mechanism alone gives rise to symmetry breaking phenomena, suggesting that local changes in lipid composition, in combination with the choice of MCA proteins, contribute to the regulation of cellular morphogenesis and function.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

ResultsOur comprehensive genomic analysis uncovered gene flow from various Mediterranean regions into Iberia before the Islamic period, supporting a pre-existing pan-Mediterranean homogenization phenomenon during the Roman Empire. North African ancestry is present but sporadic in late antiquity genomes but becomes consolidated during the Islamic period. We uncovered one of the earliest dated Islamic burials in Spain, which showed high levels of inbreeding. For the first time we also prove the persistence of North African ancestry in a Christian cemetery until the 17th century, in addition to evidence of slave traffick from the Maghreb.

However, in the absence of DNA methylation due to mutations in the DNA methylation machinery or in certain developmental contexts, the same TEs can gain Polycomb-associated H3K27me3, another epigenetic silencing mark that is usually linked with the facultative silencing of genes. In this study, we initially aimed to investigate whether DNA methylation and H3K27me3 could compete during the establishment of silencing at TEs in the model plant Arabidopsis. Strikingly, we show that the deposition of the H3K27me3 mark at newly inserted transgenic TE sequences is impaired in plants in which the de novo DNA methyltransferase DRM2 is mutated, contrary to the competition model hypothesized. Further profiling of H3K27me3 in drm2 mutants and in the DNA demethylase mutant rdd confirmed this new role of DNA methylation in promoting H3K27me3 deposition at some TEs, in addition to the previously described antagonistic role at others. These findings further reveal a new function of DNA demethylation in modulating H3K27me3 levels in vegetative tissues, which we confirmed via targeted DNA methylation experiments. Together, our results uncover a novel crosstalk between DNA methylation and Polycomb at TEs and reveal that these two pathways, thought to be specialized and antagonistic, can be interdependent and cooperate more than anticipated to maintain genome and epigenome integrity in eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

One approach to this problem has been to test specific hypotheses on the relevance of a visual property (e.g. orientation or color), build a set of ""artificial"" stimuli that vary along that property and then record neural responses to those stimuli. Here, we present a complementary, data-driven method to retrieve the tuning properties of visual neurons. Exploiting deep generative networks and electrophysiology in monkeys, we first used a method to reconstruct any stimulus from its evoked neuronal activity in the inferotemporal cortex (IT). Then, by arbitrarily perturbing the response of individual cortical sites in the model, we generated naturalistic and interpretable sequences of images that strongly influence neural activity of that site. This method enables the discovery of previously unknown tuning properties of high-level visual neurons that are easily interpretable, which we tested with carefully controlled stimuli. When we knew which images drove the neurons, we activated the cells with electrical microstimulation and observed a predicable shift of the monkey perception in the direction of the preferred image. By allowing the brain to tell us what it cares about, we are no longer limited by our experimental imagination.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

For example, the type II secretion system (T2SS) releases toxins, proteases, lipases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes into the extracellular environment to promote tissue softening and soft rot. In this way, the T2SS promotes virulence of phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. However, the role of the T2SS and its substrates for vascular disease remains enigmatic. Here, we show that the Xps-T2SS allows Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) to breach the tissue barrier between hydathodes - the initial bacterial entry point - and xylem thereby gaining access to the leaf vasculature. Yet, Xps-T2SS was dispensable for bacterial multiplication in the leaf apoplast or inside the hydathode cavity suggesting a role beyond plant defense suppression or nutrient acquisition. Using comparative genomics, four plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) were found to be associated with vascular pathogenesis. Testing gene knockout combinations of those enzymes revealed that virulence of only the quadruple CWDE mutant was down to the level of the xps-T2SS mutant.

Work by us and others has shown that the choice of these synonymous codon is not random, and carries regulatory and functional consequences. Existing protein foundation models ignore this context-dependent role of coding sequence in shaping the protein landscape of the cell. To address this gap, we introduce cdsFM, a suite of codon-resolution large language models, including both EnCodon and DeCodon models, with up to 1B parameters. Pre-trained on 60 million protein-coding sequences from more than 5,000 species, our models effectively learn the relationship between codons and amino acids, recapitualing the overall structure of the genetic code. In addition to outperforming state-of-the-art genomic foundation models in a variety of zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, the larger pre-trained models were superior in predicting the choice of synonymous codons. To systematically assess the impact of synonymous codon choices on protein expression and our models ability to capture these effects, we generated a large dataset measuring overall and surface expression levels of three proteins as a function of changes in their synonymous codons. We showed that our EnCodon models could be readily fine-tuned to predict the contextual consequences of synonymous codon choices. Armed with this knowledge, we applied EnCodon to existing clinical datasets of synonymous variants, and we identified a large number of synonymous codons that are likely pathogenic, several of which we experimentally confirmed in a cellbased model. Together, our findings establish the cdsFM suite as a powerful tool for decoding the complex functional grammar underlying the choice of synonymous codons.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

SeqDance is pre-trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from over 30,400 molecular dynamics trajectories and 28,600 normal mode analyses. Our results show that SeqDance effectively captures local dynamic interactions, co-movement patterns, and global conformational features, even for proteins lacking homologs in the pre-training set.

Here, we use the three closely-related species Drosophila sechellia, D. simulans and D. melanogaster to study taste circuit and food choice evolution. D. sechellia, a host specialist, feeds exclusively on a single fruit (Morinda citrifolia, noni) - the latter two are generalists living on various substrates. Using quantitative feeding assays, we recapitulate the preference for noni in D. sechellia and detect conserved sweet but altered bitter sensitivity via calcium imaging in peripheral taste neurons. Noni surprisingly activates bitter sensing neurons more strongly in D. sechellia due to a small deletion in one single gustatory receptor. Using volumetric calcium imaging in the ventral brain, we show that instead of peripheral physiology, species-specific processing of noni and sugar signals in sensorimotor circuits recapitulates differences in dietary preference. Our data support that peripheral receptor changes alone cannot explain altered food choice but rather modifications in how sensory information is transformed into feeding motor commands.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

In this study, we reverse-engineered two natural FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) variants, VrFLS2XL and GmFLS2b, with extended recognition specificities towards evading flg22 variants. We identified minimal gain-of-function residues enabling blind FLS2s to recognize otherwise evading flg22 variants.

Additionally, we leveraged polymorphisms that enhance recognition through unknown mechanisms to engineer superior recognition capability. These findings offer basic design principles for PRRs with broader recognition spectra, paving the way for PRR engineering using precise gene-editing to increase disease resistance in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

High-altitude exposure is typically incorporated in elite sport training regimens, but little is known about how this network adapts to an environment characterised by tissue hypoxia. For this reason, we investigated how high-altitude exposure affects mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure, respiratory control, and intrinsic mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Nine healthy and recreationally active sea-level residents (eight males and one female) resided at an altitude of 3454 m with biopsies collected from the vastus lateralis muscle before and after 7 and 28 days at high altitude. The muscular mitochondrial volume density (MitoVD) increased after high-altitude exposure, driven by an increase in the intermyofibrillar MitoVD. This was however accompanied by a decreased cristae surface area per skeletal muscle fibre volume (MuscularCD) because of a decline in the cristae surface area per mitochondrial volume (MitoCD). Despite a reduced MuscularCD, mass-specific maximal coupled respiration (OXPHOS_CII+CI+ETF) increased slightly, and was considerably elevated when normalised to MuscularCD, suggesting intrinsic adaptations to high altitude. The difference between cristae-specific OXPHOS_CII+CI+ETF and an associated cristae-specific leak respiration (Leak_CII+CI+ETF) indicated a markedly higher degree of coupling between the electron flow in the electron transport system and ATP production. As the effect size 95% confidence intervals includes trivial effects the results need to be substantiated. In conclusion, high-altitude exposure altered mitochondrial subcellular distribution, ultrastructure and induced intrinsic respiratory adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

To distinguish between biological and technical factors contributing to differences between protein and RNA levels, we developed BayesPG, a Bayesian model of transcript and protein abundance that systematically accounts for technical variation and infers biological differences. We use BayesPG to jointly model RNA and protein data collected from 29,709 single cells across different methods and datasets. BayesPG estimated consensus mRNA and protein levels for 3,861 gene products and quantified the relative protein-to-mRNA ratio (rPTR) for each gene across six distinct cell types in samples from human testis. About 28% of the gene products exhibited significant differences at protein and RNA levels and contributed to about 1, 500 significant GO groups. We observe that specialized and context specific functions, such as those related to spermatogenesis are regulated after transcription.

Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypothesis related with their role in cognition.

Author SummaryBrain oscillations, thought to be crucial for many cognitive processes, might actually be waves that travel across the brains surface. Understanding these traveling waves is notoriously difficult because current non-invasive methods like magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG-EEG) face significant technical limitations. To address this challenge, we developed a new approach that combines brain imaging techniques and computational modeling. We focused on the primary visual cortical area (V1) of the brain and created a model that simulates traveling activity across the cortex and predicts how these traveling waves should appear in EEG and MEG recordings. We tested our model by comparing its predictions with brain data collected when participants view visual patterns specifically designed to induce traveling waves in the visual system. The results show that our model accurately captures the direction and pattern of the traveling waves, as well as the specific parameters of the visual stimuli. This novel modeling tool offers a promising method for studying endogenous traveling waves and will enable neuroscientists to explore hypotheses about the spatiotemporal organization of brain activity and its role in cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Accordingly, the perceived value of a reward varies depending on an animals current needs. Updating the specific value of rewards predicted by external cues depends on the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, neurophysiological investigations have centered around the assumption of stimulus-invariant value representations and have not been able to account for behavioral findings that support the BLAs ability to represent stimulus-specific value of distinct appetitive or aversive outcomes. To address how the BLA encodes and updates stimulus-specific value representations, we exposed head-fixed mice to distinct sets of gustatory rewards while tracking perceived value using lick microstructural analysis. Two-photon calcium imaging of BLA principal neurons revealed that the magnitude of the BLA population response scaled with perceived reward value and that the values of different rewards were encoded by distinct neuronal subpopulations. Moreover, reward representations rapidly re-scaled when mice were exposed to a reward that was larger than all previous rewards. Finally, value representations depended on an animals internal state as thirst selectively increased the responses to water rewards whereas aversive experiences strongly attenuated responses to sucrose. Our findings demonstrate that value representations in the BLA are stimulus-specific and highly adaptive to account for changes in relative reward value and to reflect an animals current affective and homeostatic state. This mechanism enables sensory-specific value updates necessary for state-adapted decision making and learning.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

However, most of the ligands described to date lack intra-G4 selectivity, severely limiting their potential for uncovering the biological function of individual G4s across the genome. To overcome these limitations, we developed ATENA (Approach to Target Exact Nucleic Acid alternative structures). ATENA relies on the chemical modification of established G4-ligands to enable their conjugation onto a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) using HaloTag, allowing for the targeting of individual G4s in living cells. We have systematically screened the length of the PEG-linkers connecting the G4-ligands to the HaloTag and sgRNA sequences to attain optimal G4 engagement both in vitro and in cells. Using optimized conditions, we leveraged ATENA to demonstrate how the selective targeting of the well-studied G4 in the promoter of the oncogene c-MYC suppresses its transcription exclusively from the P1 promoter. We also show that positioning ligands in the proximity of regulatory elements suppresses c-MYC transcription in a G4-independent manner, highlighting the importance of appropriate design to measure genuine G4-mediated transcriptional changes. We also demonstrate that selective targeting of a G4 in the PVT1 promoter can either stimulate or repress its transcription depending on the type of G4-ligand used, indicating that functional responses associated with G4-stabilization can highly depend on the type of ligand used. We further harnessed ATENA to study transcriptional perturbation associated with cell-specific G4s, revealing that the functional responses associated with these structures are tightly linked with the expression levels of the targeted gene. Our study provides critical insights into G4-based therapeutic design, offering an innovative platform to investigate G4 biology with high precision.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

In both AD and PD postmortem tissue, neuroinflammation - the activation of microglia and resident macrophages and the infiltration of immune cells from the periphery, including T cells and monocytes-are drivers of neurodegeneration. However, how the co-expression of these pathologies contribute to the inflammatory response and overall neurodegenerative disease phenotype remains unknown. To understand how the co-expression of pathologies drives neuropathology, we developed a novel co-pathology model by stereotaxically injecting -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum, and AAV-doublemut tau virus into the entorhinal cortex, of 3-month-old J20 transgenic mice with A{beta} pathology. We analyzed immune cell populations in the brain and periphery at 3 months post-induction (3MPI). At 6MPI, neuronal loss in the hippocampus and substantia nigra pars compacta were assessed along with pathological protein deposition. At 3MPI, the co-pathology mouse model begins to exhibit enhanced pathology load in the cortex and hippocampus. There was a robust neuroinflammatory response in interconnected brain regions, including increased microglial cell number, changes in microglial activation markers, and infiltration of T cells. This was synergistic in the co-pathology model, compared to the individual models, supporting the hypothesis that these collectively may drive the progression of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Interestingly, CD169+CD11c- ATMs are enriched in a subpopulation of nerve-associated macrophages (NAMs) that declines with age. Depletion of CD169+ NAMs in aged mice increases inflammaging and impairs lipolysis suggesting that they are necessary for preventing catecholamine resistance in VAT. These findings reveal specialized ATMs control adipose homeostasis and link inflammation to tissue dysfunction during aging.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new heuristic algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for ILS by treating it as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, loss, and ILS. Despite being a heuristic method, we show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than leading methods that can model ILS, while also being able to handle much larger datasets. We demonstrate the use of reconcILS by applying it to a dataset of 23 primate genomes, highlighting its accuracy compared to standard methods in the presence of large amounts of ILS.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Though many studies have uncovered significant molecular distinctions between astrocytes from different brain regions, how this regionalization unfolds over development is not fully understood. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular diversity of brain cells across six developmental stages and four brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. Our analysis of over 170,000 single astrocyte nuclei revealed striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between telencephalic and diencephalic regions, at all developmental time points surveyed in both species. At the stages sampled, most of the region patterning was private to astrocytes and not shared with neurons or other glial types. Though astrocytes were already regionally patterned in late embryonic stages, this region-specific astrocyte gene expression signature changed dramatically over postnatal development, and its composition suggests that regional astrocytes further specialize postnatally to support their local neuronal circuits. Comparing across species, we found divergence in the expression of astrocytic region- and age-differentially expressed genes and the timing of astrocyte maturation relative to birth between mouse and marmoset, as well as hundreds of species differentially expressed genes. Finally, we used expansion microscopy to show that astrocyte morphology is largely conserved across gray matter forebrain regions in the mouse, despite substantial molecular divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Absence of a diagnosis creates uncertainty around recurrence after transplantation, familial risk, and participation in therapeutic trials. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to identify genetic variants contributing to uKF.

Methods218 patients who presented with uKF < 50 years old were recruited to the UKs 100,000 Genomes Project. Candidate variants in 183 genes were reviewed for pathogenicity by a multidisciplinary team. Gene-based association testing, structural variant analyses, and assessment of high-risk APOL1 genotypes were performed. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and various glomerulonephritides. HLA associations in those with APOL1 high-risk genotype were also investigated.

ResultsA positive genetic diagnosis was made in 17% (38/218) of patients. The median age of uKF onset was 36 years. Fewer genetic diagnoses were found in those aged [&ge;] 36 years compared to younger individuals, both with (11% vs. 35%, P=0.03) and without (5% vs. 19%, P=0.05) a family history. Three patients [&ge;] 36 years without a family history had pathogenic variants in type IV collagen genes. High-risk APOL1 genotypes were enriched in patients with recent African ancestry (52% vs 8.4%, P=5.97x10-8). Dividing the uKF cohort by subsequent identification of monogenic diagnosis, High-risk APOL1 genotype, or neither, we found that the SSNS PRS was higher in those with High-risk APOL1 (P=0.048), driven by differences at HLA-DQB1*03:19 (P=0.001).

ConclusionsThese findings estimate the likelihood of a genetic diagnosis using WGS in uKF patients, showing fewer diagnoses in older patients without a family history. APOL1 contributes significantly to uKF in those with recent African ancestry, potentially interacting with HLA-DQB1. The lack of PRS signal for CKD suggests distinct biology between uKF and more common causes of CKD.","NA","medrxiv",1729202965517

Recent work using single-cell transcriptomic approaches to create molecular definitions of cell types in the form of cell atlases has provided the necessary data for such an endeavor. Here, we present the Universal Cell Embedding (UCE) foundation model. UCE was trained on a corpus of cell atlas data from human and other species in a completely self-supervised way without any data annotations. UCE offers a unified biological latent space that can represent any cell, regardless of tissue or species. This universal cell embedding captures important biological variation despite the presence of experimental noise across diverse datasets. An important aspect of UCEs universality is that any new cell from any organism can be mapped to this embedding space with no additional data labeling, model training or fine-tuning. We applied UCE to create the Integrated Mega-scale Atlas, embedding 36 million cells, with more than 1,000 uniquely named cell types, from hundreds of experiments, dozens of tissues and eight species. We uncovered new insights about the organization of cell types and tissues within this universal cell embedding space, and leveraged it to infer function of newly discovered cell types. UCEs embedding space exhibits emergent behavior, uncovering new biology that it was never explicitly trained for, such as identifying developmental lineages and embedding data from novel species not included in the training set. Overall, by enabling a universal representation for every cell state and type, UCE provides a valuable tool for analysis, annotation and hypothesis generation as the scale and diversity of single cell datasets continues to grow.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965517

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states.

These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965518

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965518

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729202965518

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1729202965518
