Here, we use MENSA, Media Enriched with Newly Synthesized Antibodies, secreted exclusively from circulating human plasmablasts, to provide an immune snapshot that defines the underlying viral triggers. We provide proof-of-concept testing that the MENSA technology can capture the new host immune response to accurately diagnose acute primary and breakthrough infections when known SARS2 virus or proteins are present. It is also positive after vaccination when spike proteins elicit an acute immune response. Applying the same principles for long-COVID patients, MENSA is positive for SARS2 in 40% of PASC vs none of the COVID recovered (CR) patients without any sequelae demonstrating ongoing SARS2 viral inflammation only in PASC. Additionally, in PASC patients, MENSAs are also positive for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in 37%, Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 23%, and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) in 15% compared to 17%, 4%, and 4% in CR controls respectively. Combined, a total of 60% of PASC patients have a positive MENSA for SARS2, EBV, CMV, and/or HSV2. MENSA offers a unique antibody snapshot to reveal the underlying viral drivers in long-COVID thus demonstrating the persistence of SARS2 and reactivation of viral herpes in 60% of PASC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1720476520530

MethodsA total of 7361 asymptomatic community-dwelling people enrolled in the Test Us at Home parent study between October 2021 and February 2022. Participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing every 24-48 hours for 10-14 days, regardless of symptom or infection status. Participants who had no history of COVID-19 at enrollment and who were subsequently found to have [&ge;]1 positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the parent study were recontacted in August 2023 and asked whether they had experienced long COVID, defined as the development of new symptoms lasting 3 months or longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads, and slopes of viral clearance were modeled using post-nadir viral loads. Using a log binomial model with the modeled slopes as the exposure, we calculated the relative risk of subsequently developing long COVID with 1-2 symptoms, 3-4 symptoms, or 5+ symptoms, adjusting for age, number of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of individual long COVID symptoms based on viral clearance was also calculated.

Results172 participants were eligible for analyses, and 59 (34.3%) reported experiencing long COVID. The risk of long COVID with 3-4 symptoms and 5+ symptoms increased by 2.44 times (aRR: 2.44; 95% CI: 0.88-6.82) and 4.97 times (aRR: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.90-13.0) per viral load slope-unit increase, respectively. Participants who developed long COVID had significantly longer times from peak viral load to viral clearance during acute disease than those who never developed long COVID (8.65 [95% CI: 8.28-9.01] vs. 10.0 [95% CI: 9.25-10.8]). The slope of viral clearance was significantly positively associated with long COVID symptoms of fatigue (aRR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.22-6.69), brain fog (aRR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.21-11.0), shortness of breath (aRR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.24-20.6), and gastrointestinal symptoms (aRR: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.54-19.3).

DiscussionWe observed that longer time from peak viral load to viral RNA clearance during acute COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. Further, slower clearance rates were associated with greater number of symptoms of long COVID. These findings suggest that early viral-host dynamics are mechanistically important in the subsequent development of long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1720476520530

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

In this context, a major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms functionally alter microglia by shaping their transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We used RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD. We identified widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype, and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoforms protective role.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution1-3, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

We observed significant positive associations for Shannon entropy of path-length, instantaneous correlation distributions, and divergent associations of sample entropy at varying time-scales.

This study aimed to determine the potential quantities of infectious HPAIV in raw milk in affected states where herds were confirmed positive by USDA for HPAIV (and therefore were not representative of the entire population), and to confirm that the commonly used continuous flow pasteurization using the FDA approved 72{degrees}C (161{degrees}F) for 15 s conditions for high temperature short time (HTST) processing, will inactivate the virus. Double-blinded raw milk samples from bulk storage tanks from farms (n=275) were collected in four affected states. Samples were screened for influenza A using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qrRT-PCR) of which 158 (57.5%) were positive and were subsequently quantified in embryonating chicken eggs. Thirty-nine qrRT-PCR positive samples (24.8%) were positive for infectious virus with a mean titer of 3.5 log10 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) per mL. To closely simulate commercial milk pasteurization processing systems, a pilot-scale continuous flow pasteurizer was used to evaluate HPAIV inactivation in artificially contaminated raw milk using the most common legal conditions in the US: 72{degrees}C (161{degrees}F) for 15s.

However, how the diversity of centromeres evolved, ranging from localized centromeres in monocentric species to complex chromosome-wide distributed centromere regions in holocentric species, remains elusive. Our cellular and genomic analyses in Timema stick insects reveal that within cell variation of the major centromere protein CenH3 recapitulates the variation typically observed across species. While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or small groups of chromosomes, they exhibit a holocentric-like distribution on the sex chromosome and bind to more complex intergenic regions. Despite this contrasting distribution, all chromosomes, including the sex chromosome, attach to spindle microtubules at a single location, marking the first instance of a functionally monocentric species with holocentric-like attributes. Together, our findings highlight the potential for gradual transitions towards holocentricity or CenH3-independent centromere determination, and help to understand the rapid centromere sequence divergence between species.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Conversely, marine photosynthetic diversity is dominated by plastids gained by subsequent endosymbioses of photosynthetic eukaryotes, so-called complex plastids. The plastids of major eukaryotic lineages including cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, were originally all posited to derive from a single secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga. Subsequent phylogenetic resolution of eukaryotes indicated that separate events of plastid acquisition must have occurred to account for this distribution of plastids. The number of such events, however, and the donor organisms for the new plastid endosymbioses are still not resolved. A perceived bottleneck of endosymbiotic plastid gain is the development of protein targeting from the hosts into new plastids, and this supposition has often driven hypotheses towards minimising the number of plastid-gain events to explain plastid distribution in eukaryotes. But how plastid protein-targeting is established for new endosymbionts is often unclear, which makes it difficult to assess the likelihood of plastid transfers between lineages. Here we show that Kareniaceae dinoflagellates, that possess complex plastids known to be derived from haptophytes, acquired all the necessary protein import machinery from these haptophytes. Furthermore, cryo-electron tomography revealed that no additional membranes were added to the Kareniaceae complex plastid during serial endosymbiosis, suggesting that the haptophyte-derived import processes were sufficient. Our analyses suggests that complex red plastids are preadapted for horizontal transmission, potentially explaining their widespread distribution in aquatic algal diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

The huge number of scientific articles using the term arousal ([~]50.000) highlights the importance of the concept, but also explains why such a vast literature had never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

As early studies grappled with random error and insufficient information, incongruence or lack of resolution in phylogenomics is generally associated with inadequate modeling of biological phenomena combined with analytical issues leading to systematic biases. Few phylogenomic studies, however, explore the potential for random error or establish an expectation of what level of resolution should be expected from a given empirical dataset. In presenting incongruent results, phylogeneticists face a choice of providing a diverse array of results from different approaches or a single preferred tree, with few attempting to integrate uncertainties across methods. Recent phylogenetic work has uncovered many well-supported and often novel relationships, as well as more contentious findings, across the phylogeny of ants. Ants are the most species-rich lineage of social insects and among the most ecologically important terrestrial animals. As a result, they have attracted much research, including regarding systematics. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive genus-level phylogeny of the ants inferred using genomic data combined with an effort to evaluate signal and incongruence throughout. Here we provide deeper insight into and quantify uncertainty across the ant tree of life. We accomplish this with the most taxonomically comprehensive Ultraconserved Elements dataset to date, including 277 (81%) of recognized ant genera from all 16 extant subfamilies, representing over 98% of described species-level diversity. We use simulations to establish expectations for resolution, identify branches with less-than-expected concordance, and dissect the effects of data and model selection on recalcitrant nodes. We also construct a consensus tree integrating uncertainty from multiple analyses. Simulations show that hundreds of loci are needed to resolve recalcitrant nodes on our genus-level ant phylogeny, even under a best-case scenario of known model parameters and without systematic bias. This demonstrates that random error continues to play a role in phylogenomics. Our analyses provide a comprehensive picture of support and incongruence across the ant phylogeny, and our consensus topology is congruent with a recent phylogenomic study on the subfamily-level, while rendering a more realistic picture of uncertainty and significantly expanding generic sampling. We use this topology for divergence dating and find that assumptions about root age have significant impact on the dates inferred. Our results suggest that improved understanding of ant phylogeny will require both more data and better phylogenetic models. We also provide a workflow to identify under-supported nodes in concatenation analyses, outline a pragmatic way to reconcile conflicting results in phylogenomics, and introduce a user-friendly locus selection tool for divergence dating.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

When applied to unicellular eukaryotes such as Plasmodium parasites, scRNA-seq provides a single-cell resolution particularly valuable to study complex infections which are often comprised of mixed life stages and clones. Until now, the application of scRNA-seq has been mainly limited to in vitro and animal malaria models, despite known transcriptional differences as compared to circulating parasite populations. This is primarily due to the challenges of working with Plasmodium natural infections in endemic settings. We validated sample preparation methods and a novel single-cell RNA sequencing technology for the first time in P. knowlesi parasites which can be effectively implemented to analyze natural infections in low-resource settings. We recovered 22,345 P. knowlesi single-cell transcriptomes containing all asexual blood stages from 6 in vitro culture samples, with conditions mimicking natural infections, and generated the most extensive P. knowlesi single-cell dataset to date. All 6 samples produced reproducible circular UMAP projections with consistent cluster localization and high gene expression correlation, regardless of the sample preparation methods used. Biomarker expression and life stage annotation using the Malaria Cell Atlas P. knowlesi reference dataset further confirmed these results. In conclusion, the combination of adaptable sample preparation methods with novel preservation and scRNA-seq technology has the potential to fundamentally transform the study of natural infections. This approach unlocks the use of scRNA-seq in field studies which will lead to new insights into Plasmodium parasite biology.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

To explore the potential impact this policy could have, we estimated the number of young adults (18-25y) currently taking up smoking each year by area across the UK.

MethodsUsing data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), Annual Population Survey (APS), and Smoking Toolkit Study (STS), we estimated the total number of 18-25-year-olds in the UK taking up smoking each year, based on national estimates of population size (ONS) and the proportion who reported ever having been a regular smoker (STS). We used local data on adult smoking rates (APS) to apportion the national estimated number of young adults taking up smoking to specific areas.

ResultsAround 127,500 18-25-year-olds in the UK start smoking regularly each year (349 each day); 105,700 each year (290 each day) in England, 11,500 (32) in Scotland, 6,500 (18) in Wales, and 3,800 (10) in Northern Ireland. Estimates of uptake varied across localities: for example, North East Lincolnshire had the highest proportion of young adults taking up smoking each year (3.96%) and Wokingham had the lowest (0.85%).

ConclusionsDespite reductions in smoking prevalence over recent decades, hundreds of young adults in the UK start smoking every day. Data on rates of uptake among individual local authorities can be used to focus attention locally prior to the introduction of new age of sale laws.","NA","medrxiv",1720476520530

C. difficile YabG processes cortex destined proteins preproSleC into proSleC and CspBA to CspB and CspA. YabG also affects synthesis of spore coat/exosporium proteins CotA and CdeM. In prior work that identified CspA as the co-germinant receptor, mutations in yabG were found which altered the co-germinants required to initiate spore germination. To understand how these mutations in the yabG locus contribute to C. difficile spore germination, we introduced these mutations into an isogenic background. Spores derived from C. difficile yabGC207A (catalytically inactive), C. difficile yabGA46D, C. difficile yabGG37E, and C. difficile yabGP153L strains germinated in response to TA alone. Recombinantly expressed and purified preproSleC incubated with E. coli lysate expressing wild type YabG resulted in the removal of the pre sequence from preproSleC. Interestingly, only YabGA46D showed any activity towards purified preproSleC. Mutation of the YabG processing site in preproSleC (R119A) led to YabG shifting its processing to R115 or R112. Finally, changes in yabG expression under the mutant promoters were analyzed using a SNAP-tag and revealed expression differences at early and late stages of sporulation. Overall, our results support and expand upon the hypothesis that YabG is important for germination and spore assembly and, upon mutation of the processing site, can shift where it cleaves substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

In Arabidopsis thaliana, as in most flowering plants, the first zygotic cell division is asymmetric, giving rise to the embryo proper and an extraembryonic suspensor.

Zygotic polarization and differential cell identities in the daughter cells are controlled by the ERECTA-YODA pathway, a prototype receptor kinase-MAP kinase signaling pathway. This pathway also controls asymmetric cell divisions in the epidermis during stomatal development. In this context, the bHLH transcription factor ICE1/SCRM is a direct target of MPK3/6, and phosphorylation negatively controls SCRM activity by targeting the protein for proteasomal degradation. This raises the question if this regulatory module is also involved in the asymmetric division of the zygote.

Our results show that SCRM has a critical function in zygote polarization and acts in parallel with the known MPK3/6 target WRKY2 in activating the homeobox transcription factor gene WOX8. Our work further demonstrates that SCRM activity in the early embryo is positively controlled by MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation. Therefore, the mode of MAP kinase regulation of the same target protein fundamentally differs between the embryo and the epidermis, shedding light on cell type-specific, differential gene regulation by common signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Agona) has been increasingly recognised as a prominent cause of gastroenteritis. This serovar is a strong biofilm former that can undergo genome rearrangement and enter a viable but non-culturable state whilst remaining metabolically active. Similar strategies are employed by S. Typhi, the cause of typhoid fever, during human infection, which are believed to assist with the transition from acute infection to chronic carriage. Here we report S. Agona's ability to persist in people and examine factors that might be contributing to chronic carriage. Methods: A review of 2,233 S. Agona isolates from UK infections (2004-2020) and associated carriage was undertaken, in which 1,155 had short-read sequencing data available. A subset of 207 isolates was selected from different stages of acute and persistent infections within individual patients. The subset underwent long-read sequencing and genome structure (GS) analysis, as well as phenotyping assays including carbon source utilisation and biofilm formation. Associations between genotypes and phenotypes were investigated to compare acute infections to those which progress to chronic. Results: GS analysis revealed the conserved arrangement GS1.0 in 195 isolates, and 8 additional GSs in 12 isolates. These rearranged isolates were typically associated with early, convalescent carriage (3 weeks - 3 months). We also identified an increase in SNP variation during this period of infection. Conclusion: We believe this increase in genome-scale and SNP variation reflects a population expansion after acute S Agona infection, potentially reflecting an immune evasion mechanism which enables persistent infection to become established.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Samples from 998 individuals (mean[range] age 68.5[20.0-92.5], 53% female) from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort were analyzed. Plasma p-tau217 was measured with mass spectrometry (MS) assays (the ratio between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated [%p-tau217WashU]and p-tau217WashU) as well as with immunoassays (p-tau217Lilly, p-tau217Janssen, p-tau217ALZpath).

Plasma %p-tau217 also correlated more strongly with baseline cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination[MMSE]) than all immunoassays (R2 %p-tau217WashU: 0.33; immunoassays: 0.27-0.30; Pdiff<0.024). The main results were replicated in an external cohort from Washington University in St Louis (n =219). Finally, p-tau217Nulisa showed similar performance to other immunoassays in subsets of both cohorts.

In summary, both MS-and immunoassay-based p-tau217 tests generally perform well in identifying A{beta}-PET, tau-PET, and cognitive abnormalities, but %p-tau217WashU performed significantly better than all the examined immunoassays. Plasma %p-tau217 may be considered as a stand-alone confirmatory test for AD pathology, while some immunoassays might be better suited as triage tests where positive results are confirmed with a second test.","NA","medrxiv",1720476520530

In S. cerevisiae, the Tel1 kinase (ortholog of human ATM) is activated at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and short telomeres. Despite the well-established roles of Tel1 in the control of telomere maintenance, suppression of chromosomal rearrangements, activation of cell cycle checkpoints, and repair of DSBs, the substrates through which Tel1 controls these processes remain incompletely understood. Here we performed an in depth phosphoproteomic screen for Tel1-dependent phosphorylation events. To achieve maximal coverage of the phosphoproteome, we developed a scaled- up approach that accommodates large amounts of protein extracts and chromatographic fractions. Compared to previous reports, we expanded the number of detected Tel1-dependent phosphorylation events by over 10-fold. Surprisingly, in addition to the identification of phosphorylation sites featuring the canonical motif for Tel1 phosphorylation (S/T-Q), the results revealed a novel motif (D/E-S/T) highly prevalent and enriched in the set of Tel1-dependent events. This motif is unique to Tel1 signaling and not shared with the Mec1 kinase, providing clues to how Tel1 plays specialized roles in DNA repair and telomere length control. Overall, these findings define a Tel1-signaling network targeting numerous proteins involved in DNA repair, chromatin regulation, and telomere maintenance that represents a framework for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of Tel1 action.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Due to the limited spatiotemporal precision of established methods for molecular tracking, current knowledge of dynein stepping is essentially limited to slowed-down measurements in vitro. Here, we use MINFLUX fluorophore localization to directly track CRISPR/Cas9-tagged endogenous dynein with nanometer/millisecond precision in living primary neurons. We show that endogenous dynein primarily takes 8 nm steps, including frequent sideways steps but few backward steps. Strikingly, the majority of direction reversals between retrograde and anterograde movement occurred on the time scale of single steps (16 ms), suggesting a rapid regulatory reversal mechanism. Tug-of-war-like behavior during pauses or reversals was unexpectedly rare. By analyzing the dwell time between steps, we concluded that a single rate-limiting process underlies the dynein stepping mechanism whereby dynein consumes one adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) per step. Our study underscores the power of MINFLUX localization to elucidate the spatiotemporal changes underlying protein function in living cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans. Furthermore, hippocampal activity scaled with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area (SMA) represented individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans.

Here we characterise the growth of the isolate Nitrobacter strain NHB1 as a function of pH and nitrite (NO2-) concentration, and its influence on the activity of acidophilic soil ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA). NHB1 is acidotolerant and grows optimally at pH 6.0 (range 5.0 - 7.5) at initial NO2- concentrations of 500 M. However, the optimum decreases to pH 5.0 at lower initial NO2- concentrations typically found in soil, with detectable growth down to pH 3.5. NHB1 has a comparatively high affinity for NO2- with an apparent-half-saturation constant (54 M) one order of magnitude lower than its closest relative, the neutrophilic strain Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14. In co-culture, NHB1 enhances the growth of acidophilic AOA. Specifically, Nitrosotalea devaniterrae Nd1 and Nitrosotalea sinensis Nd2 are sensitive to NO2--derived compounds and only oxidise ~200-300 M ammonia (NH3) in batch cultures. However, in co-culture with NHB1, pH ranges were lowered by ~0.5 pH units and both strains could oxidise up to 3 mM NH3, only limited by buffering capacity. NHB1 possesses a cyanase facilitating reciprocal cross-feeding via generating cyanate-derived NH3 and utilising AOA-derived NO2-. Removal of NO2- is likely crucial for the growth of nitrifiers in acidic soils and this study highlights the importance of considering substrate and metabolic product concentrations when characterising physiology.

In this study, by combining metabolic modeling, rational engineering, and adaptive laboratory evolution, we fundamentally redesigned bacterial catabolism. We created a new-to-nature shikimate pathway-dependent catabolism (SDC) in Pseudomonas putida by reprogramming the shikimate pathway as the primary catabolic route. SDC supports growth by supplying the glycerol catabolic end-product pyruvate, enabling superior production of shikimate pathway-derived molecules. Through SDC, aromatics production reached over 89% of the pathway's maximum theoretical yield, setting a new benchmark for their microbial synthesis. Our study successfully repurposed an anabolic pathway for catabolism, exemplifying the high metabolic plasticity of microbes and providing a bacterial chassis for the efficient production of high-added value compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Most miniaturized neural interfaces require a wired connection for external power and data acquisition systems. The wires are required to be commutated through a slip ring to accommodate for twisting of the wire or tether and alleviate torsional stresses. The increased trend towards long term continuous neural recordings have spurred efforts to realize active commutators that can sense the torsional stress and actively rotation the slip ring to alleviate torsional stresses. Current solutions however require addition of sensing modules. Here we report on an active translating commutator that uses computer vision (CV) algorithms on behavioral imaging videos captured during the experiment to track the animals position and heading direction in real-time and uses this information to control the translation and rotation of a slipring commutator to accommodate for accumulated mouse heading orientation changes and position. The CV guided active commutator has been extensively tested in three separate behavioral contexts and we show reliable cortex-wide imaging in a mouse in an open-field with a miniaturized widefield cortical imaging device.

A passive adaptation of protein degradation and dilution rates operates in cells tightly coupling proliferation rate to protein synthesis rates, allowing to partially buffer changes in proteome concentrations with increased loss of short-lived proteins. In contrast, the proliferation rate of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is hyposensitive to moderate changes in protein synthesis. mESCs uncouple protein degradation and dilution rates and robustly maintain their protein levels.

In an attempt to modify branch orientation, growers use many different management practices, including tying branches to wires or applying growth regulator sprays. However, these practices are often costly and ineffective. In contrast, altering the expression of genes that control branch angles and orientations would permanently optimize tree architecture with minimal management inputs. One gene implicated in branch angle control is LAZY1, which promotes upward branch growth in response to gravity. We used an antisense vector to silence LAZY1 in plum (Prunus domestica). We found that these LAZY1-silenced lines have significantly increased branch and petiole angles. In addition, they lack apical dominance and display a ""wandering"" or weeping branch trajectory. Given these phenotypes, we assessed whether the strength or stiffness of the branches were compromised. No differences were observed in new growth. While the wood of first-year LAZY1-silenced branches was more flexible and weaker than the control, the strength and stiffness of the branches were not decreased because branch diameter is increased. Finally, we evaluated the utility of LAZY1-silenced trees for two planar orchard systems, training them in super slender axe and espalier. LAZY1-silenced trees had more open canopies and were easier to constrain to the trellis height.

The increasing development of antibiotic resistance in this organism is a global health concern. The A. baumannii clinical isolate AB307-0294 produces a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that delivers three antibacterial cargo effector proteins (Tse15, Tde16 and Tae17) that give this strain a competitive advantage against other bacteria in polymicrobial environments. These effectors are delivered via specific non-covalent interactions with the T6SS needle tip proteins VgrG15, VgrG16 and VgrG17, respectively. Here we determine the molecular function of the Tae17 effector protein and define the regions of Tae17 and VgrG17 essential for its delivery. Specifically, we show that Tae17 is a multidomain, bifunctional peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme. Tae17 has both lytic transglycosylase activity, which targets the peptidoglycan sugar backbone, and amidase activity, which targets the sugar-peptide bonds. Moreover, we show that the transglycosylase activity was more important for killing Escherichia coli. Using deletion constructs and bacterial two-hybrid analyses, we identify that amino acids 1051-1085 of the VgrG17 needle tip protein and amino acids 1-162 of the Tae17 effector protein are necessary for the Tae17:VgrG17 interaction. Furthermore, we identify the VgrG17 amino acids G1069 and W1075 as crucial for the delivery of Tae17; the first time such specific delivery determinants of T6SS cargo effectors have been defined. This study provides molecular insight into how the T6SS allows A. baumannii strains to gain dominance in polymicrobial communities and thus improve their chances of survival and transmission.

IMPORTANCEWe have shown that the Acinetobacter baumannii T6SS effector Tae17 is a modular, bifunctional, peptidoglycan-degrading enzyme that has both lytic transglycosylase and amidase activity. Both activities contribute to the ability to degrade peptidoglycan, but the glycosyltransferase activity was more important for the interbacterial killing of Escherichia coli. We have defined the specific regions of Tae17 and its cognate delivery protein VgrG17 that are necessary for the non-covalent interactions and, for the first time, identified specific amino acids essential for delivery. This work contributes to our molecular understanding of bacterial competition strategies in polymicrobial environments and may provide a window to the design of new therapeutic approaches for combating infection by A. baumannii.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently replicate and infect chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates PB2-627V maintains stable functionality across the two distinct hosts. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Here, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis of mice subjected to 20 compound treatments in the Interventions Testing Program (ITP). By integrating it with the data from over 4,000 rodent tissues representing aging and responses to genetic, pharmacological, and dietary interventions with established survival data, we developed robust multi-tissue transcriptomic biomarkers of mortality, capable of quantifying aging and change in lifespan in both short-lived and long-lived models. These tools were further extended to single-cell and human data, demonstrating common mechanisms of molecular aging across cell types and species. Via a network analysis, we identified and annotated 26 co-regulated modules of aging and longevity across tissues, and developed interpretable module-specific clocks that capture aging- and mortality-associated phenotypes of functional components, including, among others, inflammatory response, mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, and extracellular matrix organization. These tools captured and characterized acceleration of biological age induced by progeria models and chronic diseases in rodents and humans. They also revealed rejuvenation induced by heterochronic parabiosis, early embryogenesis, and cellular reprogramming, highlighting universal signatures of mortality, shared across models of rejuvenation and age-related disease. They included Cdkn1a and Lgals3, whose human plasma levels further demonstrated a strong association with all-cause mortality, disease incidence and risk factors, such as obesity and hypertension. Overall, this study uncovers molecular hallmarks of mammalian mortality shared across organs, cell types, species and models of disease and rejuvenation, exposing fundamental mechanisms of aging and longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

TRPML1 can be allosterically regulated by various ligands including natural lipids and small synthetic molecules and the channel undergoes a global movement propagated from ligand-induced local conformational changes upon activation. In this study, we identified a functionally critical residue, Tyr404, at the C-terminus of the S4 helix, whose mutations to tryptophan and alanine yield gain- and loss-of-function channels, respectively. These allosteric mutations mimic the ligand activation or inhibition of the TRPML1 channel without interfering with ligand binding and both mutant channels are susceptible to agonist or antagonist modulation, making them better targets for screening potent TRPML1 activators and inhibitors. We also determined the high-resolution structure of TRPML1 in complex with the PI(4,5)P2 inhibitor, revealing the structural basis underlying this lipid inhibition. In addition, an endogenous phospholipid likely from sphingomyelin is identified in the PI(4,5)P2-bound TRPML1 structure at the same hotspot for agonists and antagonists, providing a plausible structural explanation for the inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin on agonist activation.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Mitochondrial activity is modulated by the processes of mitochondrial fission and fusion, which are required to properly balance respiratory and metabolic functions, transfer material between mitochondria, and remove defective mitochondria. Mitochondrial fission occurs at sites of contact between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, and is dependent on the formation of actin filaments that drive mitochondrial constriction and the recruitment and activation of the dynamin-related GTPase fission protein DRP1. The requirement for mitochondria- and ER-associated actin filaments in mitochondrial fission remains unclear, and the role of actin in mitochondrial fusion remains entirely unexplored. Here we show that preventing the formation of actin filaments on either mitochondria or the ER disrupts both mitochondrial fission and fusion. We show that fusion but not fission is dependent on Arp2/3, whereas both fission and fusion are dependent on INF2 formin-dependent actin polymerization. We also show that mitochondria-associated actin marks fusion sites prior to the dynamin family GTPase fusion protein MFN2. Together, our work introduces a novel method for perturbing organelle-associated actin filaments, and demonstrates a previously unknown role for actin in mitochondrial fusion.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

In Drosophila melanogaster, the inhibition of autophagy, specifically in adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs), affects their number differently through aging. Appropriate intestinal renewal requires a balance between ISC proliferation and differentiation. Herein, we show that in adult ISCs, the loss of core autophagy genes and regulators of autophagosome-lysosome fusion increased the enteroendocrine cell population and transcriptional activity of Stat92E. Functional experiments with cell fate regulators involved in enteroendocrine or enterocyte differentiation or proliferation suggested that dysfunctional autophagy in adult ISCs enhanced Stat92E activity downstream of Hop/JAK kinase. Finally, lineage-tracing analyses confirmed that autophagy inhibition autonomously promotes enteroendocrine cell differentiation without affecting enterocyte differentiation. Thus, our data demonstrates that, under homeostatic conditions, basal autophagy limits enteroendocrine cell differentiation by controlling Stat92E activity.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Nanotiming solely demands the labelling of asynchronously growing cells with an innocuous dose of BrdU during one doubling time followed by BrdU quantification along nanopore reads. We demonstrate in yeast S. cerevisiae that Nanotiming precisely reproduces RT profiles generated by reference methods in wild-type and mutant cells inactivated for known RT determinants, for one-tenth of the cost. Nanotiming is simple, accurate, inexpensive, amenable to large-scale analyses, and is capable of unveiling RT at individual telomeres, revealing that Rif1 iconic telomere regulator directly delays the replication only of telomeres with specific subtelomeric elements.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Our study investigates the mechanisms and developmental dynamics of dosage compensation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation in the stick insect species T. poppense. Stick insects are characterized by XX/XO sex determination and an X chromosome which likely evolved prior to the diversification of insects over 450 Mya. We generated a chromosome-level genome assembly and analyzed gene expression from various tissues (brain, gut, antennae, leg, and reproductive tract) across developmental stages in both sexes. Our results show that complete dosage compensation is maintained in male somatic tissues throughout development, mediated by upregulation of the single X chromosome. Contrarily, in male reproductive tissues, dosage compensation is present only in the early nymphal stages. As males reach the 4th nymphal stage and adulthood, X-linked gene expression diminishes, coinciding with the onset of MSCI. This reduction is associated with histone modifications indicative of transcriptional silencing, aligning with meiotic progression. These findings reveal the dynamic regulation of X-linked gene expression in T. poppense, and suggest that reduced X-expression in insect testes is generally driven by MSCI rather than an absence of dosage compensation mechanisms. Our work provides critical insights into sex chromosome evolution and the complex interplay of dosage compensation and MSCI across tissues and developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

One of the factors thought to be essential for AMP potency is their conformational flexibility, but characterizing the diverse conformational states of AMPs experimentally remains challenging. Here we introduce a method for characterising the conformational flexibility of AMPs and provide new insights into how the interplay between conformation and aggregation in synergistic AMP combinations yields emergent properties. We use unsupervised learning and molecular dynamics simulations to show that mixing two AMPs from the Winter Flounder family (pleurocidin (WF2) & WF1a) constrains their conformational space, reducing the number of distinct conformations adopted by the peptides, most notably for WF2. The aggregation behaviour of the peptides is also altered, favouring the formation of higher-order aggregates upon mixing. Critically, the interaction between WF1a and WF2 influences the distribution of WF2 conformations within aggregates, revealing how WF1a can modulate WF2 behaviour. Our work paves the way for deeper understanding of the synergy between AMPs, a fundamental process in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

However, the data produced by these screens are often noisy due to cost and technical constraints, limiting power to detect true effects with conventional differential expression analyses. Here, we introduce TRanscriptome-wide Analysis of Differential Expression (TRADE), a statistical framework which estimates the transcriptome-wide distribution of true differential expression effects from noisy gene-level measurements. Within TRADE, we derive multiple novel, interpretable statistical metrics, including the ""transcriptome-wide impact"", an estimator of the overall transcriptional effect of a perturbation which is stable across sampling depths. We analyze new and published large-scale Perturb-seq datasets to show that many true transcriptional effects are not statistically significant, but detectable in aggregate with TRADE. In a genome-scale Perturb-seq screen, we find that a typical gene perturbation affects an estimated 45 genes, whereas a typical essential gene perturbation affects over 500 genes. An advantage of our approach is its ability to compare the transcriptomic effects of genetic perturbations across contexts and dosages despite differences in power. We use this ability to identify perturbations with cell-type dependent effects and to find examples of perturbations where transcriptional responses are not only larger in magnitude, but also qualitatively different, as a function of dosage. Lastly, we expand our analysis to case/control comparison of gene expression for neuropsychiatric conditions, finding that transcriptomic effect correlations are greater than genetic correlations for these diagnoses. TRADE lays an analytic foundation for the systematic comparison of genetic perturbation atlases, as well as differential expression experiments more broadly.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Although such genomic differences are thought to make key contributions to distinctly modern human traits, experimental validation of their potential impact was so far restricted to functional assays and model organisms. With the availability of large-scale genetically informative population databases, it now becomes possible to identify present-day carriers of rare archaic alleles of interest and to directly assess putative phenotypic consequences in living humans. We queried exome sequencing data of around half a million people in the UK Biobank in search of carriers of archaic alleles at 37 genomic positions with supposedly fixed human-specific changes. This search yielded 103 carriers of the archaic allele for 17 positions, with diverging allele counts across ancestries. We contrasted carriers of an exemplary archaic allele in SSH2 with a curated set of non-carriers, observing no deviation from the norm in a range of health, psychological, and cognitive traits. We also identified 62 carriers of the archaic allele of a missense change in the TKTL1 gene, previously reported to have large effects on cortical neurogenesis based on functional analyses in brain organoids and animal models. However, human carriers of the archaic TKTL1 allele did not show differences in anatomical brain measures and qualification level, compared to non-carriers. These results highlight the importance of investigating diverse ancestral populations for a more accurate representation of shared human variation and challenge the notion of permanently fixed genetic changes that set Homo sapiens apart from Neandertals and Denisovans.

Moreover, we provide evidence that TMEM9B-AS1 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis by facilitating mRNA stabilization of the transcription factor MYC through a direct physical interaction with the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1. Disrupted ribosomal biogenesis resulting from TMEM9B-AS1 silencing is linked reduced skeletal muscle mass in type 2 diabetes, elucidating molecular mechanisms contributing to skeletal muscle loss in metabolic disease.

Full-field flicker also evokes perception of hallucinatory geometric patterns, which mathematical models explain as standing-wave formations emerging from periodic forcing at resonant frequencies of the simulated neural network. However, empirical evidence for such flicker-induced standing waves in the visual cortex was missing. We recorded cortical responses to flicker in awake mice using high spatial resolution widefield imaging in combination with high temporal resolution glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR). The temporal frequency tuning curves in the mouse V1 were similar to those observed in humans, showing a banded structure with multiple resonance peaks (8 Hz, 15 Hz, 33 Hz). Spatially, all flicker frequencies evoked responses in V1 corresponding to retinotopic stimulus location, but some evoked additional peaks. These flicker-induced cortical patterns displayed standing wave characteristics and matched linear wave equation solutions in an area restricted to the visual cortex. Taken together, the interaction of traveling waves with cortical area boundaries leads to spatiotemporal activity patterns that may affect perception.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Predictive processing theories posit that psychedelics work by loosening priors or high-level beliefs, including ingrained biases that have become pathological, leading to shifts in bottom-up vs top-down information processing that reconfigure perception, cognition, and mood. Because 5-HT2A receptors, the primary target of psychedelics, are enriched in visual cortices, we investigated whether psychedelics alter visual processing in a manner consistent with predictive processing theories. People who recently (<3 weeks) used 5-HT2A-agonist psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) exhibited slowed response latencies and increased cortical involvement in generating saccades to targets in predictable locations, along with a generalization of sensory prediction errors (i.e., deviance detection) during passive visual processing. Individuals who recently used a 5-HT1A-selective psychedelic (5-MeO-DMT) displayed similar changes in saccade production, but unaltered deviance detection, suggesting circuit-specific effects. Mice administered DOI (5-HT2A-agonist) exhibited altered deviance detection within primary visual cortex (V1), along with weakened top-down feedback to V1 from higher cortical area ACa. These results concord with the hypothesis that psychedelics shift the balance from top-down to bottom-up in sensory cortical circuits -- an effect that persists beyond the acute exposure period.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Here, we used de novo protein structure modeling and sensitive sequence similarity detection algorithms within an expanded Asgard archaeal genomic dataset to build a structural catalogue of the Asgard archaeal pangenome and identify 908 new  isomorphic ESPs (iESPs), representing clusters of protein structures most similar to eukaryotic proteins and that likely underwent extensive sequence divergence.

Traditionally, miniscopes have only been able to record from a single fluorescence wavelength. Here, we present a new open-source dual-channel Miniscope that simultaneously records two wavelengths in freely behaving animals, providing more flexibility and function. To enable simultaneous acquisition of two fluorescent wavelengths, we incorporated two CMOS sensors with two independent sets of emission filters into a single Miniscope. This enables us to acquire images at the full frame rate that the CMOS sensor supports while simultaneously eliminating crosstalk between channels, which allows imaging fluorophores that heavily overlap in their emission spectrums (for example, GFP and tdTomato). We adopted a design that enables adjusting the position of one imaging sensor along the light path to match the focal plane of the other sensor, providing additional flexibility for calibration. To validate our dual-channel Miniscope in vivo, we imaged hippocampal CA1 region that co-expressed a dynamic calcium indicator (GCaMP) and a static nuclear signal (constitutively active tdTomato) while mice ran on a linear track. We used GCaMP signals to investigate spatial coding in the hippocampus and tdTomato signals as a landmark for registration of neurons across recording sessions. Our results suggest that, even when neurons were registered across recording sessions using tdTomato signals, hippocampal spatial coding changes over time as previously reported. In conclusion, our novel dual-channel Miniscope enables imaging of two fluorescence wavelengths in the same focal plane with minimal crosstalk between the two channels, opening the doors to a multitude of new experimental possibilities.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

In this study, we have investigated the natural neonatal development of the mucus barrier and sentinel goblet cell-dependent secretory responses upon postnatal colonization. Combined in vivo and ex vivo analyses of pre- and post-weaning colonic mucus barrier and sentinel goblet cell maturation demonstrated a sequential microbiota-dependent development of these primary and secondary goblet cell-intrinsic protective functions, with dynamic changes in mucus processing dependent on innate immune signalling via MyD88, and development of functional sentinel goblet cells dependent on the NADPH/Dual oxidase family member Duox2. Our findings therefore identify new mechanisms of microbiota-goblet cell regulatory interaction and highlight the critical importance of the pre-weaning period for the normal development of colonic barrier function.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely-related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the Drosophila taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses, and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food texture and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate textures. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

The concepts of grammar and semantics from natural language have been shown to be applicable to understanding functional properties of viral proteins like antigenicity. Here, we investigate how these representations more broadly enable assessment of both observed and previously unobserved variation due to mutation. Applied to SARS-CoV-2's spike protein we demonstrate the PLM, ESM-2, has learned the sequence context within which variation occurs, capturing evolutionary constraint. We demonstrate this recapitulates what conventionally requires MSA data predicting both where variation does and does not accumulate across the protein. We show the PLM-derived measures of amino acid change represent novel metrics as they do not correlate strongly with classical metrics of change in sequences. Applied to SARS-CoV-2 variants across the pandemic we demonstrate that ESM-2 representations encode the relatedness between variants, i.e., their evolutionary history, as well as the distinct nature of variants of concern upon their emergence, associated with shifts in receptor binding and antigenicity. This application of ESM-2 can be used for characterising the evolutionary potential and possible epidemiological impact of both existing and emerging variation, with the potential to be applied to any protein sequence, pathogen or otherwise.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

While lipid ATG8ylation is important for autophagosome formation and mechanistically well-characterized, little is known about the mechanism of protein ATG8ylation. Here, we investigated the conjugation machinery of protein ATG8ylation in CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knockout human cell lines, utilizing a deconjugation-resistant (Q116P G120) form of MAP1LC3B. We report that protein ATG8ylation requires the E1-like activating enzyme ATG7 and E2-like conjugating enzyme ATG3, in common with ATG8 lipidation. However, in contrast, the E3-like ATG12-ATG5-ATG16L1 complex involved in lipidation is dispensable for protein ATG8ylation, since ATG5 knockout cells can form ATG8ylated protein conjugates. Further, we uncover that ATG7 itself is a target of ATG8ylation.

As a mechanism of study, we use antisense RNAs (asRNAs). The asRNAs are expressed with the existing messenger RNA (mRNA) of a logic gate in a single transcript and target mRNAs of adjacent gates, creating a feedback of the protein-mediated repression that implements the core function of the logic gates. The extended transcripts then share a common sequestration reaction mediated by the cellular hosts RNA metabolism. This sequestration consists of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation by asRNA and adjacent mRNA and subsequent degradation by the host. Numerical and stochastic analysis suggests that the feedback increases the steepness of the gates transition region, reduces the leakage, and can potentially be used to adjust the transition location. To leverage these effects, we demonstrate how design parameters can be tuned to obtain desired dose-response curves and how arbitrary circuits can be assembled using the improved gates.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.

MethodsSurveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.

ResultsThe Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.

ConclusionsUrgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak.","10.1038/s41591-024-03130-3","medrxiv",1720476520530

Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1720476520530

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720476520530

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720476520530

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
