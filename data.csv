JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

However, unintended bystander editing beyond the target nucleotide poses a challenge to their translation into effective therapies. While many efforts have been made in the design of a universal enzyme with minimal bystander editing, the context dependent activity represents a major challenge for base editing-based therapies. In this work, we designed a sequence-specific guide RNA library with 3 prime-extensions and detected guides that were able to reduce bystander and increase editing efficiency in a context dependent manner. The best candidate was later used for phage assisted non-continuous evolution to find a new generation of precise base editors. Simultaneously, we use protein language models trained on massive protein sequence datasets to find the evolutionarily plausible mutational patterns that can improve deaminase activity and precision. Both strategies provide a collection of precise TadA variants that not only drastically reduced bystander edits, but also was not in detriment of on-target activity. Our findings introduce a guide/enzyme parallel engineering pipeline, which lays the foundation for the development of new personalized genome editing strategies, ultimately enhancing the safety and precision of this groundbreaking technology.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Profiling lysosomal content using tag-based lysosomal immunoprecipitation (LysoTagIP) in cell and animal models allowed major discoveries in the field, however studying lysosomal dysfunction in human patients remains challenging. Here, we report the development of the tagless LysoIP method to enable rapid enrichment of lysosomes, via immunoprecipitation, using the endogenous integral lysosomal membrane protein TMEM192, directly from clinical samples and human cell lines (e.g. induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSCs) derived neurons). Isolated lysosomes are intact and suitable for subsequent multimodal omics analyses. To validate our approach, we employed the tagless LysoIP to enrich lysosomes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from fresh blood of patients with CLN3 disease, a neurodegenerative LSD. Metabolic profiling of isolated lysosomes showed massive accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs) in patients' lysosomes. Interestingly, a patient with a milder phenotype and genotype displayed lower accumulation of lysosomal GPDs, consistent with their potential role as disease biomarkers. Altogether, the tagless LysoIP provides a framework to study native lysosomes from patient samples, identify novel biomarkers and discover human-relevant disease mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Differences in the cell of origin provide a potential explanation, but these assays have traditionally relied on surface markers, lacking the clonal resolution to distinguish heterogeneous subsets of stem and progenitor cells. To address this challenge, we developed STRACK, an unbiased framework to longitudinally trace clonal gene expression and expansion dynamics before and after acquisition of cancer mutations. We studied two different leukemia driver mutations, Dnmt3a-R882H and Npm1cA, and found that the response to both mutations was highly variable across different stem cell states. Specifically, a subset of differentiation-biased stem cells, which normally become outcompeted with time, can efficiently expand with both mutations. Npm1c mutations surprisingly reversed the intrinsic bias of the clone-of-origin, with stem-biased clones giving rise to more mature malignant states. We propose a clonal reaction norm, in which pre-existing clonal states show different cancer phenotypic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants' speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound 'Bouba' or 'Kiki'. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the 'Kiki' sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the 'Bouba' sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Critical next steps are to infer which and how many cell types are truly causal for a disease (after accounting for co-regulation across cell types), and to understand how individual variants impact disease risk through single or multiple causal cell types. Here, we propose CT-FM and CT-FM-SNP, two methods that leverage cell-type-specific cREs to fine-map causal cell types for a trait and for its candidate causal variants, respectively. We applied CT-FM to 63 GWAS summary statistics (average N = 417K) using nearly one thousand cRE annotations, primarily coming from ENCODE4. CT-FM inferred 81 causal cell types with corresponding SNP-annotations explaining a high fraction of trait SNP-heritability (~2/3 of the SNP-heritability explained by existing cREs), identified 16 traits with multiple causal cell types, highlighted cell-disease relationships consistent with known biology, and uncovered previously unexplored cellular mechanisms in psychiatric and immune-related diseases. Finally, we applied CT-FM-SNP to 39 UK Biobank traits and predicted high confidence causal cell types for 2,798 candidate causal non-coding SNPs. Our results suggest that most SNPs impact a phenotype through a single cell type, and that pleiotropic SNPs target different cell types depending on the phenotype context.

Here, as proof of concept, we searched for viral remnants in sequencing reads of Neanderthal genome data by mapping to adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus, which are double stranded DNA viruses that may establish lifelong latency and can, produce persistent infections. The reconstructed ancient viral genomes of adenovirus, herpesvirus and papillomavirus revealed conserved segments, with nucleotide similarity to extant viral genomes, and variable regions in coding regions with substantial divergence to extant close relatives. Sequencing reads mapped to extant viral genomes showed deamination patterns of ancient DNA and that these ancient viral genomes showed divergence consistent with the age of these samples ({approx}50,000 years) and viral evolutionary rates (10-5 to 10-8 substitutions/site/year). Analysis of random effects shows that the Neanderthal mapping to genomes of extant persistent viruses is above the expected by random similarities of short reads. Also, negative control with a nonpersistent DNA virus does not yield statistically significant assemblies. This work demonstrates the feasibility of identifying viral genome remnants in archaeological samples with signal-to-noise assessment.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

In particular, the contribution of the stromal microenvironment to pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis requires further exploration. Here, we report the stromal roles of the synaptic protein Netrin G1 Ligand (NGL-1) in pancreatic cancer, uncovering its pro-tumor functions in cancer-associated fibroblasts and in immune cells. We observed that the stromal expression of NGL-1 inversely correlated with patient overall survival. Moreover, germline knockout (KO) mice for NGL-1 presented decreased tumor burden, with a microenvironment that is less supportive of tumor growth. Of note, tumors from NGL-1 KO mice produced less immunosuppressive cytokines and displayed an increased percentage of CD8+ T cells than those from control mice, while preserving the physical structure of the tumor microenvironment. These effects were shown to be mediated by NGL-1 in both immune cells and in the local stroma, in a TGF-{beta}-dependent manner. While myeloid cells lacking NGL-1 decreased the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, NGL-1 KO T cells showed increased proliferation rates and overall polyfunctionality compared to control T cells. CAFs lacking NGL-1 were less immunosuppressive than controls, with overall decreased production of pro-tumor cytokines and compromised ability to inhibit CD8+ T cells activation. Mechanistically, these CAFs downregulated components of the TGF-{beta} pathway, AP-1 and NFAT transcription factor families, resulting in a less tumor-supportive phenotype. Finally, targeting NGL-1 genetically or using a functionally antagonistic small peptide phenocopied the effects of chemotherapy, while modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), rather than eliminating it. We propose NGL-1 as a new local stroma and immunomodulatory molecule, with pro-tumor roles in pancreatic cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

The success of widely varied architectures has motivated the prevailing hypothesis that large-scale pre-training is the primary factor underlying the similarities between brains and neural networks. Here, we challenge this view by revealing the role of architectural inductive biases in models with minimal training. We examined networks with varied architectures but no pre-training and quantified their ability to predict image representations in the visual cortices of both monkeys and humans. We found that cortex-aligned representations emerge in convolutional architectures that combine two key manipulations of dimensionality: compression in the spatial domain and expansion in the feature domain. We further show that the inductive biases of convolutional architectures are critical for obtaining performance gains from feature expansion - dimensionality manipulations were relatively ineffective in other architectures and in convolutional models with targeted lesions.

Here, we tested the associations of genetic instruments for 49 complement and coagulation factors from the UK Biobank (N=34,557) with long COVID in the Long COVID Host Genetics Initiative (N=997,600). Primary analyses revealed that genetically predicted higher factor XI increased long COVID risk (odds ratio, 1.17 [95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.27] per standard deviation; P=1.7 x10-4). This association was robust to sensitivity analyses using pleiotropy-robust methods and different genetic instruments and was replicated using proteogenomic data from an Icelandic cohort. Genetically predicted factor XI was also associated with venous thromboembolism, but not with acute COVID-19 or long COVID-resembling conditions.

We show that this embedding space yields sequence representations that enable state-of-the-art performance across a variety of important yet challenging tasks in the study of proteins -- from predicting protein protein interactions to accurately detecting homologous proteins despite low sequence similarity.

Upon DNA-binding, cGAS generates cGAMP, which binds to STING, ultimately driving inflammatory signalling. Although normally silenced on self-DNA, cGAS can be activated during genotoxic stress. A universal by-product of these conditions are micronuclei, which accumulate cGAS, and which are therefore thought to be major cGAS activators. However, due to the inability to visualise cGAS activation in single cells, this hypothesis remains largely untested. Here we solve this question with an improved intracellular cGAMP reporter, which is compatible with microscopy, flow-cytometry and plate reader setups. Surprisingly, cGAS activation in response to multiple types of genotoxic stress is limited to a subfraction of cells and does not correlate with cGAS enrichment in micronuclei. Overall, our findings suggest a revised model of innate immune signalling in response to genotoxic stress, and introduce a novel and flexible tool with which to examine this model in future.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Our open-source software enables users to annotate cells using existing ontologies and to probabilistically match cell types between two or more contexts, including across species. CellWalker2 can also map genomic regions to cell ontologies, enabling precise annotation of elements derived from bulk data, such as enhancers, genetic variants, and sequence motifs. Through simulation studies, we show that CellWalker2 performs better than existing methods in cell type annotation and mapping. We then use data from the brain and immune system to demonstrate CellWalker2's ability to discover cell type-specific regulatory programs and both conserved and divergent cell type relationships in complex tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1{beta} activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions that prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiment in mice confirms that IL-1{beta} significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spreading in the lung epithelia.

In medical education, research conducted in 2016 found that authors were influenced by multiple factors such as a journal's prestige and its mission. However, since this research was conducted the publishing landscape has shifted to include a broader variety of journals, an increased threat of predatory journals, and new publishing models. This study updates and expands upon how medical education authors decide which journal to submit to with the aim of describing the motivational factors and journal characteristics that guide authors' decision making. Methods: The authors conducted five qualitative focus groups in which twenty-two medical education authors and editors participated. During the focus groups participants were engaged in a discussion about how they select a journal to submit their manuscripts. Audio from all focus groups was transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using codebook thematic analysis. Results: Participants considered multiple factors when selecting a target journal. Factors included a journal's impact, the scope of a journal, journal quality, and technical factors (e.g., word limits). Participants also described how social factors influenced their process and that open access plays a role that could both encourage or deter submission. Discussion: The findings describe the motivational factors and influential signals that guide authors in their journal selection decision making. These findings confirm, extend, and update journal selection factors reported in medical education and other disciplines. Notably, these findings emphasize the role of social factors, relationships and personal experiences, which were absent from previous work. Additionally, we observed increased consideration of OA and a shift away from an emphasis on journal prestige.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

The ability to synchronize movements requires 1) detecting a steady rhythmic pulse, or beat, out of a stream of complex sounds, 2) projecting this rhythmic pattern forward in time to predict future input, and 3) timing motor commands in anticipation of predicted future beats. Here, we demonstrate that the macaque is capable of synchronizing taps to a subjective beat in real music, and even spontaneously chooses to do so over alternative strategies. This contradicts the influential ""vocal learning hypothesis"" that musical beat synchronization is only possible in species with complex vocalizations such as humans and some songbirds. We propose an alternative view of musical beat perception and synchronization ability as a continuum onto which a wider range of species can be mapped depending on their ability to perform and coordinate the general abilities listed above through association with reward.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Since both ciliary structural and signaling proteins are trafficked via IFT, it has been challenging to decouple the contributions of IFT and cilia structure to neuronal responses. By acutely inhibiting IFT without altering cilia structure and vice versa, here we describe the differential roles of ciliary trafficking and sensory ending morphology in shaping chemosensory responses in C. elegans. We show that a minimum cilium length but not continuous IFT is necessary for a subset of responses in the ASH nociceptive neurons. In contrast, neither cilia nor continuous IFT are necessary for odorant responses in the AWA olfactory neurons. Instead, continuous IFT differentially modulates response dynamics in AWA. Upon acute inhibition of IFT, cilia-destined odorant receptors are shunted to ectopic branches emanating from the cilia base. Spatial segregation of receptors in these branches from a cilia-restricted regulatory kinase results in odorant desensitization defects, highlighting the importance of precise organization of signaling molecules at sensory endings in regulating response dynamics. We also find that adaptation of AWA responses upon repeated exposure to an odorant is mediated by IFT-driven removal of its cognate receptor, whereas adaptation to a second odorant is regulated via IFT-independent mechanisms. Our results reveal unexpected complexity in the contribution of IFT and cilia organization to the regulation of responses even within a single chemosensory neuron type, and establish a critical role for these processes in the precise modulation of olfactory behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

A phylogenetically diverse subset of extant cyanobacteria can perform photosynthesis with far-red light through a process called far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This phenotype is enabled by a cluster of ~20 genes, and involves the synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls f and d, together with paralogues of the ubiquitous photosynthetic machinery used in visible light. The FaRLiP gene cluster is present in diverse, environmentally important cyanobacterial groups but its origin, evolutionary history, and connection to early biotic environments have remained unclear. This study takes advantage of the recent increase in (meta)genomic data to clarify this issue; sequence data mining, metagenomic assembly, and phylogenetic tree networks were used to recover more than 600 new FaRLiP gene sequences, corresponding to 52 new gene clusters. These data enable high-resolution phylogenetics and - by relying on multiple gene trees, together with gene arrangement conservation - support FaRLiP appearing early in cyanobacterial evolution. Sampling information shows that considerable FaRLiP diversity can be observed in microbialites to the present day, and the process may have been associated with microbial mats and stromatolite formation in the early Paleoproterozoic. The ancestral FaRLiP cluster was reconstructed, revealing a conserved intergenic regulatory sequence that has been maintained for billions of years. Taken together, our results indicate that oxygenic photosynthesis using far-red light may have played a significant role in Earth's early history.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Although such host-induced gene silencing is well-documented, the molecular mechanisms by which RNAs can move from the cytoplasm of plant cells across the plasma membrane of both the host cell and fungal cell are poorly understood. Indirect evidence suggests that this RNA transfer may occur at a very early stage of the infection process, prior to breach of the host cell wall, suggesting that silencing RNAs might be secreted onto leaf surfaces. To assess whether Arabidopsis plants possess a mechanism for secreting RNA onto leaf surfaces, we developed a protocol for isolating leaf surface RNA separately from intercellular (apoplastic) RNA. This protocol yielded abundant leaf surface RNA that displayed an RNA banding pattern distinct from apoplastic RNA, suggesting that it may be secreted directly from the leaf surface rather than exuded through stomata or hydathodes. Notably, this RNA was not associated with either extracellular vesicles or protein complexes; however, RNA species longer than 100 nucleotides could be pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Pelleting was inhibited by the divalent cation chelator EGTA, suggesting that these RNAs may form condensates on the leaf surface. These leaf surface RNAs are derived almost exclusively from Arabidopsis, but come from diverse genomic sources, including rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, intergenic RNA, microRNAs, and small interfering RNAs, with tRNAs especially enriched. We speculate that endogenous leaf surface RNA plays an important role in the assembly of distinct microbial communities on leaf surfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

To benefit navigation, this representation must be dynamically related to surrounding locations. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal's path has been described in place cells, where the sequence of spikes within each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal's current location towards upcoming locations. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms as the animal approaches the choice point, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials. However, to bridge the animal's path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats, that within individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal's location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps were accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells with putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive gridxdirection cells. Sweeps extended into never-visited locations that were inaccessible to the animal and persisted during REM sleep. Sweep directions could be explained by an algorithm that maximizes cumulative coverage of surrounding space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left-right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient 'look-around' mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

However, the intricate process of cell differentiation poses challenges for directly applying current PI frameworks in somatic tissues. Here, we introduce a novel computational approach called single-cell phylodynamic explorer (scPhyloX), designed to model structured cell populations in various cell states, by leveraging single-cell phylogenetic trees to infer dynamics of tissue development and tumor evolution. Our comprehensive simulations demonstrate the high accuracy of scPhyloX across various biological scenarios. Application of scPhyloX to three real datasets of single-cell lineage tracing unveils novel insights into somatic dynamics, such as the overshoot of cycling stem cell populations in fly organ development, clonal expansion of multipotent progenitors of hematopoiesis during human aging, and pronounced subclonal selection in early colorectal tumorigenesis. Thus, scPhyloX is an innovative computational method for investigating the development and evolution of somatic tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

The aims of the study were to describe the epidemiology of confirmed ME/CFS cases and their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with British Columbia Generations Project (BCGP) participants who self-reported having CFS and population-based controls with no fatiguing illness. Participants completed the Symptoms Assessment Questionnaire, RAND 36-item Health Survey, and Phenotyping Questionnaire Short-form. These assessments enabled the identification and characterization of confirmed cases of ME/CFS. Those with self-reported diagnoses who did not meet study diagnosis of ME/CFS were subcategorized as non-ME/CFS cases. Results: We included 187 participants, 45.5% (n=85) self-reported cases and 54.5% (n=102) controls; 34% (n=29) of those who self-reported ME/CFS fulfilled diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The population prevalence rates were 1.1% and 0.4% for self-reported and confirmed ME/CFS cases respectively. Participants displayed significantly lower scores in all eight SF-36 domains compared to the other groups. Mental component scores were similar between ME/CFS and non-ME/CFS groups. The main risk factor for low HRQoL scores was fatigue severity ({beta} = -0.6, p<0.001 for physical health; {beta} = -0.7, p<0.001 for mental health). Conclusions: The majority of self-reported cases do not meet diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, suggesting that self-reported CFS may not be a reliable indicator for a true ME/CFS diagnosis. HRQoL indicators were consistently lower in ME/CFS and non-ME/CFS cases compared to controls, with ME/CFS cases having lower scores in most domains. Having higher symptom severity scores and perceived poorer health were the significant affecting factors of lower HRQoL. Although self-report can be used as screening to identify cases in populations, we suggest studies of ME/CFS should include appropriate medically confirmed clinical diagnosis for validity. Further large-scale population-based studies with simultaneous medical assessment are suggested to further characterize validity parameters of self-reported diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275581

Group 3 MB subtype accounts for about 25% of MB diagnoses and is associated with the most unfavorable outcomes. Herein, we report that more than half of group 3 MB tumors express melanoma antigens (MAGEs), which are potential prognostic and therapeutic markers. MAGEs are tumor antigens, expressed in several types of adult cancers and associated with poorer prognosis and therapy resistance; however, their expression in pediatric cancers is mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether MAGEs are activated in pediatric MB. Methods: To determine MAGE frequency in pediatric MB, we obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) samples of 34 patients, collected between 2008-2015, from the Children's Medical Center Dallas pathology archives and applied our validated reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay to measure the relative expression of 23 MAGE cancer-testis antigen genes. To validate our data, we analyzed several published datasets from pediatric MB patients and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, totaling 860 patients. We then examined how MAGE expression affects the growth and oncogenic potential of medulloblastoma cells by CRISPR-Cas9- and siRNA-mediated gene depletion. Results: Our RT-qPCR analysis suggested that MAGEs were expressed in group 3/4 medulloblastoma. Further mining of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets confirmed that 50-75% of group 3 tumors activate a subset of MAGE genes. Depletion of MAGEAs, B2, and Cs alter MB cell survival, viability, and clonogenic growth due to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Conclusions: These results indicate that targeting MAGEs in medulloblastoma may be a potential therapeutic option for group 3 medulloblastomas.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Here, we conducted comprehensive phylogenomics analyses with an expanded taxon sampling of early-branching protists including 22 newly sequenced transcriptomes (apusomonads, ancyromonads, Meteora). They support the monophyly of Opimoda, one of the largest eukaryotic supergroups, with CRuMs being sister to the Amorphea (amoebozoans, breviates, apusomonads, and opisthokonts - including animals and fungi-), and the ancyromonads+malawimonads clade. By mapping traits onto this phylogenetic framework, we infer a biflagellate opimodan ancestor with an excavate-like feeding groove. Breviates and apusomonads retained the ancestral biflagellate state. Other Amorphea lost one or both flagella, enabling the evolution of amoeboid shapes, novel feeding modes, and palintomic cell division resulting in multinucleated cells, which likely facilitated the subsequent evolution of fungal and metazoan multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

This has led the World Health Organization and the CDC to categorize MDR A. baumannii as a top priority for the research and development of new antibiotics. Colistin is the last-resort antibiotic to treat carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii. Not surprisingly, reintroduction of colistin has resulted in the emergence of colistin-resistant strains. Diclofenac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain and inflammation associated with arthritis. In this work, we show that diclofenac sensitizes colistin-resistant A. baumannii clinical strains to colistin, in vitro and in a murine model of pneumonia. Diclofenac also reduced the colistin MIC of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed an upregulation of oxidative stress-related genes and downregulation of type IV pili induced by the combination treatment. Notably, the concentrations of colistin and diclofenac effective in the murine model were substantially lower than those determined in vitro, implying a stronger synergistic effect in vivo compared to in vitro. A pilA mutant strain, lacking the primary component of the type IV pili, became sensitive to colistin in the absence of diclofenac. This suggest that the downregulation of type IV pili is key for the synergistic activity of these drugs in vivo and indicates that colistin and diclofenac exert an anti-virulence effect. Together, these results suggest that the diclofenac can be repurposed with colistin to treat MDR A. baumannii.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Using a transient expression system in tobacco leaves, we screened Arabidopsis transporter genes and isolated ATP-BINDING CASSETTE TRANSPORTER C4 (ABCC4). Further validation through drug-induced expression in Arabidopsis and heterologous expression in budding yeast revealed that ABCC4 effluxes the active form of cytokinins. During the seedling stage, ABCC4 was highly expressed in roots, and its expression was up-regulated in response to cytokinin application. Loss-of-function mutants of ABCC4 displayed enhanced primary root elongation, similar to mutants impaired in cytokinin biosynthesis or signaling, which was suppressed by exogenous trans-zeatin treatment. In contrast, overexpression of the gene led to suppression of root elongation. These results suggest that ABCC4 plays a role in the efflux of active cytokinin, thereby contributing to root growth regulation.

In addition, many pathogens activate multiple sensors and generate complex signals in a responding cell. How macrophages integrate multiple pathogen-associated signals into a coherent physiologic response is unclear. Upon entering a macrophage, M. tuberculosis (Mtb) induces proinflammatory cytokines that activate antibacterial responses. Surprisingly, it also triggers antiviral responses that actually hinder the host response to Mtb. The ubiquitin ligase CBL suppresses these antiviral responses and shifts macrophages toward a more antibacterial state during Mtb infection. However, the mechanisms by which CBL regulates immune signaling are unknown. We found that CBL broadly suppresses the expression of antiviral effector genes and then used quantitative mass-spectrometry to identify potential CBL substrates. We identified over 46,000 ubiquitylated sites in Mtb-infected macrophages, and subsequent analysis of CBL-deficient cells identified roughly 400 CBL-dependent ubiquitylation events, highlighting potential substrates. Using genetic interaction analysis of CBL and its putative substrates we identified the Fas associated factor 2 (FAF2) adapter protein as a key signaling molecule protein downstream of CBL.

Rab5-positive early endosomes receive proteins from the plasma membrane. Dependent on a ubiquitin mark on the protein, they will be either recycled or sorted into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) by ESCRT. During endosome maturation Rab5 will be replaced by Rab7 on endosomes that are able to fuse with lysosomes to form endolysosomes. Whether ESCRT-driven ILV formation and Rab5-to-Rab7 conversion are coordinated remains unknown. Here we show that loss of early ESCRTs leads to enlarged Rab5-positive endosomes and prohibit Rab conversion. Reduction of ubiquitinated cargo alleviated this phenotype. Moreover, ubiquitinated proteins on the endosomal limiting membrane prevented the displacement of the Rab5GEF RABX-5 by the Rab7GEF SAND-1/CCZ-1. Overexpression of Rab7 could partially overcome this block, even in the absence of SAND-1, whereby the HOPS complex presumably acts as Rab7GEF. Our data reveal a hierarchy of events in which cargo corralling by ESCRTs is upstream of Rab conversion and thereby ESCRT-0 and ubiquitinated cargo could act as timers determining the onset of Rab conversion.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Despite these advantages, concerns have arisen regarding potential degradation artifacts introduced by tagging systems due to the presence of lysine residues on them, prompting the development of alternative tools. In this study, we introduce HiBiT-RR and nLucK0, variants devoid of lysine residues, to mitigate such artifacts. Our findings demonstrate that HiBiT-RR maintains similar sensitivity and binding affinity with the original HiBiT. Moreover, the comparison between nLucWT and nLucK0 constructs reveals variations in degradation patterns induced by certain PROTAC molecules, emphasizing the importance of choosing appropriate tagging systems to ensure the reliability of experimental outcomes in studying protein degradation processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

This is despite some of these tools having been available for several decades, and being widely used for genome and transcriptome annotation. We perform an assessment of nucleotide sequence and alignment-based de novo protein-coding detection tools. The controls we use exclude any previous training dataset and include coding exons as a positive set and length-matched intergenic and shuffled sequences as negative sets. Our work demonstrates that several widely used tools are neither accurate nor computationally efficient for the protein-coding sequence detection problem. In fact, just three of nine tools significantly outperformed a naive scoring scheme. Furthermore, we note a high discrepancy between self-reported accuracies and the accuracy achieved in our study. Our results show that the extra dimension from conserved and variable nucleotides in alignments have a significant advantage over single sequence approaches. These results highlight significant limitations in existing protein-coding annotation tools that are widely used for lncRNA annotation. This shows a need for more robust and efficient approaches to training and assessing the performance of tools for identifying protein-coding sequences. Our study paves the way for future advancements in comparative genomic approaches and we hope will popularise more robust approaches to genome and transcriptome annotation.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) influences the functioning of these co-transporters. BDNF is synthesized from precursor proteins (proBDNF), which undergo proteolytic cleavage to yield mature BDNF (mBDNF). While previous studies have indicated the involvement of BDNF signaling in the activity of KCC2, its specific mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the interplay between both forms of BDNF and chloride homeostasis in rat hippocampal neurons and in-utero electroporated cortices of rat pups, spanning the behavioral, cellular, and molecular levels. We found that both pro- and mBDNF play a comparable role in immature neurons by inhibiting the capacity of neurons to extrude chloride. Additionally, proBDNF increases the endocytosis of KCC2 while maintaining a depolarizing shift of EGABA in maturing neurons. Behaviorally, proBDNF-electroporated rat pups in the somatosensory cortex exhibit sensory deficits delayed huddling and cliff avoidance. These findings emphasize the role of BDNF signaling in regulating chloride transport through the modulation of KCC2. In summary, this study provides valuable insights into the intricate interplay between BDNF, chloride homeostasis, and inhibitory synaptic transmission, shedding light on the underlying cellular mechanisms involved.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Depending on the assumptions modeled in stratified analyses, CCP was estimated to have saved between 16,187 and 66,160 lives. The ideal use of CCP might have saved as many as 215,195 lives while preventing 1,136,880 hospitalizations.

To study transcript expression throughout Caenorhabditis elegans embryogenesis at single-molecule resolution, we developed a high-throughput single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) method that relies on computational methods to developmentally stage embryos and quantify individual mRNA molecules in single embryos. We applied our system to sdc-2, a zygotically transcribed gene essential for hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation. We found that sdc-2 is rapidly activated during early embryogenesis by increasing both the number of mRNAs produced per transcription site and the frequency of sites engaged in transcription. Knockdown of sdc-2 and dpy-27, a subunit of the dosage compensation complex (DCC), increased the number of active transcription sites for the X chromosomal gene dpy-23 but not the autosomal gene mdh-1, suggesting that the DCC reduces the frequency of dpy-23 transcription. The temporal resolution from in silico staging of embryos showed that the deletion of a single DCC recruitment element near the dpy-23 gene causes higher dpy-23 mRNA expression after the start of dosage compensation, which could not be resolved using mRNAseq from mixed-stage embryos. In summary, we have established a computational approach to quantify temporal regulation of transcription throughout C. elegans embryogenesis and demonstrated its potential to provide new insights into developmental gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

Here, we have compiled 7873 proteomic samples measuring protein levels in 11 human tissues and use these to define an atlas with tissue-specific protein associations. This method recapitulates known protein complexes and the larger structural organization of the cell. Interactions of stable protein complexes are well preserved across tissues, while signaling and metabolic interactions show larger variation. Further, we find that less than 18% of differences between tissues are estimated to be due to differences in gene expression while cell-type specific cellular structures, such as synaptic components, represent a significant driver of differences between tissues. We further supported the brain protein association network through co-fractionation experiments in synaptosomes, curation of brain derived pull-down data and AlphaFold2 models.

In addition to the original population branch statistic (PBS), there are subsequently proposed branch rescalings: normalized population branch statistic (PBSn1), which adjusts focal branch length with respect to outgroup branch lengths at the same locus, and population branch excess (PBE), which also incorporates median branch lengths at other loci. PBSn1 and PBE have been proposed to be less sensitive to allele frequency divergence generated by background selection or geographically ubiquitous positive selection rather than local selective sweeps. However, the accuracy and statistical power of branch statistics have not been systematically assessed. To do so, we simulate genomes in representative large and small populations with varying proportions of sites evolving under genetic drift or background selection (approximated using variable Ne), local selective sweeps, and geographically parallel selective sweeps. We then assess the probability that local selective sweep loci are correctly identified as outliers by FST and by each of the branch statistics. We find that branch statistics consistently outperform FST at identifying local sweeps. When background selection and/or parallel sweeps are introduced, PBSn1 and especially PBE correctly identify local sweeps among their top outliers at a higher frequency than PBS. These results validate the greater specificity of rescaled branch statistics such as PBE to detect population-specific positive selection, supporting their use in genomic studies focused on local adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

How somatic and germ cells interact to develop and maintain fertility is not well understood. Here, using grafting experiments and transgenic reporter animals, we find that a specific part of the gonad-the germinal zone-acts as a sexual organizer to induce and maintain de novo germ cells and somatic gonads in non-sexual tissue in the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. We further show that germ cells express a novel member of the BMP family (Gonadless, Gls) that induces somatic gonad morphogenesis. Loss of Gls resulted in animals lacking somatic gonadal structures but having few, non-proliferative germ cells. We propose a model according to which a small number of primary germ cells drive gonad development though Gls morphogen secretion. The germinal zone in the newly formed gonad, in turn, provides positive feedback to induce secondary germ cells by activating Tfap2 (the master regulator of germ cell fate) in resident pluripotent stem cells. De novo induction of germ cells by gonads in adult life is absent in bilaterians with a sequestered germline. However, the contribution of germ cell signaling to the patterning of somatic gonadal tissue, as observed in Hydractinia, may be a general animal feature.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

CF is characterised by chronic lung inflammation and recurrent pulmonary infections that increase morbidity and premature mortality rates. The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) places further challenges on the treatment and management of CF, necessitating research into alternative strategies for treatment of bacterial infections . Bacteriophage therapy, involving bacterial-specific viruses, is a potential avenue for AMR infections in patients with CF. Existing literature supports the feasibility of phage therapy in CF but there has been a gap in investigating attitudes of the CF community including affected individuals and their caregivers, regarding phage therapy. Understanding perspectives and needs of the CF community is essential for successful implementation and acceptance of novel therapies including phage therapy. We conducted a survey that encompasses responses from 112 consumers from across Australia, comprising people living with CF (38.4%), parents of affected children (49.6%), carers (6.4%), and family members (3%). The findings showed a significant reliance on antibiotics with 51.4% requiring oral, 43.4% nebulised, and 11.4% intravenous (IV) antibiotics within the preceding 2 weeks. Respondents highlighted the availability of new treatments, duration of hospitalisations and costs associated with treatment as important priorities to address. Despite an awareness of phage therapy among 62.4% of respondents, 86.4% expressed interest in obtaining more information, primarily from medical staff (66.7%). Notably, 96.0% of respondents expressed willingness to participate in phage therapy trials. The results of this survey highlighted the CF community's strong interest in advanced therapeutic approaches, specifically phage therapy.

While the range of applications of inertial devices spans medical diagnostics, bioprocessing or water engineering to mention a few, translation is still impeded by the lack of clear understanding of cell interactions in such devices. This often leads to bespoke designs that take years of development and characterisation for one targeted application, and limited tools for informed optimisation. A more fundamental knowledge of inertial behaviours is key to future translational works and impact, by enabling a deeper understanding of inertial forces in biological systems. Towards this goal, this paper focuses on high-throughput morphological phenotyping of the single-celled, flagellated parasite Leishmania mexicana to better understand how variations in cell body length, width and flagellated status impact the focusing patterns of highly non-spherical cells in curved inertial devices. Some of the key findings in this study include: i) not all organelles, such as flagella, will alter focusing if the body shape is conserved, ii) the impact of cell shape is specific to a channel design and slight changes in e.g., cell confinement can completely change focusing patterns, iii) elongated prolate-like cells align in different orientations depending on their lateral position with a curved channel and iv) despite variabilities observed in focusing patterns for elongated versus rounder cell phenotypes, large morphological variations can be completely overcome at high Reynolds numbers so that all phenotypes tightly focus at a single position (here towards the channel outer wall). This last finding, in particular, may open new avenues for highly efficient cell enrichment processes, such as for the detection of pathogens in water.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US children?s hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification. Results: A total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups.

However, repetitive inclusion of a reporter gene is an incompressible cost and sometimes accounts for most of the synthesized DNA length. Here we present minireporters based on split-GFP systems that reassemble into functional fluorescent proteins and can be used to monitor gene expression in E. coli TXTL. The 135 bp GFP10-11 fragment produces a fluorescent signal comparable to its full-length GFP counterpart when reassembling with its complementary protein synthesized from the 535 bp fragment expressed in TXTL. We show that minireporters can be used to characterize promoter libraries, with data qualitatively comparable to full-length GFP, and matching with in vivo expression measurements. We also use minireporters as small fusion tags to measure TXTL protein and peptide production yield. Finally, we generalize our concept by providing a luminescent minireporter based on split-nanoluciferase. The ~80% gene sequence length reduction afforded by minireporters lowers synthesis costs and liberates space for testing larger devices while producing a reliable output. In the peptide production context, the small size of minireporters compared to full-length GFP is less likely to bias peptide solubility assays. We anticipate that minireporters will facilitate rapid and cost-efficient genetic device prototyping, protein production, and interaction assays.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

However, across neurodegenerative diseases, there is strong evidence for active involvement of immune cells like microglia in driving disease pathophysiology. Here, we demonstrate that tau mRNA and protein are expressed in microglia in human brains and in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia like cells (iMGLs). Using iMGLs harboring the MAPT IVS10+16 mutation and isogenic controls, we demonstrate that a tau mutation is sufficient to alter microglial transcriptional states. We discovered that MAPT IVS10+16 microglia exhibit cytoskeletal abnormalities, stalled phagocytosis, disrupted TREM2/TYROBP networks, and altered metabolism. Additionally, we found that secretory factors from MAPT IVS10+16 iMGLs impact neuronal health, reducing synaptic density in neurons. Key features observed in vitro were recapitulated in human brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid from MAPT mutations carriers. Together, our findings that MAPT IVS10+16 drives cell-intrinsic dysfunction in microglia that impacts neuronal health has major implications for development of therapeutic strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275581

In retrospective docking screens against the {sigma}2 and the 5-HT2A receptors, the AF2 structures struggled to recapitulate ligands that we had previously found docking against the receptors experimental structures, consistent with published results. Prospective large library docking against the AF2 models, however, yielded similar hit rates for both receptors versus docking against experimentally-derived structures; hundreds of molecules were prioritized and tested against each model and each structure of each receptor. The success of the AF2 models was achieved despite differences in orthosteric pocket residue conformations for both targets versus the experimental structures. Intriguingly, against the 5-HT2A receptor the most potent, subtype-selective agonists were discovered via docking against the AF2 model, not the experimental structure. To understand this from a molecular perspective, a cryoEM structure was determined for one of the more potent and selective ligands to emerge from docking against the AF2 model of the 5-HT2A receptor. Our findings suggest that AF2 models may sample conformations that are relevant for ligand discovery, much extending the domain of applicability of structure-based ligand discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

These neurological symptoms frequently persist for months (post-acute sequalae of COVID-19 or PASC). The molecular origins of neuro-COVID and how it contributes to PASC are unknown, however a growing body of research highlights that the self-assembly of protein fragments from SARS-CoV-2 into amyloid nanofibrils may play a causative role. Previously, we identified two fragments from the proteins Open Reading Frame 6 (ORF6) and ORF10 that self-assemble into neurotoxic amyloid assemblies. Here we further our understanding of the self-assembly mechanisms and nano-architectures formed by these fragments as well as performing a more in-depth study of the biological responses of co-cultured neurons. By solubilising the peptides in a fluorinated solvent we eliminate insoluble aggregates in the starting materials (seeds) that change the polymorphic landscape of the assemblies. The resultant assemblies are dominated by structures with higher free energies (e.g. ribbons and amorphous aggregates) that are less toxic to cultured neurons. We also show the first direct evidence of cellular uptake by viral amyloids. This work highlights the importance of understanding the polymorphic behaviour of amyloids particularly in the context of neuro-COVID and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275581

It is debated whether these differ based primarily on culturally specific, learned features, or if acoustical features can reliably distinguish them. We study the spectro-temporal modulation patterns of vocalizations produced by 369 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies across six continents. Specific ranges of spectral and temporal modulations, overlapping within categories and across societies, significantly differentiate speech from song. Machine-learning classification shows that this effect is cross-culturally robust, vocalizations being reliably classified solely from their spectro-temporal features across all 21 societies. Listeners unfamiliar with the cultures classify these vocalizations using similar spectro-temporal cues as the machine learning algorithm. Finally, spectro-temporal features are better able to discriminate song from speech than a broad range of other acoustical variables, suggesting that spectro-temporal modulation--a key feature of auditory neuronal tuning--accounts for a fundamental difference between these categories.

For each library, we tested one and two rounds of enrichment, and assessed performance compared to deep shotgun sequencing. We find that the ""Twist Ancient DNA"" assay provides robust enrichment of ~1.2M target SNPs without introducing allelic bias that may interfere with downstream population genetics analyses. Additionally, we show that pooling up to 4 sequencing libraries and performing two rounds of enrichment is both reliable and cost-effective for libraries with less than 27% endogenous DNA content. Above 38% endogenous content, a maximum of one round of enrichment is recommended for cost-effectiveness and to preserve library complexity.

Although it can be effective to search the entire map to find the best placement of a component, the process can be slow when the maps are large. However, frequently there is a well-founded hypothesis about where particular components are located. In such cases, a local search using a map subvolume will be much faster because the search volume is smaller, and more sensitive because optimizing the search volume for the rotation search step enhances signal-to-noise. A Fourier-space likelihood-based local search approach, based on the previously-published em_placement software, has been implemented in the new emplace_local program. Tests confirm that the local search approach enhances speed and sensitivity of the computations.

The Late Antique burial site of Hvar - Rado[s]evi[c], spanning the 3rd to 5th centuries, is located on the Croatian Dalmatian island of Hvar. Given the time frame and its location on a busy marine trade route, study of this burial site offers us a glimpse into the lives of the Late Antique population living on this island. It comprises 33 individuals, with 17 buried within a confined grave tomb, and the remaining individuals buried in separate locations in the tomb's proximity. Our objective was to provide new perspectives on the lives of people on the island during those times by studying ancestry, population structure, possible differences within the buried population, dietary habits, and general health. Analysis of the ancestral origins of the individuals buried at Hvar - Rado[s]evi[c] revealed a diverse population reflective of the era's genetic variability. The identification of genetic outliers suggests affiliations with distinct regions of the Roman Empire, possibly linked to trade routes associated with the Late Antique port in ancient Hvar. Stable isotope ratio analysis ({delta}13C and {delta}15N) indicated a diet mainly consisting of C3 plants, with minimal consumption of marine foods. High childhood mortality rates, physiological stress markers, and dental diseases suggest a low quality of life in the population.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275581

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, .1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275582

ObjectiveTo evaluate febrile seizure risk following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination among children aged 2-5 years.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe primary analysis evaluated children who had a febrile seizure outcome in the 0-1 days following COVID-19 vaccination. A self-controlled case series analysis was performed in three commercial insurance databases to compare the risk of seizure in the risk interval (0-1 days) to a control interval (8-63 days).

ExposureReceipt of dose 1 and/or dose 2 of monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was febrile seizure (0-1 day risk interval).

AnalysisA conditional Poisson regression model was used to compare outcome rates in risk and control intervals and estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analyses were used to pool results across databases.

ResultsThe primary meta-analysis found a statistically significant increased incidence of febrile seizure, in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 vaccination compared to the control interval (IRR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.69, risk difference (RD)/100,000 doses = 3.22 (95%CI -0.31 to 6.75)). For the BNT162b2 vaccination, the IRR was elevated but not statistically significant (IRR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.48 to 4.11, RD/100,000 doses = -0.25 (95%CI -2.75 to 2.24).

Conclusions and RelevanceAmong children aged 2-5 years, the analysis showed a small elevated incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures in the 0-1 days following the mRNA-1273 vaccination. Based on the current body of scientific evidence, the safety profile of the monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAmong children aged 2-5 years, is the risk of febrile seizure elevated immediately following monovalent COVID-19 mRNA vaccination compared with a later period after vaccination?

FindingsIn this self-controlled case series that included participants aged 2-5 years from three commercial insurance databases, the incidence rate ratio of febrile seizures was significantly elevated in the 0-1 days following mRNA-1273 administration. Absolute risk was small.

MeaningThe incidence of febrile seizures was elevated immediately following vaccination with the monovalent mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 2-5 years. Based on the current body of evidence, the safety profile of monovalent mRNA vaccines remains favorable for use in young children.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275582

Methods: We use a probabilistic framework to estimate the likelihood that novel influenza virus cases would be detected through testing in different community and healthcare settings (urgent care, emergency department, hospital, and intensive care unit (ICU)) while at low frequencies in the United States. Parameters were informed by data on seasonal influenza virus activity and existing testing practices. Results: In a baseline scenario reflecting the presence of 100 novel virus infections with similar severity to seasonal influenza viruses, the median probability of detecting at least one infection per month was highest in urgent care settings (72%) and when community testing was conducted at random among the general population (77%). However, urgent care testing was over 15 times more efficient (estimated as the number of cases detected per 100,000 tests) due to the larger number of tests required for community testing. In scenarios that assumed increased clinical severity of novel virus infection, median detection probabilities increased across all healthcare settings, particularly in hospitals and ICUs (up to 100%) where testing also became more efficient. Conclusions: Our results suggest that novel influenza virus circulation is likely to be detected through existing healthcare surveillance, with the most efficient testing setting impacted by the disease severity profile. These analyses can help inform future testing strategies to maximize the likelihood of novel influenza detection.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275582

While RdRp is the target of several viral inhibitors, the active site has several pitfalls when translating in vitro inhibitors to the clinic. The highly polar residues within the active site often necessitate the use of highly polar or charged compounds, especially when designing nucleoside analog inhibitors, posing significant challenges in optimizing drug-likeness and membrane permeability for clinical efficacy. Here, we investigated the broad-spectrum potential of the allosteric Thumb-1 cryptic site of the RdRp, which to date has only been adequately studied in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). To explore this potential antiviral target, we used a suite of bioinformatics techniques, including homology modeling and multiple sequence alignments, to reveal the conserved landscape of the Thumb-1 site across +ssRNA viruses. We then used ChemPrint, our Mol-GDL (Molecular-Geometric Deep Learning) machine learning model to predict drug inhibition of the Thumb-1 site in RdRp across +ssRNA viruses. Here, we identify MDL-001 as a promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidate with favorable properties that enable oral and once-a-day dosing. We also show how the cryptic nature of the Thumb-1 site masks itself to conventional virtual screening techniques, like docking, where activity prediction is heavily based on solving or predicting an accurate structure of the open pocket. This study demonstrates the utility of this approach in drug discovery for broad-spectrum antivirals that target the Thumb-1 site.

Lay SummaryO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSThis paper addresses the challenge of developing broad-spectrum antivirals against +ssRNA viruses, which include pathogens like HCV and SARS-CoV-2. The highly conserved RdRp Thumb-1 site across these viruses is identified as a potential target for broad spectrum antiviral drugs, which would be vital tools in prophylactic and therapeutic responses to future viral threats.

MethodologyUtilizing bioinformatics and deep learning (through our proprietary AI platform called GALILEO), the study maps the conserved landscape of the RdRp Thumb-1 site across a range of human pathogenic +ssRNA viruses and screens for potential inhibitory compounds.

Key DiscoveriesMDL-001 emerges as a potential broad-spectrum non-nucleoside antiviral drug candidate and the RdRp Thumb-1 site exists as a family of targets, many of which may be targetable by a single drug.

Impact and ImplicationsThe discovery that the Thumb-1 site of RdRp can be targeted by small molecules for antiviral activity against a range of +ssRNA viruses.

DesignThis case series study analyzed adverse event (AE) reports submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database following RSVPreF immunization from September 1, 2023, to February 23, 2024.

SettingVAERS, as a national spontaneous vaccine safety surveillance system, provides insights into the safety profile of the RSVPreF vaccine in a real-world setting.

ParticipantsSurveillance data included all AE reports submitted to VAERS for pregnant individuals following vaccination.

ExposureReceipt of RSVPreF vaccine among pregnant individuals in the U.S.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresDescriptive statistics assessed all AE reports with RSVPreF, including frequency, gestational age at vaccination, time to AE onset, and serious report proportions. The Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) was utilized, estimating the information component (IC) to identify disproportionate reporting of RSVPreF-event pairs.

ResultsVAERS received 77 reports pertained to RSVPreF vaccination in pregnant individuals, with 42 (54.55%) classified as serious. The most reported non-pregnancy-specific AEs were headache, injection site erythema, and injection site pain. Preterm birth was the most frequently reported pregnancy-specific AE, followed by preterm premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, cervical dilatation, and hemorrhage during pregnancy. The median time from immunization to reported preterm birth was 3 days, with two-thirds of cases within a week. Disproportionality analysis indicated a significant signal for various AEs, particularly highlighting preterm birth with an IC of 2.18 (95%CI, 1.54-2.63), suggesting that reports of preterm birth associated with RSVPreF vaccination occurred more frequently than statistically expected.

ConclusionsWhile reported AEs were generally consistent with the safety profile observed in prelicensure studies, this study highlights ongoing concern about preterm birth among pregnant individuals following RSVPreF vaccination. Comprehensive longitudinal follow-up, including prospective pregnancy registries and infant follow-up studies is urgently required.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275582

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275582

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275582

Recent research has highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychoactive substances and especially 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in alleviating trauma symptoms in chronic patients. However, little is known regarding the consequences of trauma that is acutely experienced under the influence of psychoactive substances. Here we investigated the acute experiences and peritraumatic processing of 657 survivors from the high-casualty terror attack at the Supernova music festival in Israel on October 7th, 2023. Data were collected four to twelve weeks following the TE. Approximately two-thirds of survivors were under the influence of psychoactive substances at the time of the TE, offering a tragic and unique natural experiment on the impact of psychoactive compounds on TE processing. Our findings reveal that individuals who experienced the trauma while under the influence of MDMA demonstrated significantly improved intermediate outcomes compared to those who were under the influence of other substances or no substances at all. Specifically, the MDMA group reported increased feelings of social support, more social interactions and enhanced quality of sleep during the peritraumatic period, yielding reduced levels of mental distress and reduced PTSD symptom severity. These novel findings suggest that the influence of MDMA during the TE may carry protective effects into the peritraumatic period, possibly mediated through the known effects of MDMA in reducing negative emotions and elevating prosociality. These protective effects in turn may mitigate the development of early psychopathology-related symptoms. Current preliminary results underscore the need for further understanding of the cognitive and physiological processes by which psychedelic substances intersect with trauma recovery processes.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275582

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275582

These viruses have spread across the Americas causing morbidity and mortality in both wild and domestic birds as well as some mammalian species, including cattle. Many surveillance programs in wildlife as well as commercial poultry operations have detected these viruses. Here we conducted surveillance of avian species in the urban environment in New York City. We detected highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses in six samples from four different bird species and performed full genome sequencing. Sequence analysis showed the presence of multiple different genotypes. Our work highlights that the interface between animals and humans that may give rise to zoonotic infections or even pandemics is not limited to rural environments and commercial poultry operations but extends into the heart of our urban centers.

ImportanceWhile surveillance for avian influenza viruses is often focused on migratory routes and their associated stop-over locations, or commercial poultry operations, many bird species - including migratory birds - frequent or live in urban green spaces and wetlands. This brings them into contact with a highly dense population of humans and pets providing an extensive urban animal-human interface in which the general public may have little awareness of circulating infectious diseases.

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1716156275582

Provided that the target complexes may be localised in noisy, three-dimensional tomographic reconstructions, averaging images of multiple instances of these molecules can lead to structures with sufficient resolution for de novo atomic modelling. Although many research groups have contributed image processing tools for these tasks, a lack of standardisation and inter-operability represents a barrier for newcomers to the field. Here, we present an image processing pipeline for electron tomography data in RELION-5, with functionality ranging from the import of unprocessed movies to the automated building of atomic models in the final maps. Our explicit definition of metadata items that describe the steps of our pipeline has been designed for inter-operability with other software tools and provides a framework for further standardisation.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275582

Stress-induced exposure of ribosome-free mRNA following translational shutoff is thought to cause condensation by allowing new multivalent RNA-dependent interactions, with RNA length and associated interaction capacity driving increased condensation. Here we show that, in striking contrast, virtually all mRNA species condense in response to multiple unrelated stresses in budding yeast, length plays a minor role, and instead, stress-induced transcripts are preferentially excluded from condensates, enabling their selective translation. Using both endogenous genes and reporter constructs, we show that translation initiation blockade, rather than resulting ribosome-free RNA, causes condensation. These translation initiation-inhibited condensates (TIICs) are biochemically detectable even when stress granules, defined as microscopically visible foci, are absent or blocked. TIICs occur in unstressed yeast cells, and, during stress, grow before the appearance of visible stress granules. Stress-induced transcripts are excluded from TIICs primarily due to the timing of their expression, rather than their sequence features. Together, our results reveal a simple system by which cells redirect translational activity to newly synthesized transcripts during stress, with broad implications for cellular regulation in changing conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275582

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1716156275582
