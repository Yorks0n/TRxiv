Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Domestic cats are susceptible to AIV infection and provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of AIV infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We identified 607 AIV infections in felines, including 302 associated deaths, comprising 18 countries and 12 felid species. We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b. We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

Combining cryo-PFIB sample preparation with recent advances in cryo-ET data acquisition and processing, we generated a dataset of 1829 reconstructed and annotated tomograms, which we provide as a community resource to drive method development and inspire biological discovery. To assay the quality of this dataset, we performed subtomogram averaging (STA) of both soluble and membrane-bound complexes ranging in size from >3 MDa to [~]200 kDa, including 80S ribosomes, Rubisco, nucleosomes, microtubules, clathrin, photosystem II, and mitochondrial ATP synthase.

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

Because these RBD sequences did not match known circulating strains and their source was not known, we termed them ""cryptic lineages"". To date, more than 20 cryptic lineages have been identified using the RBD-focused sequencing strategy. Here, we identified and characterized additional cryptic lineages from SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequences submitted to NCBIs Sequence Read Archives (SRA). Wastewater sequence datasets were screened for individual sequence reads that contained combinations of mutations frequently found in cryptic lineages but not contemporary circulating lineages. Using this method, we identified 18 cryptic lineages that appeared in multiple samples from the same sewershed, including 12 that were not previously reported. Partial consensus sequences were generated for each cryptic lineage by extracting and mapping sequences containing cryptic-specific mutations. Surprisingly, seven of the mutations that appeared convergently in cryptic lineages were reversions to sequences that were highly conserved in SARS- CoV-2-related bat Sarbecoviruses. The apparent reversion to bat Sarbecovirus sequences suggests that SARS- CoV-2 adaptation to replicate efficiently in respiratory tissues preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.

Author SummaryWastewater surveillance has been used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to monitor viral activity and the spread of viral lineages. Occasionally, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from wastewater reveal unique evolutionary advanced lineages of SARS-CoV-2 from an unknown source, which are termed cryptic lineages. Many groups nationwide also use wastewater surveillance to track the virus and upload that information to NCBIs SRA database. That sequence data was screened to identify 18 cryptic lineages worldwide and identify convergent mutations throughout the genome of multiple cryptic lineages that suggest reversion to residues common in SARS-CoV-2-related Sarbecoviruses.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

While ML algorithms are proficient in general-purpose tasks, their highly technical nature often hinders their compatibility with the observed biological principles and constraints in the brain, thereby limiting their suitability for neuroscience applications. In this work, we introduce NeuroTorch, a comprehensive ML pipeline specifically designed to assist neuroscientists in leveraging ML techniques using biologically inspired neural network models. NeuroTorch enables the training of recurrent neural networks equipped with either spiking or firing-rate dynamics, incorporating additional biological constraints such as Dale's law and synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance. The pipeline offers various learning methods, including backpropagation through time and eligibility trace forward propagation, aiming to allow neuroscientists to effectively employ ML approaches. To evaluate the performance of NeuroTorch, we conducted experiments on well-established public datasets for classification tasks, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Heidelberg. Notably, NeuroTorch achieved accuracies that replicated the results obtained using the Norse and SpyTorch packages. Additionally, we tested NeuroTorch on real neuronal activity data obtained through volumetric calcium imaging in larval zebrafish. On training sets representing 9.3 minutes of activity under darkflash stimuli from 522 neurons, the mean proportion of variance explained for the spiking and firing-rate neural network models, subject to Dale's law, exceeded 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Our analysis of networks trained on these datasets indicates that both Dale's law and spiking dynamics have a beneficial impact on the resilience of network models when subjected to connection ablations. NeuroTorch provides an accessible and well-performing tool for neuroscientists, granting them access to state-of-the-art ML models used in the field without requiring in-depth expertise in computer science.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, little is known about how the brain may reconcile the ability to produce hardwired responses essential to survival while still allowing for adaptive flexibility. Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses, an innate predator-evasion behaviour, can be robustly extinguished via repeated unreinforced presentation over several days. We report that this extinction is long-lasting and generalises to other contexts, but can be rapidly recovered via the pairing of the visual stimulus with an aversive electric foot-shock stimulus. Moreover, fiber photometric recordings reveal that this behavioural paradigm results in the attenuation of SC and PAG physiological responses to visual looming stimuli, and that these responses do not recover following recovery of behavioural responses. An analysis of c-Fos expression patterns throughout the midbrain and hippocampus uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned visual looming fear responses. We investigate the functional significance of this vCA1 ensemble and report that, while its activity is not necessary for innate defensive behaviour, it is necessary for learned fear responses. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in enabling adaptive behavioural responses to the innately threatening visual looming stimulus which acts in complement with innate circuitry of the SC and PAG.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, several emerging JN.1 sublineages, such as LF.7.2.1, MC.10.1, NP.1, and, especially, LP.8.1, have demonstrated superior growth advantages compared to XEC. It is critical to access the virological and antigenic characteristics of these emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we found that LF.7.2.1 is significantly more immune invasive than XEC, primarily due to the A475V mutation, which enabled the evasion of Class 1 neutralizing antibodies. However, LF.7.2.1s weak ACE2 binding affinity substantially impaired its fitness. Likewise, MC.10.1 and NP.1 exhibited strong antibody immune evasion due to the A435S mutation, but their limited ACE2 engagement efficiency restricted their growth advantage, suggesting that A435S may regulate the Spike conformation, similar to the NTD glycosylation mutations found in KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Most importantly, we found that LP.8.1 showed comparable humoral immune evasion to XEC but demonstrated much increased ACE2 engagement efficiency, supporting its rapid growth. These findings highlight the trade-off between immune evasion and ACE2 engagement efficiency in SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and underscore the importance of monitoring LP.8.1 and its descend lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, whether tempo is responsible for these differences in magnitude, and how, remains to be determined. Here, we used brain organoids to investigate this and observed that human axon tracts spend more time growing and extend farther compared to those of mice, independent of their tissue environment. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis pointed to a subset of calcium-permeable ion channels expressed throughout neuron development, including during axon tract outgrowth. Calcium imaging during early neuron development consistently revealed a reduced calcium influx in human neurons compared to mouse neurons. Stimulating calcium influx and increasing cAMP levels resulted in premature halting of axon tract outgrowth and shorter axon tracts, mimicking the mouse phenotype, while abrogating calcium influx led to an even longer phase of axon tract outgrowth and longer axon tracts in humans. Thus, evolutionary differences in calcium regulation set the tempo of neuronal development, by extending the time window to foster the more elaborated human neuron morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

These 3D stem cell-derived models exist in a newer space at the intersection of in vivo and 2D in vitro models. Functional benchmarking has so far remained largely uncharacterised however, leaving the extent to which these models may accurately portray in vivo processes still yet to be fully realised. Here we present a standardised unguided protocol to generate brain organoids from mice, the most commonly-used in vivo mammalian model; and in parallel establish a guided protocol for generating region-specific choroid plexus mouse organoids. Both unguided and guided mouse organoids progress through neurodevelopmental stages with an in vivo-like tempo and recapitulate species-specific characteristics of neural and choroid plexus development, respectively. Neuroepithelial cells generate neural progenitors that give rise to different neural subtypes including deep-layer neurons, upper-layer neurons, and glial cells. We further adapted protocols to prolong mouse cerebral organoid (CO) cultures as slices at the air-liquid interface (ALI), enhancing accessibility for long-term studies and functional investigations. In mature mouse ALI-COs, we observed mature glia, as well as synaptic structures and long-range axon tracts projecting to distant regions, suggesting an establishment and maturation of neural circuitry. Indeed, functional analyses with high-density multi-electrode arrays (HD-MEAs) indicate comparable activity to ex vivo organotypic mouse brain slices. Having established protocols for both region-specific and unpatterned mouse brain organoids, we demonstrate that their neurodevelopmental trajectories, and resultant mature features, closely mimic the in vivo models to which they are benchmarked across multiple biochemical, morphological, and functional read-outs. We propose that mouse brain organoids are a valuable model for functional studies, and provide insight into how closely brain organoids of other species, such as human, may recapitulate their own respective in vivo development.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

We present a novel approach to overcome this bias using a chemical chromatin restoration (CHR) treatment. This method restores transcriptional programs, chromatin accessibility, histone modification profiles, and differentiation potential, effectively recapitulating the competent anterior epiblast-like state. Furthermore, we propose that a high bivalency state is a defining feature of the anterior human epiblast.

We show that DNMT3A2/3B3 preferentially binds di-nucleosomes separated by short DNA linkers by inducing large-scale changes to the di-nucleosome structure, enabling each DNMT3B3 subunit to bind each nucleosome. Linker length and the position of cytosines within the linker control DNA methylation, indicating that a significant fraction of linkers in chromatin are naturally resistant to DNMT3A2/3B3 activity.

Identifying active ingredients requires access to detailed intervention descriptions, such as from trial protocols or manuals. We conducted a large-scale survey of the accessibility of trial protocols or manuals for evidence-based psychological interventions, tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for multiple mental disorders. Methods: We assembled a large cohort of RCTs, selecting these from six large network meta-analyses of psychological interventions for severe mental disorders (schizophrenia and other psychotic, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa). For each trial and active intervention arm, we used a multipronged approach (published protocol, trial registries, author contact, commercial availability) to identify protocols or manuals. We described, by trial and by active intervention arm, the proportion for which protocols or manuals were (1) accessible, i.e., retrievable by any method, and (2) publicly available. Findings: We included 260 RCTs, with 401 active intervention arms. Of these, 20 RCTs (8%, 95% confidence interval/CI 5% to 12%) were associated to protocols, published separately or as supplement. For the remaining 240 trials, we contacted 450 authors. Authors shared protocols for 43 trials (18%, 95% CI 13% to 23%), refused to share for 73 (30%, 95% CI 25% to 37%) and did not respond for 101 (42%, 95% CI 36% to 49%). Protocols or manuals were retrievable for 318 (79%, 95% CI 75% to 83%) and publicly available for 88 (22%, 95% CI 18% to 26%) active intervention arms, respectively. Conclusions: Access to detailed descriptions of psychological interventions, even using multiple methods, is difficult and burdensome, hampering much-needed examinations of treatment components. Relying only on open-access resources and sharing from authors, a researcher would be able to access about one third of trial protocols or manuals. Improving dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments requires publicly available treatment manuals.

Emerging work suggests that the thalamus, the relay center of the brain that undergoes secondary damage after cortical TBI, is involved with heightened seizure risks after TBI. TBI also induces the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, to the site(s) of injury, but it is unclear how these cells impact neurological sequelae post-TBI. Here, we characterize the identities and kinetics of lymphocytic infiltrates into the cortex and thalamus using a mouse model of cortical TBI. We identify a population of IFN{gamma}-producing type 1 lymphocytes that infiltrate specific thalamic subregions over weeks following injury, where they elicit a local IFN{gamma} response in microglia and neuronal subset(s). Depletion of CD4+ T cells protects mice from TBI-induced seizure susceptibility by de-repressing other non-CD4+ type 1 lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia (DAMs) in the thalamus. Strikingly, we find that a single dose of IFN{gamma} prior to challenge with a proconvulsant agent was sufficient to reduce TBI-induced seizure incidence, severity, and mortality. This work identifies IFN{gamma} as a direct modulator of TBI-associated seizure susceptibility, which could have therapeutic implications for the treatment of TBI patients.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

It describes the deviations of connectivity patterns from those expected in randomly connected networks. Understanding the origins of wiring specificity in neural networks remains difficult as a variety of generative mechanisms could have contributed to the observed connectome. To take a step forward, we propose a generative modeling framework that operates directly on dense connectome data as provided by saturated reconstructions of neural tissue. The computational framework allows testing different assumptions of synaptic specificity while accounting for anatomical constraints posed by neuron morphology, which is a known confounding source of wiring specificity. We evaluated the framework on dense reconstructions of the mouse visual and the human temporal cortex. Our template model incorporates assumptions of synaptic specificity based on cell type, single-cell identity, and subcellular compartment. Combinations of these assumptions were sufficient to model various connectivity patterns that are indicative of wiring specificity. Moreover, the identified synaptic specificity parameters showed interesting similarities between both datasets, motivating further analysis of wiring specificity across species.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Although different biochemical mechanisms are proposed, due to the dearth of direct force measurements, how mechanical forces determine the competition outcome remains unclear. Here, using ex vivo tissues and different cell lines, we have discovered an unknown form of cell competition that is regulated by differences in force transmission capabilities, favoring cell types with stronger intercellular adhesion. Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits a higher resistance to elimination while benefiting from efficient force transmission to neighboring cells. This cell elimination mechanism could have broad implications of keeping strong force transmission ability for maintaining tissue boundaries and cell invasion pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Ion uptake into condensates directly follows binding affinities, resulting in selective uptake of strong-binding ions, but exclusion of weak-binding ions. Ion binding further shapes the condensate microenvironment by altering the composition, viscosity and interface potential. Such changes can have profound effects on biochemical processes taking place inside condensates, as we show for RNA duplex formation. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of condensate-ion interactions in cellular bio- and electrochemistry and may aid design of condensate-targeting therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

We revealed PopZs hierarchical assembly into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations.

However, how the genetic sex shapes the molecular architecture of the nervous system at a single neuron level is still unknown. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the transcriptome of the sex-shared nervous system of adult male and hermaphrodite Caenorhabditis elegans. By ranking neurons based on the degree of molecular dimorphism, we uncover novel sexually dimorphic neurons such as PLM neurons, where functional dimorphism was corroborated by diminished posterior touch responses in hermaphrodites. We identify sex-specific regulators of mechanosensory behavior and neuronal function by combining our dataset with reverse genetic screens. While most sex-shared neurons retain their neurotransmitter identity, the male neuropeptide connectome undergoes substantial remodeling, with most of the neuropeptides showing a male-bias expression. This reinforces the notion that neuropeptides are crucial for diversifying connectome outputs. Furthermore, by correlating gene expression with outgoing synaptic connectivity, we identified regulatory candidates for synaptic wiring, including both shared and sex-specific genes. This comprehensive resource provides foundational insights into the molecular drivers of sexual dimorphism, facilitating future exploration of regulatory mechanisms and their impact on sex-specific behaviors in higher organisms.

Furthermore, gene editing, reporter lines and protein overexpression implicate the stomatal transcription factor MUTE in facilitating additional rounds of asymmetric divisions that form SCs in succulents.

While this period of beta cell dysfunction is well established, its cause and underlying mechanism remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, live human pancreas tissue slices were prepared from autoantibody-negative organ donors without diabetes (ND), donors positive for one or more islet autoantibodies (AAb+), and donors with T1D within 0-4 years of diagnosis (T1D+). Dynamic imaging and physiological secretion studies were conducted to assess the extent and impact of T cell infiltration on beta cell function through immunolabeling, Ca2+ imaging, and perifusion assays for insulin secretion. Beta cells were identified in living slices by ENTPD3 cell surface staining. Beta cells from both ND and AAb+ donors exhibited normal cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization in response to high glucose and KCl. Beta cells from donors with T1D had significantly diminished Ca2+ responses to high glucose but preserved responses to KCl. In T1D, glucose responsiveness was impaired in both T cell-infiltrated and non-infiltrated insulin positive islets, supporting the concept that beta cell dysfunction is independent of close spatial association between beta cells and T cells. Fixed tissue staining and gene expression profiling of laser-capture microdissected islets revealed significant decreases in markers of glucose metabolism to ATP in beta cells from donors with T1D but no changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. From these data, we posit that functional defects occur in beta cells during T1D pathogenesis independent of local T cell infiltration and beta cell destruction. Additionally, these beta cell metabolic defects contribute to the clinical manifestation of dysglycemia at T1D diagnosis despite a remaining mass of beta cells.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Here, we study a model of duplication-selection interaction, which is related to Haigh's mutation-selection model of Muller's ratchet. New gene copies are generated by duplication but fitness of individuals decreases as copy number increases. Our model comes in two flavours: duplicates are copied either from a single template or from any existing copy. A duplication-selection equilibrium exists in both cases for infinite size populations and is given by a shifted Poisson or a negative binomial distribution. Unless counteracted by synergistic epistasis, finite populations suffer from loss of low copy-number haplotypes by drift, forcing them into a regime called 'run-away evolution' in which new copies accumulate without bound nor equilibrium. We discuss a few empirical examples and interpret them in the light of our models. Generally, large gene families appear too overdispersed to fit the single template model suggesting a dynamic, and potentially accelerating, duplication process.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood.

This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs <35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of >200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p<0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p<0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p<0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.

Author SummaryOpportunistic antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emerging from the natural environment are an increasing threat, particularly for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections increase disease severity, the number of deaths and healthcare costs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in this context, causing long-term infections, yet the mechanisms driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung are not understood.

We investigated the adaptations of P. aeruginosa exposed to low oxygen conditions (an important environmental pressure in the CF lung), for 28 days, to examine whether it drives the process of persistence. We found that prolonged exposure to hypoxia induced changes in the pathogens characteristics, which were distinct from those reported after short term exposure. We observed multiple adaptations in hypoxia adapted cultures, many of which were associated with important signalling networks linked to lifestyle shifts in most bacteria and several of them are also observed in isolates that had adapted to chronic infection. Similar adaptive responses in other opportunistic environmental pathogens suggest that this adaptation could be targeted to create universal therapeutic approaches preventing antibiotic overuse and improving patient outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Here we show that, during the early stages of tumor development, TLS formation relies on IFN{gamma}-driven maturation of the conventional DC type 1 (cDC1) subset, their migration to tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLN), and recruitment of activated T cells to the tumor site. As tumors progress, TLS maintenance becomes independent of T cell egress from tdLN, coinciding with a significant reduction of cDC1 migration to tdLN. Instead, mature cDC1 accumulate within intratumoral CCR7 ligand-enriched stromal hubs. Notably, timed depletion of cDC1 or disruption of their migration to these stromal hubs after TLS are formed alters TLS maintenance. Importantly, we found that cDC1-mediated antigen presentation to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and intact CD40 signaling, is critical for the maintenance of TLS, the preservation of the TFH cell pool, the formation of germinal center and the production of tumor-specific IgG antibodies. These findings underscore the key role of mature cDC1 in establishing and maintaining functional TLS within tumor lesions and highlight the potential for cDC1-targeting therapies as a promising strategy to enhance TLS function and improve anti-tumor immunity in patients with cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Here we consider a ""standard admixture"" model that assumes the admixed populations are unrelated and also a generalized model, where the admixed populations themselves are related via coancestry (or covariance) of allele frequencies. The generalized model yields a potentially more realistic and substantially more flexible model that we call ""super admixture"". This super admixture model provides a one-to-one mapping in terms of probability moments with the population-level kinship model, the latter of which is a general model of genome-wide relatedness and structure based on identity-by-descent. We introduce a method to estimate the super admixture model that is based on method of moments, does not rely on likelihoods, is computationally efficient, and scales to massive sample sizes. We apply the method to several human data sets and show that the admixed populations are indeed substantially related, implying the proposed method captures a new and important component of evolutionary history and structure in the admixture model. We show that the fitted super admixture model estimates relatedness between all pairs of individuals at a resolution similar to the kinship model. The super admixture model therefore provides a tractable, forward generating probabilistic model of complex structure and relatedness that should be useful in a variety of scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Here, we developed a series of red fluorescent G protein-coupled receptor activation-based (GRAB) ACh sensors, with a wide detection range and expanded spectral profile. The high-affinity sensor, rACh1h, reliably detects ACh release in various brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex. Moreover, rACh1h can be co-expressed with green fluorescent sensors in order to record ACh release together with other neurochemicals in various behavioral contexts using fiber photometry and two-photon imaging, with high spatiotemporal resolution.

In cultured cells, chemical-mediated control of Cas9 activity can limit off-target effects and enable mechanistic study of essential genes. However, widely-used Tet-On systems often show ""leaky"" Cas9 expression, leading to unintended edits, as well as weak activity upon induction. Leakiness can be distinctly problematic in the context of Cas9 nuclease activity, which may result in cumulative DNA damage and degradation of the target cell genome over time. To overcome these deficiencies, we established transgenic platforms that minimize Cas9 functionality in the off-state along with maximized and uncompromised on-state gene editing efficiency. By combining conditional destabilization and inhibition of Cas9, we developed an all-in-one (one or multiple guide RNAs and Cas9) ultra-tight, Tet-inducible system with exceptional dynamic range (on vs. off-state) across various cell lines and targets. As an alternative to Tet-mediated induction, we created a branaplam-regulated splice switch module for low-baseline and robust Cas9 activity control. Lastly, for circumstances where DNA damage needs to be avoided, we constructed a dual-control, Tet-inducible CRISPRi module for tight and potent transcriptional silencing. This upgraded suite of inducible CRISPR systems has broad applications for numerous cell types and experimental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

Substances containing microbes-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are representative inducers of pathogen resistance and damage repair, thus treatment of healthy plants with such substances can pre-activate plant immunity and cell repair functions. In this study, the effects of DAMP/MAMP oligosaccharides mixture (Oligo-Mix) derived from plant cell wall (cello-oligosaccharide and xylo-oligosaccharide), and fungal cell wall (chitin-oligosaccharide) were examined in cucumber. Treatment of cucumber with Oligo-Mix promoted root germination and plant growth, along with increased chlorophyll contents in the leaves. Oligo-Mix treatment also induced typical defense responses such as MAP kinase activation and callose deposition in leaves. Pretreatment of Oligo-Mix enhanced disease resistance of cucumber leaves against pathogenic fungi Podosphaera xanthii (powdery mildew) and Colletotrichum orbiculare (anthracnose). Oligo-Mix treatment increased the induction of hypersensitive cell death around the infection site of pathogens, which inhibited further infection and the conidial formation of pathogens on the cucumber leaves. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Oligo-Mix treatment upregulated genes associated with plant structural reinforcement, responses to abiotic stresses and plant defense. These results suggested that Oligo-Mix has beneficial effects on growth and disease resistance in cucumber, making it a promising biostimulant for agricultural application.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, challenges persist in workflow integration, compliance, and widespread adoption. This study leveraged a Learning Health System (LHS) framework to align research and operations using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation protocol, embedded as pragmatic trial operations within the electronic health record (EHR).

MethodsAn alpha phase was conducted to pilot technical integration, refine workflows, and determine sample size in planning for a beta phase designed as a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) as primary outcome. During alpha, bi-directional governance was established between IS operations and LHS team with multidisciplinary workgroups for analytics, technical, documentation, and user experience. Ambient AI was embedded into the EHR using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), with real-time data dashboards tracking utilization and documentation accuracy for operations and research. Performance metrics were monitored serially using a difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis to detect drift caused by software workflow changes.

ResultsThe alpha phase, designed as Type 1 Hybrid, informed a 24-week beta phase stepped-wedge trial with 90% power to detect changes in PFI. Across the alpha phase, the weighted median of average provider Ambient AI utilization was 65.4% following Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles addressing organizational feasibility and task-dependent adoption. Diagnosis code accuracy dropped from 79% to 35% (p < 0.01) during alpha but recovered with a new note template and provider training. DiD did not detect significant drifts in work outside of work or time in notes two weeks before and after the new note template. Beta phase enrollment achieved its targeted 66 providers across eight specialties, initiating on schedule.

Conclusions and RelevanceWe provide a novel playbook for integrating Generative AI platforms in healthcare, combining pragmatic trial operations, human-centered design, and real-time monitoring to advance evidence-based implementation.

Our results show that temperature and productivity played the most important role in driving ecosystem changes in the study area at different times: temperature was the primary driver during MIS 21 interglacial, whereas productivity became a dominant factor in the MIS 19 interglacial. In addition, organism responses varied across the ecosystem. Both interglacials yielded higher plankton and benthos biomasses. However, for fishes, the responses differ. The early MIS 21 abrupt global warming, which was also captured by our record, probably led to a reduction in their diel vertical migration by the mesopelagic fishes, and consequently to the efficiency of the biological carbon pump. In contrast, increased productivity across trophic levels is attested for MIS 19, and subsequent drop in MIS 18, affecting foraminifera, ostracod and sponge biomasses, but not inhibiting fish DVM. As a result, carbon sequestration during MIS 19 was enhanced.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

When recognized by host immune receptors, these proteins become avirulence (AVR) effectors. Several sequence-diverse AVRPM3 effectors and the suppressor of AVRPM3-PM3 recognition (SVRPM3a1/f1) are involved in triggering allele-specific, Pm3-mediated resistance, but the molecular mechanisms controlling their function in the host cell remain unknown. Here, we describe that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other, suggesting they are present as dimers in the host cell. Alphafold2 modelling substantiated previous predictions that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 all adopt a core RNase-like fold. We found that a single amino acid mutation in a predicted surface exposed region of AVRPM3a2/f2 resulted in recognition by the PM3b immune receptor, which does not recognize wildtype AVRPM3a2/f2. This indicates that differential AVRPM3 recognition by variants of the highly related PM3 immune receptors is due to subtle differences in similar protein surfaces of sequence-diverse AVRs. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which homodimers of AVRPM3s are recognized by their corresponding PM3 variants and that heterodimer formation with SVRPM3a1/f1 allows for evasion of recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

In order to explore the landscape and consequences of genetically regulated intron retention, we perform an intron retention quantitative trait loci (irQTL) analysis in 49 human tissues across 838 individuals. We identify 8,624 unique intron retention events associated with genetic polymorphisms. 1,369 irQTLs (16%) are also associated with genome-wide association study (GWAS) traits, suggesting that genetically regulated intron retention may play a causal role in the regulation of these GWAS traits. 1,999 irQTLs (23%) colocalize with eQTLs to their respective gene, suggesting that intron retention and steady-state gene expression levels are regulated by shared sets of genetic variants. Through a colocalization analysis of irQTL:eQTL events, we demonstrate that irQTLs are sufficient to generate eQTLs when one of the alternatively spliced transcripts is preferentially targeted by the nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Surprisingly, for intron retention events whose potential NMD effects can be confidently predicted based on their positions within known gene annotations, we find that 58.8% (923/1570) of the colocalized irQTL and eQTL pairs show effect size directions that are discordant with the NMD model. Moreover, we find that irQTLs are significantly more likely to occur in the same gene with the same effect size direction as compared to exon skipping QTLs. Through mathematical modeling and analysis of experimental perturbation data, we provide evidence that eQTLs are able to generate irQTLs by altering the steady state ratios of spliced and unspliced transcripts, and we postulate that this mechanism may partially underlie the widespread intron retention observed previously in various biological conditions. Taken together, these results show that intron retention and steady state gene expression levels are closely intertwined to regulate phenotypic traits.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

To address this question, we measured the consequences of category learning on the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex, a key waypoint along the ventral visual stream that is known to support object recognition. First, we observed that neural activity across task-trained monkeys IT showed increased object category selectivity, enhanced linear separability (of categories), and overall more categorical representations compared to those from task-naive monkeys. To model how these differences could arise, we next developed a computational hypothesis-generation framework of the monkeys learning process using anatomically-mapped artificial neural network (ANN) models of the primate ventral stream that we combined with various choices of learning algorithms. Our simulations revealed that specific gradient-based, performance-optimizing updates of the ANNs internal representations substantially approximated the observed changes in the IT cortex. Notably, we found that such models predict novel training-induced phenomena in the IT cortex, including changes in category-orthogonal representations and ITs alignment with behavior. This convergence between experimental and modeling results suggests that plasticity in the visual ventral stream follows principles of task optimization that are well approximated by gradient descent. We propose that models like the ones developed here could be used to make accurate predictions about visual plasticity in the ventral stream and its transference - or lack thereof - to any future test image.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

The mtDNA is often not specifically evaluated in patients with suspected Mendelian disease, resulting in overlooked diagnostic variants.

MethodsUsing dedicated pipelines to address the technical challenges posed by the mtDNA - circular genome, variant heteroplasmy, and nuclear misalignment - single nucleotide variants, small indels, and large mtDNA deletions were called from exome and genome sequencing data, in addition to RNA-sequencing when available. A cohort of 6,660 rare disease families were analyzed (5,625 genetically undiagnosed, 84%) from the Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare diseases (GREGoR) Consortium as well as other rare disease cohorts.

ResultsDiagnostic mtDNA variants were identified in 10 previously genetically undiagnosed families (one large deletion, eight reported pathogenic variants, one novel pathogenic variant). In one additional undiagnosed proband, the detection of >900 heteroplasmic variants provided functional evidence of pathogenicity to a novel de novo variant in the nuclear gene POLG (DNA polymerase gamma), responsible for mtDNA replication and repair.

ConclusionmtDNA variant calling from data generated by exome and genome sequencing for nuclear variant analysis resulted in a genetic diagnosis or detection of a candidate variant for 0.4% of undiagnosed families affected by a broad range of rare diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

In this study, we developed two novel red genetically encoded potassium indicators (RGEPOs), RGEPO1 and RGEPO2, through a combination of directed evolution in E. coli and subsequent optimization in mammalian cells. RGEPO1, targeted to the extracellular membrane, and RGEPO2, localized in the cytoplasm, exhibited positive K+-specific fluorescence response with affinities of 3.55 mM and 14.81 mM in HEK293FT cells, respectively. We employed RGEPOs for real-time monitoring of subsecond K+ dynamics in cultured neurons, astrocytes, acute brain slices, and the awake mouse in both intracellular and extracellular environments. Using RGEPOs, we were able, for the first time, to visualize intracellular and extracellular potassium transients during seizures in the brains of awake mice. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations provided new insights into the potassium-binding mechanisms of RGEPO1 and RGEPO2, revealing distinct K+-binding pockets and structural features. Thus, RGEPOs represent a significant advancement in potassium imaging, providing enhanced tools for real-time visualization of K+ dynamics in various cell types and cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Motor units, each of which consists of a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates, contribute to the total activation of each muscle through their recruitment and firing rate when active. However, it remains unknown how the nervous system controls locomotor speed by changing the firing of individual motor units. To address this, we combined quantitative behavioral analysis of mouse locomotion with single motor unit recordings from the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii, which drive monoarticular extension of the elbow and biarticular movements of the elbow and shoulder, respectively. In contrast to prior studies employing bulk EMG to examine muscle activity, our recordings revealed the diversity of spike patterning across motor units as well as systematic differences in motor unit activity across muscles and locomotor speeds. First, motor unit activity differed significantly across the lateral and long heads, suggesting differential control of these two closely apposed elbow extensor muscles. Second, we found that individual units were recruited probabilistically during only a subset of strides, showing that bulk EMG signals consistently present in every stride in fact reflect stochastically varying subsets of individual motor units. Finally, although recruitment probability and firing rate both increased at faster walking speeds, increases in recruitment were proportionally larger than rate changes, and recruitment of individual units accompanied changes in limb kinematics. Together, these results reveal how the firing of individual motor units varies systematically across muscles and walking speeds to produce flexible locomotor behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Identifying molecular pathways and compounds that target these pathways is critical for improving patient outcomes. RNF4, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, is pivotal in oncoprotein stabilization and DNA repair, enhancing cancer cell survival driving tumorigenesis. Elevated RNF4 levels are associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Here, we describe the development of R4VPs, proteolysis-targeted chimeras-like (PROTACs-like). R4VPs promote RNF4 degradation and reduce the levels of its stabilized oncoproteins. Notably, R4VPs induce ferroptotic cell death selectively in cancer cells, sparing non-tumorigenic and primary cells. Surprisingly, R4VPs-induced ferroptosis is independent of RNF4 but preferentially targets tumor-driving mutations, particularly those in the EGFR pathway, while not affecting PI3K-transformed cells. R4VPs effectively induce cell death in therapy-resistant melanoma and sarcomas including patient-derived sarcoma tumor cells. Our findings highlight the potential of ferroptosis inducers such as R4VPs as a therapeutic strategy for therapy resistance, aggressive, and hard-to-treat cancers.

Co-administration of a leader-protein-encoding mRNA (which we have named ""RNAx"") delivered alongside vaccine cargo saRNA reduced interferon production while enhancing Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) expression in human primary cells and murine models.

Simulations demonstrate ResidPCA's efficacy, particularly in complex scenarios, with its accuracy more than four times higher than conventional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and over three times higher than Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)-based methods in identifying states expressed across multiple cell types. In scRNA-seq data from light-stimulated mouse visual cortex cells, ResidPCA captures stimulus-driven variability with an accuracy more than five times higher than NMF methods. In single nucleus data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort, ResidPCA identified 44 snATAC-based and 42 snRNA-based states. 30 snATAC states were significantly enriched for Alzheimer's disease heritability and were often more significantly enriched than established cell types such as microglia. The ResidPCA-based snATAC state most significantly enriched for Alzheimer's disease heritability further elucidates a recently identified mechanism involving the neuron-ODC-microglial axis. This state links early amyloid production in neurons and oligodendrocytes with later-stage microglial activation and immune response, driving Alzheimer's disease progression. These results demonstrate ResidPCA's ability to reveal additional biological variation in single-cell data and uncover disease-relevant cell states.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Such cueing guides attention by providing prior knowledge about the likely spatial location of task-relevant events. Yet, it has been compellingly argued that such spatial priors also elicit expectation effects, rendering Posner cueing unsuitable for measuring attentional effects in isolation. We address this debate by combining signal detection theory models of behavior with concurrent electrophysiological recordings, and directly compare Posner cueing effects with those of attention and expectation cueing. Participants performed two tasks: a dual cueing task, with orthogonal relevance (attention) and probability (expectation) cues, as well as a Posner cueing task. Relevance and probability cueing independently modulated distinct behavioral parameters - perceptual sensitivity and decisional criterion, respectively - whereas Posner cueing modulated both sensitivity and criterion. However, only sensitivity modulations by Posner cueing were correlated with those of relevance cueing. Criterion modulations by Posner cueing were uncorrelated with those of probability cueing. Both Posner and relevance cueing, but not probability cueing, modulated various neural markers of spatial attention, including steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitude and alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillation power. Representational similarity analysis and cue-label prediction with deep convolutional neural networks revealed dissociable underpinnings of relevance and probability cueing, and identified Posner cueings neural representations with those of relevance cueing. Our results address a long-standing debate in the attention literature and clearly demonstrate that spatial selection by probabilistic cueing is governed by neural mechanisms of attention, not expectation.

Significance StatementHow does our brain select relevant information for accomplishing task goals? ""Posner cueing"" is a popular choice for studying brain mechanisms of goal-driven attention in the lab. Posner cues guide attention by providing advance information about the likely location of task-relevant events. Yet, Posner cueing has been criticized because it engages brain mechanisms not only of attention but of event expectation, as well. We address this critique by employing state-of-the-art neural decoding approaches, including deep convolutional neural networks, and show that behavioral and neural underpinnings of Posner cueing closely match those of attention, not expectation. The results address a long-standing debate in the attention literature and validate Posner cueing as a reliable method for measuring attentions effects in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Notably, we discovered ""mirror"" neurons that activated transiently after hearing and before producing specific speech sounds, and ""bridge"" neurons that maintained activity between the same speech elements during listening and speaking.

A more powerful approach is to detect protein structural similarity between query proteins and known CAZymes indicative of distant homology. Here, we developed CAZyme3D (https://pro.unl.edu/CAZyme3D/) to fill the research gap that no dedicated 3D structure databases are currently available for CAZymes. CAZyme3D contains a total of 870,740 AlphaFold predicted 3D structures (named Whole dataset). A subset of CAZymes 3D structures from 188,574 nonredundant sequences (named ID50 dataset) were subject to structural similarity-based clustering analyses. Such clustering allowed us to organize all CAZyme structures using a hierarchical classification, which includes existing levels defined by the CAZy database (class, clan, family, subfamily) and newly defined levels (subclasses, structural cluster [SC] groups, and SCs). The inter-family structural clustering successfully grouped CAZy families and clans with the same structural folds in the same subclasses. The intra-family structural clustering classified structurally similar CAZymes into SCs, which were further classified into SC groups. SCs and SC groups differed from sequence similarity-based CAZy subfamilies. With CAZyme structures as the search database, we created job submission pages, where users can submit query protein sequences or PDB structures for a structural similarity search.

Models invoke phase separation of conformational ensembles of chromatin fibers as a mechanism regulating chromatin organization in vivo. Here we combine biochemistry and molecular dynamics simulations to examine, at single base-pair resolution, how nucleosome spacing controls chromatin phase separation. We show that as DNA linkers extend from 25 bp to 30 bp, as examplars of 10N+5 and 10N (integer N) bp lengths, chromatin condensates become less thermodynamically stable and nucleosome mobility increases. Simulations reveal that this is due to trade-offs between inter- and intramolecular nucleosome stacking, favored by rigid 10N+5 and 10N bp linkers, respectively. A remodeler can induce or inhibit phase separation by moving nucleosomes, changing the balance between intra- and intermolecular stacking. The intrinsic phase separation capacity of chromatin enables fine tuning of compaction and dynamics, likely contributing to heterogeneous chromatin organization in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, the presence of Cav3.2, encoded by the CACNA1H gene, in human DRG neurons remains unresolved.

However, it was recently suggested that DBS may accelerate cognitive decline in this frequent genetic subgroup, raising major concerns on its indication. Primary aim of this study was to investigate the possible additive effects of GBA1 genotype and DBS implant on cognitive deterioration and other non-motor features in the long term. As secondary aims, we assessed the clinical outcomes of DBS-GBA-PD stratified by GBA1 variant classes (severe/complex, mild, risk, unknown), and by different DBS targets (subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus).

This is a multicenter retrospective, controlled, Italian cohort study involving 15 tertiary level Movement Disorder Centers contributing to the PARKNET cohort.

Demographic, motor, cognitive and other non-motor features were collected at baseline after 1, 3 and 5 years, between years 2005 and 2021. We selected 615 PD participants who either underwent DBS surgery (430 DBS-nonGBA-PD and 109 DBS-GBA-PD) or fulfilled the same criteria for DBS eligibility but eventually were not operated (76 nonDBS-GBA-PD).

Assessments included motor, cognitive and other non-motor features, as well as long-term complications, across all groups and time points. Within-group longitudinal outcome changes, between-group differences, and subgroups analyses stratified by GBA1 variant classes and DBS targets were performed.

At baseline, the three cohorts were largely matched for demographic, motor, cognitive and other non-motor features. Longitudinally, both DBS groups showed marked improvements of motor symptoms and quality of life, a benefit which was absent in nonDBS-GBA-PD. Cognitive deterioration, as well as hallucinations and urinary problems, significantly increased in both GBA-PD groups compared to nonGBA-PD, regardless of DBS. No relevant differences in the clinical outcomes emerged upon stratification of GBA-PD for variant classes or for DBS targets, up to 3 years after surgery.

DBS represents a valid therapeutic option for GBA-PD, as it generates prolonged benefits on motor symptoms and quality of life while not modifying the occurrence of cognitive deterioration and other non-motor features.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

To date, no reliable resistance gene sources have been identified in soybean or other legumes to combat M. phaseolina. Therefore, the identification of mechanistic targets is crucial for improving resistance against the pathogen. The apoplast is a critical region where intense molecular cross-talks occur between plants and pathogens, and the outcome of their interactions is determined in this compartment. Here, we employed label-free quantitative (LFQ) proteomics to investigate the dynamics of soybean root apoplast during M. phaseolina infection. We have detected several secreted proteins of M. phaseolina and differential regulation of soybean-secreted proteins in root apoplast during infections. Glycome analysis and callose deposition assays have revealed significant changes in soybean root cell wall compositions and potential polysaccharide targets of M. phaseolina. AlphaFold 2 (AF2) analysis has revealed several interesting sequence-unrelated structurally similar (SUSS) effectors and effectors with novel structural folds secreted by M. phaseolina. Furthermore, AlphaFold Multimer (AFM) analysis has revealed protease-inhibitor interactions displayed by candidate-secreted proteins from soybean and M. phaseolina. We have validated these interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) and competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) approaches. Therefore, our work provides insights into Soybean-M. phaseolina interactions in the root apoplast and unveil potential candidates for engineering resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

While DPP4 physically associates with the Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and its inhibitors exert natriuretic effects, the DPP4 role in blood pressure (BP) regulation remains controversial. This study investigated the effects of PT-specific Dpp4 deletion (Dpp4{Delta}PT) and global Dpp4 deletion (Dpp4-/-) on systolic blood pressure (SBP), natriuresis, and NHE3 regulation under baseline and angiotensin II (Ang II)-stimulated conditions in both male and female mice. Global and PT-specific Dpp4 deletion increased diuretic and natriuretic responses to acute saline loading, correlating with enhanced phosphorylation of NHE3 at serine 552 (pS552-NHE3). However, baseline SBP remained unchanged. Ang II stimulation increased DPP4 activity in control mice, with a greater effect in males than in females, reflecting sex-dependent regulation of renal DPP4. In Dpp4{Delta}PT mice, residual kidney DPP4 was unresponsive to Ang II, indicating that PT DPP4, rather than DPP4 in other nephron segments, is regulated by Ang II. Ang II administration increased SBP in all groups; however, the pressor response was significantly attenuated in both Dpp4{Delta}PT and Dpp4-/- mice, coinciding with sustained elevated levels of pS552-NHE3. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that PT DPP4 modulates NHE3 activity through mechanisms that prevent the accumulation of pS552-NHE3, exerting an anti-natriuretic effect. In the absence of DPP4, these mechanisms are disrupted, reducing Ang II sensitivity and maintaining high pS552-NHE3 levels, underscoring the role of DPP4 in PT signaling and function.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

We previously identified the mitochondrial protein 4-Nitrophenylphosphatase Domain and Non-Neuronal SNAP25-Like 1 (Nipsnap1) as a novel regulatory factor that integrates with lipid metabolism and is critical to sustain the long-term activation of BAT, but the precise mechanism and function of Nipsnap1 is unknown. Objectives: Define how the regulatory factor Nipsnap1 integrates with lipid metabolism. Methods: We generated adeno-associated viral (AAV) constructs that overexpress Nipsnap1 in the thermogenic fat of mice. We then measured both whole-body and cellular mitochondrial metabolism and mapped the first Nipsnap1 interacting protein-protein network. Results: Herein, we show that adipose-specific overexpression of Nipsnap1 in mice increases energy expenditure through the utilization of lipids as an energy substrate. The increase in energy expenditure results in reduced weight gain. Additionally, we show that Nipsnap1 overexpression in primary adipocytes increases lipid beta-oxidation. Moreover, we mapped the first protein-protein network of Nipsnap1 in brown adipocytes and show that Nipsnap1 interacts with proteins that regulate both peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. Conclusion: This study elucidates a mechanistic function of Nipsnap1 in thermogenic fat where Nipsnap1 facilitates a functional connection between peroxisomal and mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathways. By enhancing lipid utilization as energy substrates, Nipsnap1 plays a pivotal role in sustaining thermogenic fat activation to increase energy expenditure. These findings underscore the potential of Nipsnap1 as a therapeutic target for metabolic health.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, the widespread epigenome repatterning that characterizes most cancers is also highly heterogenous within tumors and could generate cells with diverse identities and malignant features. We show that high levels of the epigenetic regulator and oncogene, UHRF1, in zebrafish hepatocytes rapidly induced methylome disordering, loss of heterochromatin, and DNA damage, resulting in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and acquisition of stemness. Reducing UHRF1 expression transitions these cells from senescent to proliferation-competent. The expansion of these damaged cells results in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) that have immature cancer cells intermingled with fibroblasts, immune and senescent cells expressing high UHRF1 levels, which serve as reservoirs for new cancer cells. This defines a distinct and heterogenous HCC subtype resulting from epigenetic changes, stemness and senescence escape.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Mice harboring a genetic deletion of the Arpc4 subunit of the complex form LC networks at birth, but these cells decline in numbers following a process reminiscent of premature cellular aging. By combining in vivo analyses of LCs with in vitro experiments on bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells, we found that Arpc4-deficient cells manage to progress through the cell cycle but accumulate DNA damage associated with aberrant nuclear shapes and events of nuclear envelope rupture.

This study introduces ContextMirror2.0 (CM2.0), a coevolution-based method designed to address these limitations.

However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Although the behavioral manifestations of sequence learning are clear, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Motor sequence learning may arise from three distinct processes: (1) improved execution of individual movements independent of their sequential context; (2) enhanced anticipation of ""what"" movement should be executed next, enabling faster initiation; and (3) the development of motoric sequence-specific representations that encode ""how"" movements should be optimally performed within a sequence. However, many existing paradigms conflate the ""what"" and ""how"" components of learning, as participants often acquire both the sequence content (what to do) and its execution (how to do it). This overlap obscures the distinct contributions of each mechanism to motor sequence learning. In this study, we disentangled these mechanisms using a continuous reaching task. Performance in trained sequences was compared to random sequences to rule out improvements attributable solely to isolated movement execution. By also varying how many upcoming targets were visible we assessed the role of anticipation in learning. When participants could only see one future target, improvements were mostly due to them learning which target would come next. When they could see four future targets, participants immediately demonstrated fast movement times and increased movement smoothness, surpassing late-stage performance in the one target condition. Crucially, even with full visibility of future targets, participants showed further sequence-specific learning caused by a continuous optimization of movement trajectories. Follow-up experiments revealed that the learned sequence representations were effector-specific and encoded contextual information of four movements or longer. Our paradigm enables a clear dissociation between the ""what"" and ""how"" components of motor sequence learning and provides compelling evidence for the development of effector-specific sequence representations that guide optimal movement execution.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Our results indicated high prediction accuracy of both types of SSL models relative to neural activity before and after word onsets. It was the shared components between Wav2Vec2.0 and GPT-2 that explained the majority portion of the SSL-brain similarity. Furthermore, we observed distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: both models showed high encoding accuracy 40 milliseconds before word onset, especially in the mid-superior temporal gyrus (mid-STG), which can be explained by the shared contextual components in the SSL models; the Wav2Vec2.0 also peaked at 200 milliseconds after word onset around the posterior STG, which was mainly attributed to the acoustic-phonetic and static semantic information encoded in the SSL models. These results highlight how contextual and acoustic-phonetic cues encoded in DNNs align with spatiotemporal neural activity patterns, suggesting a significant overlap in how artificial and biological systems process linguistic information.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Lewy pathology, containing -synuclein, is often associated with regional tau pathology burden in LBD. Similarly, granulovacuolar degeneration bodies (GVBs) have been associated with tau pathology in Alzheimers disease. Interestingly, GVBs have been detected in a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions including both -synucleinopathies and tauopathies. Despite the frequent co-occurrence, little is known about the relationship between -synuclein, tau, and granulovacuolar degeneration.

MethodsWe developed a mouse model of limbic-predominant -synucleinopathy by stereotactic injection of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the basal forebrain. This model was used to investigate the relationship of -synuclein pathology with tau and GVB formation.

ResultsOur model displayed widespread -synuclein pathology with a limbic predominant distribution. Aberrantly phosphorylated tau accumulated in a subset of -synuclein inclusion-bearing neurons, often colocalized with lysosomes. Many of these same neurons also contained CHMP2b- and CK1{delta}-positive granules, established markers of GVBs, which suggests a link between tau accumulation and GVB formation. Despite this observation, GVBs were also detected in tau-deficient mice following PFF-injection, suggesting that pathological -synuclein alone is sufficient to elicit GVB formation.

ConclusionsOur findings support that -synuclein pathology can independently elicit granulovacuolar degeneration. The frequent co-accumulation of tau and GVBs suggests a parallel mechanism of cellular dysfunction. The ability of -synuclein pathology to drive GVB formation in the absence of tau highlights the broader relevance of this process to neurodegeneration with relevance to the pathobiology of LBD.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

There are a range of methods for HGT inference, but they are seldom systematically compared with each other. This is due to the validation problem associated with HGT inference. It is impossible to go back in time and know the true HGT events that we infer today, that too after the effect of other evolutionary processes. In the absence of such a benchmark, inference methods are often validated using simulated data. Simulations may not accurately reflect reality. They can be biased by our current understanding of evolution and by simplifying assumptions. The assumptions made in the inference model may also get incorporated into the simulation. Here, we perform a large-scale comparison of HGT inference methods using a common dataset of bacterial genomic data. We focus on how they infer clusters of neighboring co-acquisitions and co-transferred genes, as well as the inference of HGT experienced by genes associated with environmental response. Our analysis reveals that implicit phylogenetic methods, which depend on gene presence-absence profiles rather than gene trees, demonstrate superior performance in inferring meaningful HGT events. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate inference method to accurately infer HGT. We offer practical recommendations to guide the choice of such methods and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which can inform future development of HGT inference approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

BANKSY-based spatially-informed clustering identified nine FB subpopulations, with SFRP2+ RetD FB and CCL19+ nonPV FB as novel subpopulations that reside in specific cellular niches and display unique gene expression profiles. SFRP2+ RetD FB and CCL19+ nonPV FB as well as COL8A1+ FB, display altered frequencies in SSc skin and play specific, disease-promoting roles for extracellular matrix release and leukocyte recruitment as revealed by their transcriptional profile, their cellular interactions and ligand-receptor analyses. The frequencies of COL8A1+ FB and their interactions with monocytic cells and B cells are associated with progression of skin fibrosis in SSc. In summary, our spatially-resolved transcriptomic approach identified novel fibroblast subpopulations deregulated in SSc skin with specific pathogenic roles, some of which may potentially serve as biomarkers for progression of skin fibrosis.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Here, we report that the adaptive immune system CRISPR-Cas supervises the expression of diverse immune systems by exploiting the regulatory CRISPR RNA-like RNAs (crlRNAs). The crlRNAs target and inhibit the promoters of various immune systems, including the newly characterized Nezha and Gabija, as well as eight previously unrecognized systems that feature distinct defensive domains. Notably, CRISPR regulation balances the expression level of these systems to ensure effective anti-phage activity while avoiding their autoimmunity risks. In return, the supervised immune systems trigger abortive infections when CRISPR-Cas is inhibited by viral anti-CRISPR proteins, thereby offering an anti-anti-CRISPR protection at the population level. Moreover, these systems complement CRISPR immunity with a differing anti-phage profile. These findings highlight the pivotal role of CRISPR-Cas in orchestrating a diverse range of immune systems and showcase the delicate synergy among the multilayered defense strategies in prokaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

The link between ASD and skin abnormalities, inducing itchiness, has never been investigated in depth. This study explores mechanical itch sensitivity in the Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mouse model. Key observations include heightened scratching in response to skin deformation and hypersensitivity to mechanical itch (i.e. alloknesis) in Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice. In Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice, ex vivo electrophysiological experiments revealed that C-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs) were hyporesponsive, and transcriptomic analysis showed a downregulation of TAFA4, a protein secreted by C-LMTRs. Interestingly, pharmacologically inhibiting A{beta}-LTMR, important in mechanical itch initiation, abolished the itch hypersensitivity. Also, TAFA4 injections reduced the spontaneous scratching response to skin deformation but failed to restore itch sensitivity. Our data suggest that somatosensory deficits in Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice lead to hypersensitivity to itchiness and indicate that two pathways might regulate mechanical itchiness, dependent on TAFA4.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

The defining feature of NF2-SWN is the presence of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VSs), which grow over time and can result in irreversible sensorineural hearing loss, significantly affecting the quality of life for those affected. At present, there are no FDA-approved medications specifically for treating VS or related hearing loss. VS management involves radiotherapy or surgical resection, while bevacizumab, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody (VEGF) may be used off-label in NF2-SWN to shrink the tumor. However, not all patients respond, and the effect is not always durable. There is a critical need for effective medications that can stop the growth of VS and prevent hearing loss associated with these tumors. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed cancer therapy, their potential has not been thoroughly explored in non-malignant tumors such as VS.

MethodsWe characterize the effects of anti-PD1 (PD1) treatment on tumor growth and hearing function in two syngeneic, immune-competent VS models.

ResultsWe demonstrated that combining VEGF treatment with PD1 significantly enhances the efficacy of each monotherapy. Specifically, i) VEGF enhances PD1 efficacy by normalizing the tumor vasculature to improve drug delivery and immune cell infiltration, and by activating T cell and NK cell anti-tumor cytotoxicity via NKG2D upregulation; and ii) combining PD1 with VEGF treatment effectively controls tumors that progressed despite VEGF treatment.

ConclusionThese findings provide a strong foundation for the development of PD1 with VEGF combination therapies for patients with NF2-SWN.

Key pointsWe filled a critical gap in NF2 research:

1) we characterized the effects of immunotherapy on tumor growth and hearing function in non-malignant vestibular schwannomas

2) We showed combined anti-VEGF and anti-PD1 enhances the efficacy of each monotherapy

Importance of the studyTreatment options for patients with NF2-SWN are limited or are associated with significant co-morbidities. There are no approved medical treatments for NF2-related tumors. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed cancer therapy, their potential has not been thoroughly explored in non-malignant tumors such as VS. Our work filled this critical gap in NF2-SWN research. For the first time, we systemically evaluated ICI efficacy on tumor growth and hearing function in non-malignant schwannomas.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that combining VEGF treatment with PD1 significantly enhances the efficacy of each monotherapy. Specifically: i) VEGF enhances PD1 efficacy by normalizing the tumor vasculature to improve drug delivery and immune cell infiltration, and by activating T cell and NK cell anti-tumor cytotoxicity via NKG2D upregulation; and ii) combining PD1 with VEGF treatment effectively controls tumors that progress despite VEGF treatment.

As PRS can be derived from a single biological sample and remain stable throughout life, we explore the potential of PRS to optimize existing screening programs. Methods: Using UK Biobank (n = 444,949), we quantified the potential clinical benefits arising from a knowledge of PRS across seven diseases with existing screening programs globally (breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, abdominal aortic aneurysm, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease). We identified individuals at high genetic risk (PRS OR>2) and very high genetic risk (PRS OR>3) and estimated the optimal screening ages for these genetically high risk individuals, based on the equivalent risk to population-level risk at recommended screening ages. We then leveraged published mortality estimates, with and without screening-based interventions, to assess the potential benefits of tailoring screening age based on genetic risk. We also estimated the case enrichment ratio, which is a ratio of the percentage of cases in the high PRS risk group and in the total population. Findings: Very high risk individuals reach the risk level associated with usual starting screening age on average 10.8 years earlier, high risk individuals 8.9 years earlier and reduced risk individuals (OR<0.5) 16.8 years later. During this time, case enrichment in the high risk group is between 1.7 and 3.0 depending on disease. Across all seven diseases, appropriate interventions following PRS-guided screening would reduce premature deaths in high risk individuals by 19.0%. Conclusion: Knowledge of genetic risk, measured using PRS, has the potential to deliver substantial public health benefits when aggregated across conditions, and could reduce premature mortality by tailoring existing screening programs.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

However, the mechanisms that separate TADs remain incompletely understood. Most boundaries between TADs contain CTCF binding sites (CBSs), which individually contribute to the blocking of Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. Using genome-wide classification, we show here that TAD boundary width forms a continuum from narrow to highly extended and correlates with CBS distribution, chromatin features, and gene regulatory elements. To investigate how these boundary widths emerge, we modified the Random Cross-Linker (RCL) polymer model to incorporate specific boundary configurations, enabling us to evaluate the differential impact of boundary composition on TAD insulation. Our analysis identifies three generic boundary categories, each influencing TAD insulation differently, with varying local and distal effects on neighboring domains. Notably, we find that increasing boundary width reduces long-range inter-TAD contacts, as confirmed by Hi-C data. While blocking loop extrusion at boundaries indirectly promotes spurious intermingling of neighboring TADs, extended boundaries counteract this effect, emphasizing their role in maintaining genome structure. In conclusion, TAD boundary width not only enhances the efficiency of loop extrusion blocking but may also modulate enhancer-promoter contacts over long distances across TADs boundaries, providing a mechanism for transcriptional regulation.

Significance statementTopologically Associating Domains (TADs) compartmentalize vertebrate genomes to limit cross-domain enhancer-promoter loops. Our study reveals that boundaries between TADs are diverse genomic entities that range from narrow to highly extended. Using an interdisciplinary approach that combines genome-wide data analysis with biophysical polymer modeling, we find that wider TAD boundaries reduce spurious long-range interactions between neighboring domains. Moreover, we reveal how different boundary components can create this difference in insulating capacity. Our identification and characterization of TAD boundary width and composition suggests they have the potential to regulate the formation of enhancer-promoter loops across TAD boundaries at close and long distance.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Prior studies of earlier generations of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) demonstrated narrowband spectral increases in the electroencephalographic (EEG) spindle frequency range (11-16 Hz) in non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. However, the impact of 5G RF-EMF on sleep remains unexplored. Additionally, RF-EMF can activate L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCC), which have been linked to sleep quality and EEG oscillatory activity.

ObjectiveThis study investigates whether the allelic variant rs7304986 in the CACNA1C gene, encoding the 1C subunit of LTCC, modulates 5G RF-EMF effects on EEG spindle activity during NREM sleep.

MethodsThirty-four healthy, matched participants, genotyped for rs7304986 (15 T/C and 19 T/T carriers), underwent a double-blind, sham-controlled study with standardized left-hemisphere exposure to two 5G RF-EMF signals (3.6 GHz and 700 MHz) for 30 min before sleep. Sleep spindle activity was analyzed using high-density EEG and the Fitting Oscillations & One Over f (FOOOF) algorithm.

ResultsT/C carriers reported longer sleep latency compared to T/T carriers. A significant interaction between RF-EMF exposure and rs7304986 genotype was observed, with 3.6 GHz exposure in T/C carriers inducing a faster spindle center frequency in the central, parietal, and occipital cortex compared to sham.

ConclusionThese findings suggest 3.6 GHz 5G RF-EMF modulates spindle center frequency during NREM sleep in a CACNA1C genotype-dependent manner, implicating LTCC in the physiological response to RF-EMF and underscoring the need for further research into 5G effects on brain health.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576977

To demonstrate the platforms capabilities, we created and implemented pipelines to reanalyze two distinct biological datasets. First, we recreated a population genomics analysis of the socially flexible halictid bee, Lasioglossum albipes, using pipemake-generated workflows for de novo genome annotation, processing of variant data, dimensionality reduction, and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We then used pipemake to analyze behavioral tracking data from the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. In both cases, pipemake workflows produced results consistent with published findings while substantially reducing hands-on analysis time. Overall, pipemakes modular design allows researchers to easily modify existing pipelines or develop new ones without software development expertise. Beyond streamlining workflow creation, pipemake leverages the full Snakemake ecosystem to enable parallel processing, automated error recovery, and comprehensive analysis documentation.

Here we show that LAMA5, a central BM component, is critical for luminal mammary tumour initiation, and controls tumor progression and phenotype development. LAMA5 is overexpressed in both human and mouse luminal mammary tumours and LAMA5 downregulation attenuates growth of human breast cancer cells. Prepubertal luminal deletion of Lama5 in MMTV-PyMT mice results in marked reduction in emergence of early hyperplasias, along with a shift from mature hormone receptor (HR+) positive luminal epithelial phenotype towards a HR+ progenitor phenotype, and widespread alterations in extracellular matrix and Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signalling genes, including overexpression of Fgf receptor 2 (Fgfr2) in the HR+ progenitor cells. Single allele deletion, but not biallelic deletion of Lama5 additionally inhibits growth and progression towards advanced mammary carcinomas. However, inhibition of Fgf receptors restores growth decrease and induces apoptosis in biallelic-Lama5-deleted organoids without affecting wildtype organoids.

The hypothesis that high-altitude mosquitoes spread pathogens over large distances has not been directly tested. Here, we report for the first time that high-altitude windborne mosquitoes are commonly infected with arboviruses, protozoans, and helminths affecting vertebrates and humans, and provide the first description of this pathogen-vector aerial network. A total of 1,017 female mosquitoes (81.4%, N=1,249) intercepted on nets suspended from helium balloons at altitudes of 120-290 m above ground over Mali and Ghana were screened for infection with arboviruses, plasmodia, and filariae, using pan-genus qPCR analyses followed by sequencing of positive samples. The mosquito fauna collected at altitude comprised 61 species, across 9 genera, dominated by Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles. Infection and infectiousness rates of high-altitude migrant mosquitoes were 7.2% and 4.4% with plasmodia, 1.6% and 0.6% with filariae, 3.5% and 1.1% with flaviviruses, respectively. Nineteen mosquito-borne pathogens were identified, including three arboviruses: dengue, West Nile and MPoko viruses, 13 putative plasmodia species including Plasmodium matutinum and P. relictum, three filariids, including Pelecitus spp., 27 insect-specific viruses and 5 non-mosquito-borne pathogens (e.g., Trypanosoma theileri). Confirmed head-thorax (disseminated) infections of multiple pathogens in multiple mosquito species, eg., Culex perexiguus, Coquilletidia metallica, Mansonia uniformis, and Anopheles squamosus provides evidence that pathogens carried by high-altitude windborne mosquitoes are infectious and likely capable of infecting naive hosts far from their starting location. This traffic of sylvatic pathogens may be key to their maintenance among foci as well as initiating outbreaks away from them.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Nevertheless, condensates have been shown to interact with lipid membranes in diverse biological processes, such as autophagy and T-cell activation. Since many condensates are known to have a net surface charge density and associated electric potential(s), we hypothesized that they can induce a local membrane potential. Using an electrochromic dye, we demonstrate that poly-lysine/ATP condensates induce a localized membrane potential in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles. This effect diminishes with increasing salt concentration and higher ATP-to-poly-lysine ratios, underscoring the key role of condensate charge. Numerical modeling of the condensate-membrane interface using an electro-thermodynamic framework supports our experimental findings and highlights parameters expected to play a key role in the effect. These results have broad implications for biological processes regulated by membrane potential, particularly in contexts such as neuronal signaling, where condensate interactions with membranes may play a previously unrecognized regulatory role.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Furthermore, sensory neuronal TrkB expression and function has been traditionally associated with non-nociceptive neurons, particularly A{delta} low-threshold mechanoreceptors. This study challenges prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that TrkBT1 is the predominant TrkB isoform expressed in sensory neurons and plays a functional role in modulating neuronal activity. We demonstrate that TrkBT1 is the predominant isoform expressed in nociceptors, identified by markers such as TRPV1, TRPA1, TRPM8 and 5HT3A, as well as non-nociceptors, while the full-length isoform (TrkBTK+) is restricted to non-nociceptive subpopulation. Functionally, we show that acute application of BDNF induces modest calcium influx in nociceptors and prolonged BDNF exposure significantly potentiates capsaicin-induced calcium influx, an effect blocked by the TrkB-specific antagonist ANA12. Additionally, BDNF also promotes the survival of both nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons in culture, an effect dependent on TrkBT1 activity. Our data also reveal that ANA12 inhibits BDNF-mediated neuronal sensitization and survival in a concentration-dependent manner, implicating distinct TrkBT1 signaling pathways in these processes. Collectively, our findings redefine TrkBT1 as a functional modulator of nociceptor activity rather than a passive regulator of full-length TrkB. By uncovering its dual roles in nociceptor sensitization and survival, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of BDNF/TrkB signaling in pain. Future work evaluating the role of TrkBT1 in sensory biology could offer new perspectives on how this receptor contributes to neuronal function and plasticity during chronic pain conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Previously, we showed that transplantation of cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) opens a robust period of ocular dominance plasticity 33-35 days after transplantation into neonatal host visual cortex. The plasticity can be induced by transplanting either PV or SST MGE-derived cortical interneurons; it requires transplanted interneurons to express the vesicular GABAergic transporter; and it is manifested by changes to the host visual circuit. Here, we show that transplantation of MGE-derived cortical interneurons into the adult host visual cortex also opens a period of ocular dominance plasticity. The transplanted interneurons must be active to induce plasticity, and the neuronal activity and tuning of visually evoked responses in transplanted and host PV and SST interneurons are modulated by the locomotor state of the host. We also show that changes in activity over the period of plasticity induction are different between PV and SST interneurons but similar between host and transplanted interneurons of each type. The present findings demonstrate that the transplant-induced plasticity generated in adult visual cortex has many features in common with the role of these interneurons during the normal, juvenile critical period.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

The recognition between NLRs and pathogen secreted effectors often triggers a localized programmed cell death termed hypersensitive response (HR). Despite significant progresses have been achieved in understanding canonical NLRs with the N-terminal Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains, the molecular mechanisms underlying TIR-only proteins in plant immune responses remain unclear. In this study, we identified six TIR-containing proteins in maize, including three TIR-only proteins. Functional analysis showed that ZmTIR1 and ZmTIR2, but not ZmTIR3, confer autoactive HR when transiently expressed in N. benthamiana. The autoactivity conferred by ZmTIR1 and ZmTIR2 depends on EDS1-PAD4-RNL module and their putative NADase activities. Interestingly, ZmTIR1 and ZmTIR2 predominantly localize in the punctate dots and likely form condensation, while ZmTIR3 mainly localizes in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Two specific amino acids in the BB-loop region were identified to be required for ZmTIR1- and ZmTIR2-mediated condensation formation and auto-HR. Furthermore, ZmTIR and ZmTIR2 are induced by Cochliobolus heterostrophus, the causal agent of southern leaf blight (SLB) in maize, and knock-down the expression of ZmTIR1 or ZmTIR2 decreased the resistance to SLB in maize.

Recently, a proxy for DNA mechanics, cyclizability, was measured by loop-seq and enabled genome-scale investigation of DNA mechanics. Here, we use this dataset to build a computational model predicting bias-corrected intrinsic cyclizability, with near-perfect accuracy, solely based on DNA sequence. Further, the model predicts intrinsic bending direction in 3D space. Using this tool, we aimed to probe mechanical selection - that is, the evolutionary selection of DNA sequence based on its mechanical properties - in diverse circumstances. First, we found that the intrinsic bend direction of DNA sequences correlated with the observed bending in known protein-DNA complex structures, suggesting that many proteins co-evolved with their DNA partners to capture DNA in its intrinsically preferred bent conformation. We then applied our model to large-scale yeast population genetics data and showed that centromere DNA element II, whose consensus sequence is unknown, leaving its sequence-specific role unclear, is under mechanical selection to increase the stability of inner-kinetochore structure and to facilitate centromeric histone recruitment. Finally, in silico evolution under strong mechanical selection discovered hallucinated sequences with cyclizability values so extreme that they required experimental validation, yet, found in nature in the densely packed mitochondrial(mt) DNA of Namystynia karyoxenos, an ocean-dwelling protist with extreme mitochondrial gene fragmentation. The need to transmit an extraordinarily large amount of mtDNA, estimated to be > 600 Mb, in combination with the absence of mtDNA compaction proteins may have pushed mechanical selection to the extreme. Similarly extreme DNA mechanics are observed in bird microchromosomes, although the functional consequence is not yet clear. The discovery of eccentric DNA mechanics in unrelated unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes suggests that we can predict extreme natural biology which can arise through strong selection. Our methods offer a way to study the biological functions of DNA mechanics in any genome and to engineer DNA sequences with desired mechanical properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576977

Combining cell culture with three-dimensional vertex modeling, we demonstrate that epithelium stratifies via nucleation-growth process, i.e., multilayer origins dispersedly appear and expand across the epithelium via unordered intermediate states. This process is akin to a phase transition induced by a mechanical instability inherent in the foam-like geometry of the epithelium.

However, while hippocampal allocentric position coding in reference to external landmarks is well characterized, the determinants of idiothetic hippocampal distance coding remain poorly understood. Using virtual reality, electrophysiological recordings in mice, and local cue manipulations we could dissociate distance from position coding. In the cue-poor condition, we found pervasive distance coding with high distance indices in all bidirectional place cells including both superficial and deep CA1 pyramidal cells. In this condition, the mapping of distance onto a low-dimensional manifold and rigid distance relationships between place fields suggested strong attractor dynamics similar to those observed for grid cells. Inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which disrupts grid cells, significantly reduced both distance coding and rigid distance dynamics, suggesting an alteration (but not complete abolition) of the underlying attractor. In contrast, allocentric position coding could be observed in cue-rich environments, predominantly engaged deep CA1 pyramidal cells, and persisted during MS inactivation. These results are consistent with a selective contribution of grid cells and associated rigid attractor dynamics to hippocampal idiothetic distance coding but not allocentric position coding.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

However, an increased incidence of severe dengue and fatalities are seen in females of the reproductive age. As per vaginal (PV) bleeding is an important complication that has not been well characterized, we sought to determine the frequency, complications and disease outcomes in women who develop PV bleeding.

Methodology/Principal findings288 adult female patients were recruited from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Sri Lanka. All clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded throughout the duration of hospital admission along with treatment received.

28/288 (9.72%) reported PV bleeding, with 12/28 (42.85%) developing dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) compared to 65/260 (25%) of those who did not have bleeding.

Women who developed PV bleeding were more likely to have developed DHF (OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.98 to 5.1, p=0.06), abdominal pain (OR=2.17, 95% CI = 0.99 to 4.69, p = 0.06), vomiting (OR= 2.0, 95% CI= 0.89 to 4.44, p= 0.10), diarhoea (OR= 4.35, 95% CI = 1.908 to 9.610, p= 0.0004) or evidence of any fluid leakage (OR= 1.98, 95% CI = 0.91 to 4.5, p = 0.11). Although not significant, those who had PV bleeding were more likely to have been given intravenous fluids, blood transfusions and colloids.

ConclusionsPV bleeding appears to associate with worse disease outcomes. The possible contribution of PV bleeding to higher incidence of severe dengue and fatality rates observed in many countries, should be further investigated.

We discovered that pearling imposes a characteristic length scale, simultaneously mediating nucleoid disaggregation and establishing inter-nucleoid distancing with near-maximally achievable precision. Cristae invaginations play a dual role: lamellar cristae density determines pearling frequency and duration, and preserves the resulting nucleoid spacing after recovery. The distribution of mitochondrial genomes is thus fundamentally governed by the interplay between spontaneous pearling and cristae ultrastructure.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576978

The emergence of single-cell multi-omics technologies has driven the development of several methods that integrate transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to infer GRNs. While these methods provide examples of their utility in discovering new regulatory interactions, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their mechanistic and predictive properties as well as their ability to recover known interactions is lacking. To address this, we built a comprehensive framework, Gene Regulatory nETwork Analysis (GRETA), available as a Snakemake pipeline, that includes state of the art methods decomposing their different steps in a modular manner. With it, we found that the GRNs were highly sensitive to methods choices, such as changes in random seeds, or replacing steps in the inference pipelines, as well as whether they use paired or unpaired multimodal data. Although the obtained networks performed moderately well in predictive evaluation tasks and partially recovered known interactions, they struggled to capture causal relationships from perturbation assays. Our work brings attention to the challenges of inferring GRNs from single-cell omics, offers guidelines, and presents a flexible framework for developing and testing new approaches.

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe - a specialised slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behaviour and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

While cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD+ depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification-based anti-phage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Yet, understanding the determinants of niche partitioning within SAR11 has been a formidable challenge due to the high genetic diversity within individual SAR11 sublineages and the limited availability of high-quality genomes from both cultivation and metagenomic reconstruction. Here, we take advantage of 71 new SAR11 genomes from strains we isolated from the tropical Pacific Ocean to evaluate the distribution of metabolic traits across the Pelagibacteraceae, a recently classified family within the order Pelagibacterales encompassing subgroups Ia and Ib. Our analyses of metagenomes generated from stations where the strains were isolated reveals distinct habitat preferences across SAR11 genera for coastal or offshore environments, and subtle but systematic differences in metabolic potential that support these observations. We also observe higher levels of selective forces acting on habitat-specific metabolic genes linked to SAR11 fitness and polyphyletic distributions of habitat preferences and metabolic traits across SAR11 subclades, suggesting that contrasting lifestyles have emerged across multiple lineages independently. Together, these insights reveal niche-partitioning within sympatric and parapatric populations of SAR11 and demonstrate that the immense genomic diversity of SAR11 bacteria naturally segregates into ecologically and genetically cohesive units, or ecotypes, that vary in spatial distributions in the tropical Pacific.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Despite the critical importance of antibodies in a wide range of areas of biomedical significance, the traditional process of antibody discovery is limited by inefficiency, high costs and failure rates, fundamental logistical hurdles, limited scalability potential, and long turnaround times. Recent computational biology efforts, including machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, have proven to have critical capabilities and advantages over purely experimental techniques, disrupting a number of areas that have traditionally met with limited success, such as protein structure modeling, enzyme engineering, drug design, and others (1-3). In the context of antibodies, AI-based approaches have been developed to optimize existing antibodies and generate novel antibody sequences in a target-agnostic manner (4-6). However, the ability of AI approaches to generate novel paired antibody sequences against a specific target (antigen) of interest has not been validated. In this work, we present MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody GEnerator), a sequence-based protein Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for the task of generating paired variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences against antigens of interest. Here we show that MAGE is capable of efficiently generating diverse antibody sequences that are distinct from the antibody sequences found in the training datasets, with experimentally validated binding specificity against SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), an emerging avian influenza H5N1 viral hemagglutinin (H5), and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) prefusion F. MAGE is trained on protein sequence alone and requires only an antigen sequence as input for antibody design, with no need for a preexisting antibody template. MAGE represents a first-in-class model capable of designing human antibodies with demonstrated functionality against multiple targets. AI models for generation of human antibodies will provide unique and disruptive capabilities in the far-reaching field of antibody science.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

For this study, we analyzed participant genomic variant data to assess the extent of population structure and to characterize patterns of genetic ancestry for the All of Us cohort (n=297,549). Unsupervised clustering of genomic principal component analysis (PCA) data revealed a non-uniform distribution of genetic diversity and substantial population structure in the All of Us cohort, with dense clusters of closely related participants interspersed among less dense regions of genomic PC space. Supervised genetic ancestry inference was performed using genetic similarity between All of Us participants and global reference population samples. Participants show diverse genetic ancestry, with major contributions from European (66.4%), African (19.5%), Asian (7.6%), and American (6.3%) continental ancestry components. Participant genetic similarity clusters show group-specific genetic ancestry patterns, with distinct patterns of continental and subcontinental ancestry among groups. We also explored how genetic ancestry changes over space and time in the United States (US). African and American ancestry are enriched in the southeast and southwest regions of the country, respectively, whereas European ancestry is more evenly distributed across the US. The diversity of All of Us participants genetic ancestry is negatively correlated with age; younger participants show higher levels of genetic admixture compared to older participants.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576978

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by climate change-induced seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. The present study utilizes the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter gene showed significant upregulation, indicating that these regulatory sequences are indeed responsive to thermal stress. Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

While case studies suggest that population history can also affect specific structures of languages, such as patterns in their sound systems and grammars, results are conflicting, and it remains unknown whether such effects hold globally. Here we show that, adjusting for geography, phylogeny, and environment, genetic diversity is inversely correlated with diversity in linguistic structures. Low genetic diversity (i.e. excess homozygosity) results from relative isolation, and this promotes diversification in language. High genetic diversity results from contact and migration, and this promotes homogenization in language. These effects are particularly pronounced in Asia and, under some conditions, also in a few other areas, suggesting sociocultural factors contributing to differences in how strongly isolation favors linguistic diversity and how strongly contact promotes linguistic homogenization. Our results suggest that present-day hotspots of linguistic diversity, which are characterized by relative isolation, may provide a privileged window on the dynamics of linguistic evolution as they are less affected by the vast demographic expansions, migrations, and extinctions that characterize the Neolithic age.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

We show that gas vesicles (GVs), natural air filled protein nanostructures, preferentially accumulate in brain tumors following systemic administration in syngeneic and xenograft mouse models of GBM. This enables real-time tumor visualization during surgery and postoperative monitoring of recurrence. We characterize GV uptake and breakdown by tumors and their resident cells and support clinical translatability by documenting non toxic repeated administration. We also demonstrate the potential for post-operative monitoring in humans by imaging GVs through a human skull and an FDA approved skull prosthesis. Acoustic tumor paint has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve surgical outcomes, make monitoring more accessible, and extend survival in GBM patients.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

While contemporary research has somewhat advanced our understanding of DMT, and psychedelics more broadly, there is little research that integrates time-resolved measures of subjective experience with temporally fine-grained brain imaging. We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

We found that the translation initiation factor EIF4A1, which unwinds complex mRNA structures in the 5 UTR of oncogenic transcripts, is highly expressed in AML stem- and progenitor-like cells. Inhibiting eIF4A with the small molecule Zotatifin reduces translation of transcripts related to the cell cycle and survival. This results in downregulation of AKT, STAT-5, and MCL-1 and underlies synergy of Zotatifin with Venetoclax. The drug combination promotes apoptosis across AML genotypes, while the effect on healthy blood cells is limited.

However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback4.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

However, pathogen effectors can evolve to avoid immune recognition, resulting in devastating diseases that threaten global agriculture. Here, we show that an integrated Exo70 domain from the barley NLR RGH2 can interact with both the rice blast pathogen effector AVR-Pii and a closely related wheat blast variant. We used structure-led engineering to develop RGH2+ that shows increased binding affinity towards AVR-Pii variants and increased cell death responses on heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Infection assays in transgenic barley lines harbouring RGH2+ (along with the paired NLR RGH3) show reduced virulence towards blast strains expressing AVR-Pii variants. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering NLR receptors as an effective strategy for improving resistance towards one of the most destructive diseases affecting cereal production.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

However, no current computational model explains V4 responses under natural conditions. To address this, we developed a new hierarchical convolutional energy (HCE) model reflecting computations thought to occur in areas V1, V2, and V4, but which consists entirely of simple- and complex-like units like those found in V1. In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Existing tools for uncovering co-evolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared evolutionary history. Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' and assign them to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only consider phylogenetically independent altered gap characters. Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. We employ an MSA-masking approach to mitigate misleading artifacts from poorly aligned regions. When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying co-evolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including MCC, AUC, and F1 score.

In an OPM, the sample space is mapped to a distortion free image space via remote focusing, and the oblique light-sheet plane is mapped via a tilted tertiary imaging system onto a camera. As a result, the 3D point-spread function and optical transfer function are tilted to the optical axis of the tertiary imaging system. To satisfy Nyquist sampling, small scanning steps are required to encompass the tilted 3D OTF, slowing down acquisition and increasing sample exposure. Here we show that a judicious amount of under-sampling can lead to a form of aliasing in OPM that can be recovered without a loss of spatial resolution or introducing artifacts. The resulting speed gain depends on the optical parameters of the system and can reach 2-4-fold in our demonstrations. We leverage this speed gain for rapid subcellular 3D imaging of mitochondrial dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by system size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain remarkably stable across a broad size range.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato.

Using microfluidics and single cell imaging, we discover that flow promotes growth of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa at surprisingly low nutrient concentrations. In static environments, cells require high nutrient concentrations as they steadily consume non-renewable resources. In flowing environments, cells grow robustly at very low nutrient concentrations that are constantly replenished. Our simulation-guided experiments show how stopping flow halts growth within minutes and varying flow impacts growth gradients across bacterial populations. By precisely delivering nutrients using microfluidics, we learned that cells in flow can grow on glucose concentrations 1,000 times lower than those observed in typical laboratory experiments. The ultralow glucose concentrations sufficient for growth in flow closely align with the affinity of bacterial glucose transporters, suggesting that bacteria have evolved in flowing environments with scarce nutrients. Collectively, our results emphasize the limits of traditional culturing approaches and highlight how depleted environments can unexpectedly support bacterial growth.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

How do viral RNAs avoid irreversible entanglement? One possibility is RNA sequestration into biomolecular condensates. To test this, we reconstituted critical SARS-CoV-2 RNA-RNA interactions in Nucleocapsid condensates. We observed that RNAs with low propensity RNA-RNA interactions resulted in more round, liquid-like condensates while those with high sequence complementarity resulted in more heterogeneous networked morphology independent of RNA structure stability. Residue-resolution molecular simulations and direct sequencing-based detection of RNA-RNA interactions support that these properties arise from degree of trans RNA contacts. We propose that extensive RNA-RNA interactions in cell and viral replication are controlled via a combination of genome organization, timing, RNA sequence content, RNA production ratios, and emergent biomolecular condensate material properties.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

The periosteum is typically quiescent, but upon fracture, periosteal cells proliferate and contribute to bone fracture repair. The expansion of the periosteum is regulated by gene transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms behind periosteal expansion are unclear. Here, we show that Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) mediate periosteal expansion and periosteal cell proliferation. Bone fracture increases the number of YAP-expressing periosteal cells, and deletion of YAP and TAZ from Osterix (Osx) expressing cells impairs early periosteal expansion. Mechanistically, YAP regulates both  cell-intrinsic and  cell-extrinsic factors that allow for periosteal expansion. Specifically, we identified Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) as a cell extrinsic factor regulated by YAP, that rescues the impairment of periosteal expansion upon YAP/TAZ deletion. Together, these data establish YAP mediated transcriptional mechanisms that induce periosteal expansion in the early stages of fracture repair and provide new putative targets for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

However, these computational methods are often tailored to specific scenarios and validated on limited datasets and metrics, making their evaluation and comparison challenging. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate in silico perturbation methods across four key scenarios: predicting effects of unseen perturbations in known cell types, predicting effects of observed perturbations in unseen cell types, zero-shot transfer to bulk RNA-seq of cell lines, and application to real-world biological cases. For each scenario, we curated diverse and abundant datasets, standardizing them into flexible formats to enable efficient analysis. Additionally, we developed multiple metrics tailored to each scenario, facilitating a thorough and comparative evaluation of these methods. Our benchmarking study assessed 10 methods, ranging from linear baselines to advanced machine learning approaches, across these scenarios. While some methods demonstrated surprising efficacy in specific contexts, significant challenges remain, particularly in zero-shot predictions and the modeling of complex biological processes.

Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in Drosophila cells that the mitotic kinase POLO phosphorylates PP187B at a conserved residue (T286) within a pocket implicated in the recognition of RVxF-containing target proteins. Phosphorylation of T286 inhibits PP187B binding to the RVxF motif of the SAC kinase MPS1, dampening the dephosphorylation of MPS1 T-loop. Phosphorylation of T286 is dynamically regulated during mitosis. It occurs at unattached/tensionless kinetochores and decreases as chromosomes congress. Expression of phosphomimetic PP187BT286D prevents MPS1 inactivation in metaphase and causes a SAC-dependent delay of anaphase onset. Conversely, an unphosphorylatable PP187BT286A mutant impairs MPS1 activation at unattached kinetochores and weakens the SAC. In vivo, larval neuroblasts expressing PP187BT286 phosphomutants exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy.

GeneSetCluster clusters gene-sets based on shared genes, providing a high-level overview of the involved biological pathways, thereby facilitating interpretability. However, the original version faced limitations in managing redundancies across multiple gene sets. Additionally, programmatic tools like GeneSetCluster can be challenging for users with limited coding expertise.

ResultsWe introduce GeneSetCluster 2.0 which substantially improves upon its predecessor. This update presents a new methodology for addressing duplicated gene-sets and incorporates a seriation-based clustering algorithm that reorders data, enabling the identification of patterns. The updated version is optimized for faster computational performance through parallelization, reducing execution times. Furthermore, the 2.0 version also enhances cluster annotation by identifying relevant tissues and biological processes associated with each cluster. Finally, to improve accessibility and usability, we have developed a user-friendly web application, making GeneSetCluster 2.0 suitable for a broader audience, including those without programming expertise.

To recapitulate events on the inner membrane, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model membrane and encapsulated proteins of interest inside GUVs, thus generating a membrane platform to which ATG8 proteins could be localised on the inner leaflet of the vesicles. We reconstituted WIPI2b-directed and cargo-directed ATG8 lipidation inside the GUVs and revealed distinct roles of WIPI2b and p62 in initiating the ATG conjugation cascade. Furthermore, we showed that p62 or p62 droplets were recruited to the inner membrane of the GUVs though interaction with membrane-bound ATG8s. Using a bead-based membrane expansion assay, we demonstrated a redistribution and local enrichment of membrane-bound ATG8s across the membrane upon interaction with p62 and p62 droplets. Our study provides novel model systems to investigate the interactions on the inner membrane of the phagophore and reveals fundamental molecular insights into phagophore membrane bending. This process is directed by ATG8-cargo interaction, during which cargo receptors concentrate ATG8 proteins on the inner surface of the phagophore membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Neurological symptoms include anxiety, depression and impaired short-term memory. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of long Covid are not yet decrypted. Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid. Conclusively, we provide evidence that virus-related and neurodegenerative and immunometabolic mechanisms coexist in the brainstem of infected hamsters and contribute to the manifestation of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms.

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576978

The inherently dim fluorescence and low signal-to-noise ratio of red-shifted GECIs have posed significant challenges. More critically, several red-fluorescent GECIs exhibit photoswitching when exposed to blue light, thereby limiting their applicability in all- optical experimental approaches. Here, we present the development of PinkyCaMP, the first mScarlet-based Ca2+ sensor that outperforms current red fluorescent sensors in brightness, photostability, signal-to-noise ratio, and compatibility with optogenetics and neurotransmitter imaging. PinkyCaMP is well-tolerated by neurons, showing no toxicity or aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo. All imaging approaches, including single-photon excitation methods such as fiber photometry, widefield imaging, miniscope imaging, as well as two-photon imaging in awake mice, are fully compatible with PinkyCaMP.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1735596576978

Here, we introduce Genomic Network Analysis (GNA), an analytic framework that applies the principles of network modelling to estimates of genetic overlap derived from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait. Extensive simulations establish GNA is well-powered for most GWAS. Application to a diverse set of traits demonstrate that GNA yields critical insight into the genetic architecture that demarcate genetically overlapping traits at varying levels of biological granularity.","NA","medrxiv",1735596576978

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.
