Their model predicted 63.3 million cases and 364,000 deaths, with a claimed 95% confidence interval of less than 1% of the estimated values. Objective: To validate the transmission model used by Kayano et al. by simulating infection counts in Japan during 2020 and assessing the impact of errors in the reproduction number of the Delta variant on infection count estimates in the counterfactual scenario. Methods: We replicated the model used by Kayano et al. to simulate infection dynamics in Japan during 2020. We evaluated the model's performance by comparing the simulated infection surges with actual data. Additionally, we analyzed the sensitivity of infection count estimates to {+/-}10% errors in the reproduction number of the Delta variant, corresponding to the 95% confidence interval reported in the cited study. Results: The model successfully reproduced the first infection surge in early 2020, but it failed to replicate the second and third infection surges in the summer and winter of 2020. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a {+/-}10% error in the reproduction number led to an estimated infection count error range of -25% to +42%. Conclusion: The results suggest potential limitations in the validity of the counterfactual simulation results presented by Kayano et al., particularly regarding the accuracy of infection count estimates and the confidence interval.","NA","medrxiv",1739657261235

We find rapid evolution of genome architecture, including ~100 Mb variation in genome size driven by dynamic satellite landscapes with unexpectedly long (> 10 kb) repeat units and widespread variation in gene content, influencing gene expression. SVs exhibit slightly deleterious dynamics modulated by variant length and population size, with strong evidence of adaptive fixation only in large populations.

In this context, windborne transmission, the idea that the virus can travel through the air over considerable distances, is a contentious concept and, documented cases are rare. Here, though, we provide genetic evidence supporting the feasibility of windborne transmission. During the 2023-24 HPAI season, molecular surveillance identified identical H5N1 strains among a cluster of unrelated commercial farms about 8 km apart in the Czech Republic. The episode started with the abrupt mortality of fattening ducks on one farm and was followed by disease outbreaks at two nearby high-biosecurity chicken farms. Using genetic, epizootiological, meteorological and geographical data, we reconstructed a mosaic of events strongly suggesting wind was the mechanism of infection transmission between poultry in at least two independent cases. By aligning the genetic and meteorological data with critical outbreak events, we determined the most likely time window during which the transmission occurred and inferred the sequence of infected houses at the recipient sites. Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation. Furthermore, they also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites. These findings underscore the importance of considering windborne spread in future outbreak mitigation strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

These can include blood pressure instability, hyperinflammation, coagulopathies, and neuropsychiatric complaints. The pathogenesis of these features remains unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) binds Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells to initiate infection. We hypothesized that some patients may produce anti-RBD antibodies that resemble ACE2 sufficiently to have ACE2-like catalytic activity, that is they are ACE2-like proteolytic abzymes that may help mediate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and LC. In previous work, we showed that some acute COVID-19 patients had immunoglobulin-associated ACE2-like proteolytic activity, suggesting that some COVID-19 patients indeed produced ACE2-like abzymes. However, it remained unknown whether ACE2-like abzymes were seen only in acute COVID-19 patients or whether ACE2-like abzymes could also be identified in convalescent COVID-19 patients.

Here, we assess the neutralizing activity of the authorized antibody pemivibart and the candidate antibody SA55 against major historical and currently dominant viral variants, including the JN.1 subvariants KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Our findings show that SA55 demonstrates broad neutralizing potency while pemivibart exhibits reduced neutralizing activity against currently dominant variants. Then we employ replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus with the JN.1 spike (rVSV{Delta}G-JN.1) to select escape variants of SA55. Following this, we conduct a systematic comparison of escape profiles for these two antibodies, revealing that SA55 is remarkably resilient to escape mutations under antibody selection, which is consistent with our SPR data indicating that SA55 possesses a substantially stronger binding affinity. Moreover, an immunobridging analysis suggests that SA55 may have superior clinical efficacy to pemivibart in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection under the current variant landscape. Together, this work highlights the promise of SA55 as a potential therapeutic option in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised populations.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

In contrast to folded proteins, IDRs lack a stable 3D structure and are instead described in terms of a conformational ensemble, a collection of energetically accessible interconverting structures. This unique structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function; thus, a convenient way to view IDRs is through their ensembles. Here, we combine advances in physics-based force fields for IDPs with the power of modern multi-scale generative modeling to develop STARLING, an approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of IDR ensembles directly from sequence. STARLING enables ensembles of hundreds of conformers to be generated in seconds and works on GPUs and CPUs. This, in turn, dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties in addition to traditional bioinformatic approaches. We evaluate STARLING's accuracy against experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function or the interpretation of experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

While models to predict personal attributes from a person's connectome are abundant, the inverse task-inferring connectome architecture from an individual's personal profile-has not been widely studied. Here, we introduce a deep model to generate a person's entire connectome exclusively based on their age, sex, body phenotypes, cognition, and lifestyle factors. Using the richly phenotyped UK Biobank connectome cohort (N=8,086), we demonstrate that our model can generate network architectures that closely recapitulate connectomes mapped empirically using diffusion MRI and tractography. We find that age, sex, and body phenotypes exert the strongest influence on the connectome generation process, with an impact approximately four times greater than that of cognition and lifestyle factors. Regional differences in the importance of measures were observed, including an increased importance of cognition in the association cortex relative to the visual system. We further show that generated connectomes can improve the training of machine learning models and reduce their predictive errors. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inferring brain connectivity from an individual's personal data and enables future applications of connectome generation such as data augmentation and anonymous data sharing.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

However, little is known about human IFN-{omega}, as most research on this interferon has been conducted in feline models.

Moreover, IFN-{omega} enhances the effector functions of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells primed de novo from healthy donor cells, highlighting its capacity to promote strong cellular immunity.

Both neutralising activity and effector function activity of Spike-specific antibodies have been shown to be important for their protective and therapeutic activity. However, several recent studies have reported that vaccination with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines can lead to elevated levels of Spike-specific IgG4, an isotype which is often considered anti-inflammatory due to its reduced binding to Fc{gamma} receptors on immune cells. Here we show that the level of Spike-specific IgG4 produced following BNT162b2 vaccination is impacted by the interval between and frequency of vaccines boosts, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (hybrid immunity), breakthrough infection and bivalent vaccine boosters. Despite the increase in Spike-specific IgG4 between the 2nd and 3rd BNT162b2 vaccine dose, neutralisation, ADCD and ADCP activity all increased. Through expression of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies cloned as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, we demonstrated that whilst Spike-specific IgG4 had reduced effector function activity, including ADCC, ADCD and ADCP, IgG4 was only inhibitory when directly competing with functional IgG subclasses binding to an overlapping epitope. In the context of polyclonal plasma, ADCC and ADCD activity could not be depleted by addition of high concentrations of a Spike-specific IgG4 mAb cocktail suggesting the non-stimulatory effect of Spike-specific IgG4 may be hidden in more complex scenarios, such as polyclonal mixes in serum.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

To investigate how animals perceive these intermittent cues, we developed a behavioral task in which head-restrained mice made binary decisions based on the total number of discrete odor pulses presented stochastically over several seconds. Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation. Our study reveals that mice can integrate intermittent odor signals across dozens of breaths, but respiratory modulation of sensory inputs imposes limits on information acquisition that cortical circuits cannot overcome to improve behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Many redundant muscle patterns can solve a given task, and this high dimensionality allows flexibility but poses a problem for efficient learning 4. Although a feasible solution invokes subcortical innate motor patterns, or primitives, to reduce the dimensionality of the control problem, how cortex learns to utilize such primitives remains an open question 5-7. To address this, we studied cortical and subcortical interactions as head-fixed mice learned contextual control of innate hindlimb extension behavior. Naive mice performed reactive extensions to turn off a cold air stimulus within seconds and, using predictive cues, learned to avoid the stimulus altogether in tens of trials. Optogenetic inhibition of large areas of rostral cortex completely prevented avoidance behavior, but did not impair hindlimb extensions in reaction to the cold air stimulus. Remarkably, mice covertly learned to avoid the cold stimulus even without any prior experience of successful, cortically-mediated avoidance. These findings support a dynamic, heterarchical model in which the dominant locus of control can change, on the order of seconds, between cortical and subcortical brain areas. We propose that cortex can leverage periods when subcortex predominates as demonstrations, to learn parameterized control of innate behavioral primitives.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

In this study, we created a mouse model of PD by overexpressing -synuclein through a combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the medial and lateral substantia nigra (SN). We also demonstrated that chronic administration of the c-Abl inhibitor PD180970 provides neuroprotection in this model. Mice injected with the AAV6--synuclein and PFF combination showed a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN and their projections in the striatum over 24 weeks. This neuronal loss coincided with a time-dependent accumulation of phosphorylated -synuclein (p-syn) in the SN. The p-syn aggregates spread to synaptically connected DARPP-32-positive neurons in the striatum and further extended to the cortex. We also observed a contralateral spread of p-syn aggregates. Additionally, -synuclein overexpression led to a significant increase in activated microglia and astrocytes at all timepoints, with the strongest activation occurring early and gradually diminishing over time. Daily administration of PD180970 significantly reduced the loss of DA neurons caused by -synuclein injection and decreased the accumulation of p-syn in the SN. PD180970 treatment also reduced the neuroinflammation significantly. Overall, the combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils into the mouse brain establishes a robust PD model, enabling detailed mechanistic studies of the disease. We further demonstrate the model's utility for chronic neuroprotection studies using the potential drug PD180970, highlighting its broad applicability.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Clearance occurs through both protein degradation and growth-dependent dilution. At slow growth, clearance is dominated by degradation, which leads to the accumulation of long lived proteins. At fast growth, however, it is dominated by dilution, preventing this accumulation. Thus, the concentration of long lived proteins will be reduced unless cells compensate by preferentially increasing synthesis rates. To determine the dominant regulatory mechanisms, we quantified the degree of compensation between activated and resting human B cells and across mouse tissues. The results indicate that growth-dependent dilution is insufficiently compensated for by changes in protein synthesis, and it accounts for over a third of the concentration changes between high and low growth conditions. Furthermore, we find that about 25 % of the differences in protein concentration across all tissues are controlled by protein clearance. When comparing only slowly growing tissues such as the brain and pancreas, clearance differences explain as much as 42 %. Within a tissue or cell type, clearance variation is sufficient to account for 50 % of the abundance variation for all measured proteins at slow growth, contrasted with 7 % at fast growth. Thus, our model unifies previous observations with our new results and highlights a context-dependent and larger than previously appreciated contribution of protein degradation in shaping protein variation both across the proteome and across cell states.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

CRISPR-based genetic screens have proven invaluable in elucidating gene function in mammalian cells. Single-cell functional genomics methods, such as Perturb-seq and Spear-ATAC, have made it possible to achieve high-throughput mapping of the functional effects of gene perturbations by profiling transcriptomes and DNA accessibility, respectively. Combining single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data via multiomic approaches has facilitated the discovery of novel cis and gene regulatory interactions. However, pseudobulk readouts from cell populations can often cloud the interpretation of results due to a heterogeneous response from cells receiving the same genetic perturbation, which could be mitigated by using transcriptional profiles of single cells to subset the ATAC-seq data. Existing methods to capture CRISPR guide RNAs to simultaneously assess the impact of genetic perturbations on RNA and ATAC profiles require either cloning of gRNA libraries in specialized vectors or implementing complex protocols with multiple rounds of barcoding. Here, we introduce CAT-ATAC, a technique that adds CRISPR gRNA capture to the existing 10X Genomics Multiome assay, generating paired transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and perturbation identity data from the same individual cells. We demonstrate up to 77% guide capture efficiency for both arrayed and pooled delivery of lentiviral gRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cancer cell lines. This capability allows us to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in cells under drug and genetic perturbations. By applying CAT-ATAC, we were able to identify a GRN associated with dasatinib resistance, indirectly activated by the HIC2 gene.

Elucidating the biologic underpinnings of LC could identify therapeutic opportunities. We utilized machine learning methods on biologic analytes and patient reported outcome surveys provided over 12 months after hospital discharge from >500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the IMPACC cohort to identify a multi-omics 'recovery factor'. IMPACC participants who experienced LC had lower recovery factor scores compared to participants without LC. Biologic characterization revealed increased levels of plasma proteins associated with inflammation, elevated transcriptional signatures of heme metabolism, and decreased androgenic steroids in LC patients. The recovery factor was also associated with altered circulating immune cell frequencies. Notably, recovery factor scores were predictive of LC occurrence in patients as early as hospital admission, irrespective of acute disease severity. Thus, the recovery factor identifies patients at risk of LC early after SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals LC biomarkers and potential treatment targets.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

This genetic variation is vital for populations to adapt to their environments, but it is also surprising given that nature (after all) ''selects'' the best genotypes at the expense of those that fall short. Explaining the extensive genetic variation of fitness-related traits is thus a longstanding puzzle in evolutionary biology, with cascading implications for ecology, conservation, and human health. Balancing selection--an umbrella term for scenarios of natural selection that maintain genetic variation--is a century-old explanation to resolve this paradox that has gained recent momentum from genome-scale methods for detecting it. Yet evaluating whether balancing selection can, in fact, resolve the paradox is challenging, given the logistical constraints of distinguishing balancing selection from alternative hypotheses and the daunting collection of theoretical models that formally underpin this debate. Here, we track the development of balancing selection theory over the last century and provide an accessible review of this rich collection of models. We first outline the range of biological scenarios that can generate balancing selection. We then examine how fundamental features of genetic systems--including non-random mating between individuals, differences in ploidy, genetic drift, and different genetic architectures of traits--have been progressively incorporated into the theory. We end by linking these theoretical predictions to ongoing empirical efforts to understand the evolutionary processes that explain genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Influenza co-infections can result in re-assortant viruses that contain gene segments from multiple strains, causing pandemic outbreaks with severe consequences for human health. The outcome of re-assortment is likely influenced by a selective sequence-specific genome packaging mechanism.

To uncover the contributions of individual segment pairings to selective packaging, we set out to statistically analyse packaging defects and inter-segment distances in individual A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) virus particles. To enable such analysis, we developed a multiplexed DNA-PAINT approach capable of assessing the segment stoichiometry of more than 10,000 individual virus particles in one experiment; our approach can also spatially resolve the individual segments inside complete virus particles with a localisation precision of ~10 nm.

Our results show the influenza genome can be assembled through multiple pathways in a redundant and cooperative process guided by preferentially interacting segment pairs and aided by synergistic effects that enhance genome assembly, driving it to completion. Our structural evidence indicates that the interaction strength of segment pairs affects the spatial configuration of the gene segments, which appears to be preserved in mature virions. As our method quantified the interactions of whole influenza segments instead of identifying individual sequence-based interactions, our results can serve as a template to quantify the contributions of individual sequence motifs to selective packaging.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Chronic- restraint stress (CRS) and ethanol intake are independently known to induce changes in brain structure and function, however, their combined effects on neurodevelopment over long periods of time remains largely unexplored. We conducted an in vivo longitudinal rat model with three main goals. 1) to determine if chronic stress increases ethanol intake; 2) to determine the effect of chronic- stress and ethanol intake in behavioral measures, brain structure, and function; and 3) to investigate the effect of sex. This observational study included Wistar rats assigned to four groups: 1) ethanol consumption (EtOH+/CRS-), 2) stress exposure (EtOH-/CRS+), 3) both ethanol and stress exposure (EtOH+/CRS+), and 4) control group (EtOH-/CRS-). Our results showed that chronic stress did not affect ethanol intake but led to reduced body weight gain, elevated corticosterone levels, and impaired recognition memory. Structural MRI revealed that both exposures produced additive brain volume changes in regions such as the olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics identified disrupted cortical-subcortical connections. Results found here were sex-dependent in terms of volumetric changes (higher effects on males) and functional connectivity (higher effects on females). Findings suggest sex-dependent mechanisms where both chronic- ethanol intake and stress affect brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. Understanding these region-specific vulnerabilities is crucial for addressing alcohol use disorders and stress-related neuropathology.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Residents of Sydney have reported increasing cases of bin-opening behavior by sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), with evidence this behavior is socially learned between birds. Households protected their bins, yet cockatoos have learned to defeat these defences. In response, residents increase their defence-level, setting the stage for a behavioral ""arms race"". Here, we investigate this arms race by combining field observations with agent-based modeling. We systematically document protections in a suburban locality over two years, revealing spatial clustering of protections indicative of social learning among residents. We find that protections have decreased since 2019, and overly-costly protection is dispreferred. With a controlled assay, we characterize the knowledge of local cockatoos, finding differential proficiency in defeating protections. Surprisingly, we identified several cockatoos that can defeat high-efficacy protections, such as locks. Finally, we simulate interactions between two populations of learning agents representing households and cockatoos. We find that social learning accelerates adaptation in both species, while coordination reduces costs associated with defensive escalation. However, policy interventions can have unintended consequences, accelerating cockatoos skill acquisition and shifting conflict to neighboring areas. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of human-wildlife conflict and the importance of considering behavioral feedback loops in urban wildlife management.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Nascent proteins can begin to fold on their parent ribosome but formation of the native state is often inhibited well beyond the emergence of the necessary residues from the exit tunnel. The dominant forces driving this apparent destabilisation have remained unclear. We investigate this here, combining NMR experiments and atomistic simulations of a folded nascent chain on and off the ribosome. While its native structure and internal dynamics remain unaltered, co-translational folding is disfavoured due to intermolecular electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ribosome surface and nascent protein. Partially folded intermediates are less destabilised, resulting in their high populations. Specifically, we show that the polypeptide's net charge is the dominant factor determining nascent folding thermodynamics, with smaller contributions from charge distribution. Consequently, positively charged proteins can fold on the ribosome without populating stable intermediates. These findings reconcile conflicting observations of previous studies and establish the general physical principles underpinning de novo protein folding.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Understanding the neural mechanism of cognitive reserve could help assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of interventions in AD. To address this, here, 38 elderly participants performed a sustained attention task during high-density EEG while awake and during drowsiness. Operationally, the degree to which performance was impaired under drowsiness signalled the extent of cognitive reserve, with less impairment indicating a higher level of cognitive reserve. Investigating performance variations during the active management of neural challenges offers a novel approach to studying cognitive reserve, capturing dynamics that mirror everyday cognitive demand. We related cognitive reserve to various measures, including informational complexity using the Lempel-Ziv (LZSUM) algorithm. We found a significant interaction effect between arousal and performance, where LZSUM values increased in high performers when drowsy but decreased in low performers. This effect was most pronounced in the frontal and central areas. Our findings suggest LZSUM to be indicative of a compensatory mechanism and thus show potential for LZSUM as a neural marker in assessing cognitive reserve. However, we found no consistent relationship between performance and structural brain measures, and proxies of cognitive reserve. Critically, our findings present a counterexample to the prevailing view that informational complexity purely reflects conscious level. Further research, such as a study with the same paradigm in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may lead to additional insights of whether we are truly measuring cognitive reserve.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

However, the field currently lacks consistently curated datasets with accurate labels, especially for non-coding variants, that are necessary to comprehensively benchmark these models and advance the field. In this work, we present TraitGym, a curated dataset of regulatory genetic variants that are either known to be causal or are strong candidates across 113 Mendelian and 83 complex traits, along with carefully constructed control variants.

MRSA strains are resistant to front-line beta-lactams due to PBP2a, a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein encoded by mecA. Daptomycin is used to treat MRSA infections but is not always effective and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Understanding why daptomycin fails is crucial to devising strategies to improve treatment outcomes. Here, using a panel of clinical bacteraemia isolates, we show that MRSA strains are less susceptible to daptomycin than methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. This difference in susceptibility was due to mecA and was independent of any changes in surface properties previously associated with altered daptomycin susceptibility. Instead, using a mecA transposon mutant, we found that a lack of this gene led to higher activity of the Agr quorum sensing system, resulting in an increased release of the phenol-soluble modulin toxins. Increased levels of these surfactant-like toxins prevented daptomycin from being inactivated by lipids released by the bacteria, leading to enhanced susceptibility to the antibiotic. Additionally, the clinical MRSA strains tested produced lower levels of toxins than the MSSA strains and inactivated daptomycin to a greater extent, explaining their reduced susceptibility. Expression of mecA in clinical MSSA strains reduced toxin production, increasing daptomycin inactivation and thereby enhancing survival. Together, these results demonstrate that mecA does not only affect beta-lactam susceptibility but also compromises the efficacy of the last resort antibiotic daptomycin.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

One physiological change during the vertebrate stress response is the release of glucocorticoid hormones. Here, we measured plasma corticosterone in female domesticated budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to test whether human presence, restraint, or removal and return of a newly stressed neighbor increases corticosterone. The presence of humans for 15 minutes at the beginning of the experiment did not significantly elevate corticosterone above baseline levels, suggesting that birds that acclimate to humans are minimally affected by their presence. However, at the end of the experiment after multiple blood sampling events, the same human presence test significantly elevated corticosterone above baseline and human presence levels measured at the beginning of the experiment. Thus, repeated blood sampling could cause progressively stronger stress responses to human presence. Restraint-induced corticosterone levels were significantly higher than all other treatments, indicating that human handling activates the stress response. After stressed birds were returned home, corticosterone levels of their neighbors were significantly higher than baseline at 25- and 45-minutes post-return. However, the 25- and 45-minute corticosterone levels were not significantly different from each other, or levels induced by human presence at the beginning or end of the experiment. This outcome suggests that social transmission of stress was limited across the sampled time frame. These data highlight the importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of different human-animal interactions in captivity, including in domesticated species that are more tolerant of forced proximity to humans.

We studied the dynamics of evidence integration in a two-player game with volatile hidden states. Both humans and monkeys successfully updated their beliefs while playing the game and observing their partner, though less effectively when observing. Electrophysiological recordings in animals revealed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) integrates independent sources of experiential and observational evidence into a coherent neural representation of dynamic belief about the environment's state. The geometry of population activity revealed the computational architecture of this integration and provided a neural account of the behavioral asymmetry between experiential and observational evidence accumulation. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying evidence accumulation in social contexts within the primate brain.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

However, engineering proteins with desired functions for practical applications remains slow, expensive, and specialist-dependent. Here we report a generally applicable platform for autonomous protein engineering that integrates machine learning and large language models with biofoundry automation to eliminate the need for human intervention, judgement, and domain expertise. Requiring only an input protein sequence and a quantifiable way to measure fitness, this autonomous platform can be applied to engineer virtually any protein. As a proof of concept, we engineered Arabidopsis thaliana halide methyltransferase (AtHMT) for a 90-fold improvement in substrate preference and 16-fold improvement in ethyltransferase activity, along with developing a Yersinia mollaretii phytase (YmPhytase) variant with 26-fold improvement in activity at neutral pH. This was accomplished in four rounds over four weeks, while requiring construction and characterization of fewer than a total of 500 variants for each enzyme. This platform for autonomous experimentation paves the way for rapid advancements across diverse industries, from medicine and biotechnology to renewable energy and sustainable chemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Recently, computational modeling has emerged as a promising approach for characterizing sources of this heterogeneity, which could potentially aid in clinical differentiation. In this study, we tested whether computational mechanisms of decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) - where behavior is expected to have both positive and negative outcomes - may have utility in this regard. We first carried out a set of pre-registered modeling analyses in a sample of 480 individuals who completed an established AAC task. These analyses aimed to replicate cross-sectional and longitudinal results from a prior dataset (N=478) - suggesting that mechanisms of decision uncertainty (DU) and emotion conflict (EC) differentiate individuals with depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and healthy comparisons. We then combined the prior and current datasets and employed a stacked machine learning approach to assess whether these computational measures could successfully perform out-of-sample classification between diagnostic groups. This revealed above-chance differentiation between affective and substance use disorders (balanced accuracy > 0.688), both in the presence and absence of co-morbidities. These results demonstrate the predictive utility of computational measures in characterizing distinct mechanisms of psychopathology and may point to novel treatment targets.","NA","medrxiv",1739657261235

However, they also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

MethodsWe consider genetic variants in the region of the HMGCR gene, which encodes the target of statins, and their associations with downstream consequences of statins. We use various statistical methods to identify causal pathways influencing CAD and T2D, and investigate whether these are the same or different for the two diseases.

ResultsColocalization analyses indicated that LDL-C and body mass index (BMI) have distinct genetic predictors in this gene region, suggesting that they do not lie on the same causal pathway. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses restricted to variants in the HMGCR gene region revealed LDL-C and BMI as causal risk factors for CAD, and BMI as a causal risk factor for T2D, but not LDL-C. A Bayesian model averaging method prioritized BMI as the most likely causal risk factor for T2D, and LDL-C as the second most likely causal risk factor for CAD (behind ubiquinone). Colocalization analyses provided consistent evidence of LDL-C colocalizing with CAD, and BMI colocalizing with T2D; evidence was inconsistent for colocalization of LDL-C with T2D, and BMI with CAD.

ConclusionsOur analyses suggest cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of statin usage are on different causal pathways, and hence could be influenced separately by targeted interventions. More broadly, our analysis workflow offers potential insights to identify pathway-specific causal risk factors that could provide possible repositioning or refinement opportunities for existing drug targets.

Key messagesO_LIWe performed colocalization and cis-multivariable Mendelian randomization using genetic association data for variants in the HMGCR gene region to investigate causal pathways influencing coronary artery disease (CAD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D)
C_LIO_LIOur analyses suggest that the impact of HMGCR inhibition on CAD risk is mediated by both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and body mass index (BMI), whereas for T2D, risk was mediated via BMI but not LDL-C.
C_LIO_LIOur results suggest the possibility that targeted treatments could be developed to inhibit HMGCR in a more specific way that lowers CAD risk without increasing T2D risk.

While considerable progress has been made in decoding phonetic features of speech, our ability to extract lexical semantic information (i.e. the meaning of individual words) from neural activity remains largely unexplored. Moreover, most existing BCI research has relied on controlled experimental paradigms rather than natural conversation, limiting our understanding of semantic decoding in ecological contexts. Here, we investigated the feasibility of decoding lexical semantic information from stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) recordings in 14 participants during spontaneous conversation. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we were able to decode word level semantic features during language production with an average accuracy of 21% across all participants compared to a chance level of 10%. This semantic decoding remained robust across different semantic representations while maintaining specificity to semantic features. Further, we identified a distributed left-lateralized network spanning precentral gyrus, pars triangularis, and middle temporal cortex, with low-frequency oscillations showing stronger contributions. Together, our results establish the feasibility of extracting word meanings from neural activity during natural speech production and demonstrate the potential for decoding semantic content from unconstrained speech.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

One key impediment to successful treatment outcomes is increased drug craving that occurs over the course of abstinence and subsequent relapse to drug use. This phenomenon, known as the incubation of drug craving, has been modeled extensively in rodent models of intravenous drug self-administration. As commonly implemented, the design of intravenous self-administration preclinical studies precludes disentangling appetitive and consummatory behaviors as drug seeking (appetitive) and taking (consummatory) is simultaneous. Here, we employed a model of oral cocaine self-administration to interrogate the incubation of drug vs nondrug craving, where the route of administration is identical between reinforcers and appetitive and consummatory behaviors are dissociable. Oral self-administration of cocaine produced detectable levels of cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, within the blood and brain, and blood and brain levels of both substrates correlated with cocaine consumption. When tested for seeking-(lever pressing) and taking-related (magazine head entries) behavior after 1 or 21 days of forced abstinence from cocaine or saccharin, we observed incubation of lever pressing among cocaine-administering mice and incubation of magazine entries among saccharin-administering mice. These behavioral changes were accompanied by reduced expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of cocaine self-administering mice, regardless of abstinence. Altogether, these results underscore the utility of this model of cocaine self-administration, highlight the conserved nature of incubated cocaine seeking across routes of administration, and demonstrate the dissociable neurobehavioral sequelae of the incubation of reward seeking across reinforcer types.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

However, the mechanisms driving its adherence to skin remain poorly understood. Here, we developed in vitro systems to allow for detailed analysis of early skin colonization events and identified critical host and pathogen mediators of attachment. Across multiple strains and clades of C. auris, we identified that Als4112, a conserved adhesin, is required for skin colonization via keratinocyte attachment and direct interactions with host extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, especially basement membrane proteins such as laminin. In a murine epicutaneous infection and human skin explants, deletion of ALS4112 significantly reduced skin colonization, underscoring its essential role in establishing cutaneous persistence. Als4112 also contributes to systemic infection, highlighting the connection between adherence and pathogenicity in this organism. Finally, coating plastic and catheter surfaces with collagen I or III markedly inhibited C. auris attachment and biofilm formation, offering an approach to curb nosocomial transmission. Our study highlights the critical role of Als4112 in C. auris colonization and virulence in vivo, making it an attractive target for future vaccine development.

Although the genome offers numerous potential binding sites for each TF, only a subset is actually bound in vivo, and of these, only a fraction is functionally relevant. For instance, some TFs bind to their specific sites due to synergistic interactions with other factors nearby. This integration provides users with a comprehensive list of potential candidates as well as aids users in ranking candidate genes and determining condition-specific TF binding for studying transcriptional regulation in Drosophila.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Research to date has focused on quantifying this acceleration, and localizing it in the chain of perceptual and cognitive processes that are involved. This is challenging, because these processes may interact unexpectedly, and because traditional (univariate) analyses of brain activity and behaviour may conflate processes with the representations they act on. By using multivariate pattern analysis of EEG data from a missing element task, designed to measure the visual temporal integration of two successive stimulus displays, we were able to track the representation associated with the integrated percept. We manipulated the delay between our displays, and observed commensurate acceleration of the resultant integrated representation. Furthermore, regardless of the delay, we found that although processing was already accelerated during the earliest processing stages at around 100ms after stimulus onset, intermediate stages, at around 200ms, were even more accelerated. In contrast, later processing stages, at around 400ms, again showed less acceleration. The results thus suggest that perceptual acceleration during temporal integration is nonlinear, and that some time that is gained at one moment in the process can be lost again at another.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Yet, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing biofilm formation remains incomplete, limiting the development of targeted interventions against biofilm-associated infections. By selecting for Vibrio cholerae biofilms, we identified mutations in the polyamine-regulated, bifunctional enzyme MbaA that alter its enzymatic activity in metabolizing the conserved second messenger cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). These mutations occur in both the c-di-GMP-producing GGDEF domain and the c-di-GMP- hydrolyzing EAL domain of MbaA. Mutagenesis and enzyme kinetic analyses revealed regulatory crosstalk between these domains, where mutations in either domain enhanced production of c-di-GMP by MbaA while concurrently reducing its hydrolytic activity. In the wild- type enzyme, c-di-GMP metabolism is regulated by specific polyamines. Biofilm-evolved mutations not only shift MbaAs enzymatic activity but also disrupt this post-translational regulation, rendering the enzyme insensitive to external polyamine signaling. Our findings illustrate how evolutionary pressure can rewire existing enzymes, driving a transition from a planktonic to a biofilm-associated lifestyle.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

However, while Bayesian integration provides a powerful explanatory framework, the question remains as to what extent it explains human behaviour in naturalistic situations, including more complex movements and distributions. Here, we examine whether humans can learn bimodal priors in a complex sensorimotor task: returning tennis serves. Participants returned serves in an immersive virtual reality setup with realistic movements and spatiotemporal task demands matching those in real tennis. The location of the opponents serves followed a bimodal distribution. We manipulated visual uncertainty through three levels of ball speeds: slow, moderate, and fast. After extensive exposure to the opponents serves, participants movements were biased by the bimodal prior distribution. As predicted by Bayesian theory, the magnitude of the bias depends on visual uncertainty. Additionally, our data indicate that participants movements in this complex task were not only biased by prior expectations but also by biomechanical constraints and associated motor costs. Intriguingly, an explicit knowledge test after the experiment revealed that, despite incorporating prior knowledge of the opponents serve distribution into their behaviour, participants were not explicitly aware of the pattern.

To explore the potential for cross-tolerance, we first adapted Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high concentrations of six single metals in a short-term evolutionary rescue experiment. We then measured the cross-tolerance of each metal-adapted line in the other five metals. We generated and tested three predictors for the degree of cross-tolerance, based on the similarity between pairs of metal environments in (1) their physiochemical properties, (2) the overlap in genes known to impact tolerance to both metals, and (3) their co-occurrence in the environment. None of these predictors explained significant variation in cross-tolerance. Instead, we observed that adapted lines in one metal were frequently cross-tolerant to certain metals (manganese and nickel) and intolerant to others (cobalt and zinc). Furthermore, cross-tolerance between pairs of metals was not reciprocal, with mutations accumulating in one metal (e.g., copper) providing adaptation to another metal (e.g., manganese), but not vice versa. Evolved lines also differed in their degree of specialization, with lines evolved in manganese or copper more specialized to that metal, but lines evolved in cobalt or zinc more generally tolerant. To determine the genetic basis of these metal adaptations, we sequenced the genomes of 109 metal-adapted yeast lines. The SNP mutation spectrum was significantly different in cadmium, cobalt, and manganese than expected in a mutation accumulation experiment in S. cerevisiae. In addition, two lines were highly mutated, bearing defects in DNA repair genes (both in manganese). Thirteen genes exhibited parallel adaptation to different metals; three of these genes generated broad cross-tolerance. Several mutations were found in vacuolar transporter genes, suggesting an important role for vacuolar proteins in adapting to metal stress. Our results with these metal-adapted lines indicate that cross-tolerance is challenging to predict, depending on the combined stressors experienced and the nature of the mutations involved.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

We fitted to expected P value distributions and simulated these distributions with and without assuming changes in statistical power over time. Average P values decreased from 2000 to 2024, as did the fraction just below the 0.05 threshold. Fits to models indicate that statistical power increased. Increasing power would reduce average P value while also decreasing P values near the 0.05 threshold--precisely the trends observed in epidemiology journals. Although the frequency of P values near the 0.05 threshold has declined modestly, this likely reflects increases in statistical power rather than decreases in P hacking.","NA","medrxiv",1739657261235

Since parvalbumin-containing GABAergic interneuron function in cortex and hippocampus is compromised in schizophrenia, and perineuronal nets (PNNs) facilitate the functioning of these cells, we tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoids, as stress mediators that can access the foetal compartment, might influence the expression of PNN component genes. In cultured mouse cortical neurons, we detected effects of hydrocortisone on many PNN component genes, via diverse mechanisms. A rapid (<4h), glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated suppression of neurocan and hyaluronan synthase (Has) 1 and 3 mRNAs was observed at 7 days in vitro (DIV), whereas at 14DIV, brevican and versican expression was reduced by hydrocortisone without GR involvement, while GR inhibition elevated Has1 and Has2 mRNA levels and suppressed aggrecan mRNA levels. Tenascin R expression was rapidly suppressed by hydrocortisone at 7DIV but not at 14. At 21DIV, PNN component gene expression had become insensitive to hydrocortisone, although parvalbumin expression was reduced after 24h but not 4h exposure. Additionally, effects on protein levels were observed that were sometimes consistent with the mRNA changes (e.g. Has3, Gad1) and sometimes unrelated to them (e.g. elevated TnR levels at 14DIV after glucocorticoid receptor antagonism). We found that hydrocortisone could directly inhibit proteasome activity, potentially explaining the ability of hydrocortisone to increase Has2 levels. As expected from these results, the overall structure of the PNN was compromised by hydrocortisone exposure, with the length of proximal dendrite covered by PNN being reduced. Overall, the data demonstrate a complex and profound, but developmental stage-dependent, regulation of PNN component gene expression by glucocorticoids. This may contribute to the action of severe prenatal or perinatal stress to increase schizophrenia risk.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

We do this based on a series of piecemeal GWASs of segments of a target (continuous) trait distribution, and the genetic correlations between those GWASs and a second trait. Simulations confirm that we are able to retrieve the shape of the relationship given certain assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the traits. We applied the method to the genetic relationship between BMI, sleep duration, and height, and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and depression) using data from approximately 450K individuals from UK Biobank. In the relationship between BMI and psychiatric traits, we found that the expected value of depression is a nonlinear function of BMI i.e. there is a nonlinear genetic relationship between both traits. We observed similar findings for the genetic relationship between BMI and anorexia, sleep duration and depression, and sleep duration and ADHD. We observed no underlying nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between height and psychiatric traits. Using a novel statistical approach, we show that nonlinear genetic relationships between traits are detectable and genetic associations as quantified using global estimators like genetic correlations are not informative about underlying complexities in these relationships. Our findings challenge assumptions of linearity in genetic epidemiology and suggest that bivariate genetic associations are not uniform across the phenotypic spectrum, which may have implications for the development of targeted interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

The tropical bont tick, Amblyomma variegatum, is a significant natural vector of Ehrlichia ruminantium, the causative agent of heartwater. This disease is endemic in many countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa and certain Caribbean islands. Due to the potential of heartwater and its vector to pose an economic and health threats to non-endemic regions, they have been designated as high-consequence foreign animal diseases and pests by the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Understanding the ecology and biology of A. variegatum is critical for developing effective control methods to limit its spread to other geographic regions. A key step in this process is the isolation of tick organs and further elucidation of their functions (i.e. vector competence). However, the literature contains limited documentation of the complete internal structure of Amblyomma tick species. In this study, we describe the internal structure of unfed nymphs, partially engorged males, and unfed and partially engorged females of the tick species A. variegatum. The objective is to facilitate the identification and the localization organs of interest while highlighting the morphological differences between the tropical bont tick and other tick species. This foundational work will support the development of various applications following the isolation of tick organs. These findings not only deepen our understanding of Amblyomma variegatum anatomy but also provide a critical foundation for tackling the broader challenges of tick-borne diseases and advancing vector control strategies in both endemic and non-endemic regions.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Machine learning (ML) models offer the potential to address this by leveraging clinical data to enhance diagnostic precision. We utilized clinical data, including antibody titers and viral load measurements collected at the time of hospital admission, to predict the likelihood of acute COVID-19 progressing to long COVID. Our machine learning models achieved median AUROC values ranging from 0.64 to 0.66 and AUPRC values between 0.51 and 0.54, demonstrating their predictive capabilities. Feature importance analysis revealed that low antibody titers and high viral loads at hospital admission were the strongest predictors of long COVID outcomes. Comorbidities, including chronic respiratory, cardiac, and neurologic diseases, as well as female sex, were also identified as significant risk factors for long COVID. Our findings suggest that ML models have the potential to identify patients at risk for developing long COVID based on baseline clinical characteristics.

AsDMS catalyzes the class II cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form drimenyl diphosphate, which then undergoes enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis to yield drimenol, a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol with antifungal and anticancer properties. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of AsDMS and its complex with a sesquiterpene thiol, which are the first of a terpene cyclase-phosphatase. The AsDMS structure exhibits a two-domain architecture consisting of a terpene cyclase {beta} domain and a haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like phosphatase domain, with two distinct active sites located on opposite sides of the protein. Mechanistic studies show that dephosphorylation of the drimenyl diphosphate intermediate proceeds through stepwise hydrolysis, such that two equivalents of inorganic phosphate rather than inorganic pyrophosphate are co-products of the reaction sequence. When the AsDMS reaction is performed in H218O, 18O is not incorporated into drimenol, indicating that the hydroxyl oxygen of drimenol originates from the prenyl oxygen of FPP rather than bulk water. These results correct a mechanistic proposal previously advanced by another group. Surprisingly, AsDMS exhibits unprecedented substrate promiscuity, catalyzing the conversion of substrate mimic farnesyl-S-thiolodiphosphate into cyclic and linear sesquiterpene products. Structural and mechanistic insights gained from AsDMS expand the functional diversity of terpene biosynthetic enzymes and provide a foundation for engineering ""designer cyclases"" capable of generating new terpenoid products.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequent molecular event in this malignancy. p53 inactivation occurs either through TP53 mutations in HPV-negative cases or via HPV-mediated p53 degradation in HPV-positive (HPV+) cases, where most retain a wild-type (WT) TP53 allele. This underscores the critical role of p53-regulated processes in HNSCC pathogenesis. Clinically, HPV+ HNSCC is associated with significantly better outcomes than HPV-negative cases. Despite HPV E6-mediated degradation of p53, 10% of HPV+ HNSCC cases have mutant TP53 alleles, suggesting an additional need to suppress p53 signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV+ TP53-WT HNSCC cells have residual p53 activity, with tumor-suppressive effects. Specifically, ablation of p53 in HPV+ TP53-WT HNSCC cells lead to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion. RNA-sequencing revealed that p53 regulates gene transcription (both activation and repression) in the presence of HPV, and we confirmed that these functions are p53-specific. Human tumor data further reveal that among HPV+ HNSCC cases, those with WT TP53 have significantly better survival outcomes than HPV+ cases with TP53 mutations. Notably, HPV+ TP53-WT HNSCC tumors show decreased PI3K-AKT signaling, increased gene methylation in oncogenic pathways, and fewer chromosomal alterations compared to HPV+ TP53-mutant tumors. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that p53 is entirely inactivated in HPV+ HNSCC and provide critical insights into HNSCC-specific, p53-driven tumor suppression mechanisms with implications for targeted therapies in HNSCC.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of Bostrychia moritziana, a species that is classified into the Rhodomelaceae family of the Ceramiales order, both of which constitute the largest and most diverse family and order of red algae, respectively. Contrary to the commonly held view that red algae generally have small genomes, we report significant genome size expansion in Bostrychia and other Ceramiales species, which we posit as one of at least three independent genome expansion events that occurred during red algal evolution. Our analyses suggest that these expansions do not involve polyploidy or ancient whole genome duplications, but in the case of Bostrychia appear to be largely driven by the dramatic proliferation of a single lineage of giant Plavaka DNA transposons. Consistent with increased genome size, we identify a substantial increase in gene content in Bostrychia that was shaped both by de novo gene emergence and by the amplification of gene families in common with other Ceramiales seaweeds, providing key insight into the genetic adaptations underpinning the evolutionary success of this species-rich order. Finally, our sex-specific assemblies enabled us to resolve the UV sex chromosomes in Bostrychia, which feature expanded gene-rich sex-linked regions.

How these clusters interact with genes and their impact on transcriptional activity remain heavily debated. Here we take advantage of the naturally occurring increase in transcriptional activity during Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos to characterize the functional roles of RNAPII clusters in a developmental context. Using single-molecule tracking and lattice light-sheet microscopy, we find that RNAPII cluster formation depends on transcription initiation and that cluster lifetimes are reduced upon transcription elongation. We show that single clusters are stably associated with active gene loci during transcription and that cluster intensities are strongly correlated with transcriptional output. Our data suggest that prior to ZGA, RNAPII clusters prime genes for activation, whereas after ZGA, clusters are composed mostly of elongating molecules at individual genes.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Owing to its high through-put and gentle, volumetric imaging nature, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an attractive modality to image such samples. However, the orthogonal dual-objective geometry of LSFM makes sample mounting challenging. Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) circumvents these issues by achieving light-sheet imaging through a single objective near the sample, with a further two objectives acting to image a tilted, oblique plane in the specimen. However, at low magnification, as required for mesoscopic imaging, conventional OPM systems suffer from a complicated and inefficient light path and/or a limited numerical aperture. Here we present a simple method for mesoscopic OPM that enables efficient light collection at any numerical aperture. By placing the camera directly in the remote space, the oblique plane can be imaged without the need for a third microscope system. Using a commercially available camera with 1.4 {micro}m pixels, we demonstrate imaging over a 5.3 x 3 x 2.6 mm3 field of view with a lateral resolution of [~]2 {micro}m and axial resolution of [~]22 {micro}m.

We report that double strand breaks (DSB) induce de novo formation of chromatin loops, with the break positioned at the loop base. These loops form only in S/G2 phases and occur during repair via homologous recombination (HR), concomitant with DNA end resection and RAD51 assembly. RAD51 showed two-tiered accumulation around DSBs, with a broad (~Mb) domain arising from the homology search. This domain is regulated by cohesin unloader, is constrained by TAD boundaries, and it overlaps with chromatin regions reeled through the break-anchored loop, suggesting that loop extrusion regulates the homology search. Indeed, depletion of NIPBL results in reduced HR, and this effect is more pronounced when the HR donor is far (~100 kb) from the break. Our data indicates that loop-extruding cohesin promotes the mammalian homology search by facilitating break-chromatin interactions within the damaged TAD.

Advances in long-read sequencing have allowed highly accurate TE detection, though at a higher cost than short-read sequencing. Recent studies using long reads have shown that existing short-read TE detection methods perform inadequately when applied to real data. In this study, we use a machine learning approach (called TEforest) to discover and genotype TE insertions and deletions with short-read data by using TEs detected from long-read genome assemblies as training data. Our method first uses a highly sensitive algorithm to discover potential TE insertion or deletion sites in the genome, extracting relevant features from short-read alignments. To discriminate between true and false TE insertions, we train a random forest model with a labeled ground-truth dataset for which we have calculated the same set of short-read features. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark of TEforest and traditional TE detection methods using real data, finding that TEforest identifies more true positives and fewer false positives across datasets with different read lengths and coverages, while also accurately inferring genotypes and the precise breakpoints of insertions.

By learning short-read signatures of TEs previously only discoverable using long reads, our approach bridges the gap between large-scale population genetic studies and the accuracy of long-read assemblies. This work provides a user-friendly tool to study the prevalence and phenotypic effects of TE insertions across the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

While many network models have been proposed to describe connectome communication, current approaches assume that every pair of neural elements communicates according to the same principle. Connectomes, however, are heterogeneous networks, comprising elements with varied topological and neurobiological makeups. In this paper, we investigate how connectome architecture may facilitate different signalling regimes depending on the topological embedding of communicating neural elements. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the modular structure of brain networks fosters a dual mode of communication balancing diffusion--passive signal broadcasting--and routing--selective transmission via efficient paths. To this end, we introduce the relative diffusion score (RDS), a measure to quantify the proportional capacity for network communication via diffusion versus routing. We examined the interplay between RDS and connectome architecture in 6 organisms spanning a wide range of spatial resolutions and connectivity mapping techniques--from the complete nervous system of the larval fly to the inter-areal human connectome. Our analyses establish multiple lines of evidence suggesting that connectomes may be universally organised to support within-module diffusion and between-module routing. Using a series of rewiring null models, we untangle the contributions of connectome topology and geometry to the relationship between routing, diffusion and modular architecture. In conclusion, our work puts forth a hybrid conceptualisation of neural communication, in which diffusion contributes to functional segregation by concentrating information within localised clusters, while specialised signal routes enable fast, long-range and cross-system functional integration.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

The replication and segregation of elements integrated into the host chromosome are ensured by the host life cycle. In contrast, the persistence of autonomously replicating elements relies on their ability to remain within the host population. Here, we assess the evolutionary success of different persistence strategies of prokaryotic plasmids. Through intracellular competitions between plasmid genotypes, we find that combining active partitioning during cell division with a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system for post-segregational killing is more effective than either strategy alone. Mathematical modeling of long-term plasmid evolution, calibrated with empirical plasmid persistence probabilities, further supports these findings. A survey of enterobacterial genomes indicates that partitioning and TA systems are core features of large conjugative plasmids. Indeed, we confirm the presence of a previously unrecognized type I TA system in IncX3 plasmids, which serve as important vectors of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. These findings suggest that large conjugative plasmids likely encode TA systems, including those yet to be identified. The combination of TA and partitioning systems emerges as the most effective strategy for the persistence of low-copy extrachromosomal elements with unstable segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

This challenge has become more pressing with advances in neural recording technology, such as high-density Neuropixels for large-scale neural recording or flexible electrodes for long-term stable recording over months to years. The volume and complexity of these datasets make manual curation infeasible, requiring an automated and scalable solution. Here, we introduce SpikeAgent, a multimodal large language model (LLM)-based AI agent that automates and standardizes the entire spike sorting pipeline.

It generates interpretable reports, providing transparent justifications for each sorting decision, enhancing transparency and reliability. We benchmarked SpikeAgent against human experts across various neural recording technology, demonstrating its versatility and ability to achieve curation consistency that are equal to, or even higher than human experts. It also drastically reduces the expertise barrier and accelerates the curation and validation time by orders of magnitude. Moreover, it enables automated interpretability of the neural spiking data, which cannot be achieved by any conventional methods.

While the well-studied zebrafish posterior lateral line has emerged as a powerful model to study collective cell migration, far less is known about development of the anterior lateral line, which produces the supraorbital and infraorbital lines around the eye, as well as mandibular and opercular lines over the jaw and cheek. Here we show that normal development of the zebrafish anterior lateral line system from cranial placodes is dependent on another vertebrate-specific cell type, the cranial neural crest. We find that cranial neural crest and anterior lateral lines develop in close proximity, with absence of neural crest cells leading to major disruptions in the overlying anterior lateral line system. Specifically, in the absence of neural crest neither supraorbital nor infraorbital lateral lines fully extend, such that the most anterior cranial regions remain devoid of neuromasts, while supernumerary ectopic neuromasts form in the posterior supraorbital region. Both neural crest and cranial placodes contribute neurons to the lateral line ganglia that innervate the neuromasts and in the absence of neural crest these ganglia, as well as the lateral line afferent nerves, are disrupted. Finally, we establish that as ontogeny proceeds, the most anterior supraorbital neuromasts come to lie within neural crest-derived frontal and nasal bones in the developing cranium. These are the same anterior supraorbital neuromasts that are absent or mislocated in specimens lacking neural crest cells. Together, our results establish that cranial neural crest and cranial placode derivatives function in concert over the course of ontogeny to build the complex cranial lateral line system.

Previous studies have shown that many IC neurons exhibit receptive fields for individual features of auditory stimuli, such as sound frequency, intensity, and location, but growing evidence suggests that some IC neurons may multiplex features of sound. Here, we used in vivo juxtacellular recordings in awake, head-fixed mice to examine how IC neurons responded to frequency-modulated sweeps that varied in speed, direction, intensity, and frequency range. We then applied machine learning methods to determine how individual IC neurons encode features of FM sweeps. We found that individual IC neurons multiplex FM sweep features using various strategies including spike timing, distribution of inter-spike intervals, and first spike latency. In addition, we found that decoding accuracy for sweep direction can vary with sweep speed and frequency range, suggesting the presence of mixed selectivity in single neurons. Accordingly, using static receptive fields for direction alone yielded poor predictions of neuron responses to vocalizations that contain simple frequency changes. Lastly, we showed that encoding strategies varied across individual neurons, resulting in a highly informative population response for FM sweep features. Together, our results suggest that multiplexing sound features is a common mechanism used by IC neurons to represent complex sounds.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235

Here, we present STABLES, a novel gene fusion strategy that links a gene of interest (GOI) to an essential endogenous gene (EG), with a ""leaky"" stop codon in between. This ensures both selective pressure against deleterious mutations and high expression of the GOI. By leveraging a machine learning (ML) framework, we predict optimal GOI-EG pairs based on bioinformatic and biophysical features, identify linkers likely to minimize protein misfolding, and optimize DNA sequences for stability and expression. Experimental validation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated significant improvements in stability and productivity for fluorescent proteins and human proinsulin. The results highlight a scalable, adaptable and organism-agnostic method to enhance the evolutionary stability of engineered strains, with broad implications for industrial biotechnology and synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1739657261235
