However, the complexity of the structural features that determine PPIs makes their design challenging. We present BindCraft, an open-source and automated pipeline for de novo protein binder design with experimental success rates of 10-100%. BindCraft leverages the trained deep learning weights of AlphaFold2 to generate nanomolar binders without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins, and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9. We showcase their functional and therapeutic potential by demonstrating that designed binders can reduce IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples. This work represents a significant advancement towards a ""one design-one binder"" approach in computational design, with immense potential in therapeutics, diagnostics, and biotechnology.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

These advancements allow us to systematically screen through 200 million human protein pairs and predict 18,316 PPIs with an expected precision of 90%, among which 5,578 are novel predictions. 3D models of these predicted PPIs nearly triple the number of human PPIs with accurate structural information, providing numerous insights into protein function and mechanisms of human diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Longer-lived mammals tend to gain fewer noisy CpGs with age, irrespective of whether these originate from hyper- or hypomethylation processes. Importantly, we found that the rate of epigenetic entropy gain declines in a linear fashion with species maximum lifespan, pointing to the existence of a universal limit for mammalian lifespan in the vicinity of 220 years.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Computer vision algorithms use depth maps to encode distances in three-dimensional scenes but it is unknown whether such depth maps are generated by animal visual systems. To answer this question, we focused on motion parallax, a depth cue relying on visual motion resulting from movement of the observer. As neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are broadly modulated by locomotion, we hypothesized that they may integrate vision- and locomotion-related signals to estimate depth from motion parallax. Using recordings in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment, we found that conjunctive coding of visual and self-motion speeds gave rise to depth-selective neuronal responses. Depth-selective neurons could be characterized by three-dimensional receptive fields, responding to specific virtual depths and retinotopic locations. Neurons tuned to a broad range of virtual depths were found across all sampled retinotopic locations, showing that motion parallax generates a depth map of visual space in V1.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Some bacterial and archaeal proteins include selenocysteine or pyrrolysine, the 21st and 22nd amino acids, but no evidence establishes the adoption of a genetic code in which a stop codon universally encodes either amino acid. Here, we used proteomics to confirm the prediction that certain Archaea consistently incorporate pyrrolysine at TAG codons, supporting a new archaeal genetic code which we designate Genetic Code 34. This genetic code has 62 sense codons encoding 21 amino acids, and only two stop codons. In contrast with monophyletic genetic code distributions in bacteria, Code 34 occurs sporadically. This, combined with evidence for lateral gene transfer of the code change machinery and anticipated barriers to code reversal, suggests Code 34 arose independently in multiple lineages. TAG codon distribution patterns in Code 34 genomes imply a wide range in time since code switch. We identified many new enzymes containing Pyl residues, raising questions about potential roles of this amino acid in protein structure and function. We used five new PylRS/tRNAPyl pairs from Code 34 archaea to introduce new-to-nature pyrrolysine analogs into proteins in E. coli, demonstrating their utility for genetic code expansion.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Our previous work has detailed the timeline of BBB functional maturation in zebrafish, revealing a conserved mechanism of BBB induction through the suppression of endothelial transcytosis. Yet, as opposed to extensive research on glial-vascular interactions in rodents, such interactions remain largely overlooked in the zebrafish model system. Here, we focus on glial-vascular development in the zebrafish brain, leveraging three glial gene promoters: gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), glast (an astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter), and glastini (a new, shortened, equally effective version of the Glast promoter). Using these glial promoters, sparse labeling revealed fewer glial-vascular interactions during early larval stages, with both glial coverage and contact area increasing as the zebrafish brain matured. We then generated stable transgenic lines for both the Glast and Glastini promoters and observed similar increases in glial coverage during larval development, starting at ~30% coverage at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and peaking at ~60% at 10 dpf. Ultrastructural assessment of glial-vascular interactions using electron microscopy (EM) confirmed a progressive increase in glial coverage over larval development, with maximal coverage reaching ~70% in adult zebrafish, significantly lower than the nearly 100% coverage observed in mammals. Finally, immunogold-EM labeling confirmed that cells identified as glia in aforementioned morphological analyses were indeed Glast-positive. Taken together, our results identify the temporal profile of glial-vascular maturation in the zebrafish brain.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Our results show that reduced PAM specificity causes persistent non-selective DNA binding and recurrent failures to engage the target sequence through stable guide RNA hybridization, leading to reduced genome editing efficiency in cells. These findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between broad PAM recognition and genome editing effectiveness. We propose that high-efficiency RNA-guided genome editing relies on an optimized two-step target capture process, where selective but low-affinity PAM binding precedes rapid DNA unwinding. This model provides a foundation for engineering more effective CRISPR-Cas and related RNA-guided genome editors.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations. Results: We used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020-2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 114 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 76 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1727907060924

CPK28 regulates immune homeostasis, stress responses, and growth in multiple angiosperms including tomato, rice, cotton, and Arabidopsis thaliana (hereafter, Arabidopsis). In Arabidopsis, CPK28 phosphorylates and activates the E3 ubiquitin ligases PLANT U-BOX 25 (PUB25) and PUB26 that target the major immune signaling protein BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), resulting in its turnover. The CPK28-PUB25/26-BIK1 regulatory module maintains precise levels of BIK1 in the cell and is thought to optimize immune responses. Separated from angiosperms by 450M years of evolution, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (hereafter, Marchantia) has emerged as a model system to study the evolution of signaling modules across land plants. Here, we demonstrate that the function of CPK28 is conserved in Marchantia. MpCPK28 displays Ca2+-dependent protein kinase activity and is inhibited by calmodulin in vitro. Over-expression of MpCPK28 results in pronounced developmental phenotypes and decreased chitin-induced oxidative burst, and MpCPK28 can functionally complement the mutant phenotypes of the Arabidopsis cpk28-1 mutant. MpCPK28 associates with and phosphorylates multiple residues on Marchantia AVRPPHB SUSCEPTIBLE 1 (PBS1)-like (PBL)-a (MpPBLa), a functional ortholog of AtBIK1, as well as MpPUB20e (a putative ortholog of AtPUB25/26). MpPBLa undergoes proteasomal degradation in Marchantia and can be polyubiquitinated by MpPUB20e. The occurrence of the CPK28-PUB25/26-BIK1 module across land plants reveals that the regulation of immune amplitude has been conserved throughout plant evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

We created a probabilistic atlas of brainstem arousal nuclei built on diffusion MRI scans of five ex vivo human brain specimens scanned at 750 micron isotropic resolution. Labels of arousal nuclei used to generate the probabilistic atlas were manually annotated with reference to nucleus-specific immunostaining in two of the five brain specimens. We then developed a Bayesian segmentation algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic atlas as a generative model and automatically identifies brainstem arousal nuclei in a resolution- and contrast-agnostic manner. The segmentation method displayed high accuracy in both healthy and lesioned in vivo T1 MRI scans and high test-retest reliability across both T1 and T2 MRI contrasts.

In addition to the well-established role of transcriptional and translational programs, there is increasing evidence that post-translational mechanisms contribute to the rapid adaptation of the mitochondrial proteome to hypoxia. Here, we have used a proteomic survey to define how the m-AAA protease AFG3L2, a proteolytic complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane, regulates mitochondrial proteostasis. Our experiments identify a broad spectrum of mitochondrial substrate proteins and show that AFG3L2 is activated in hypoxia along an HIF1alpha-mTORC1 signaling axis. AFG3L2-mediated proteolysis restricts mitochondrial biogenesis and gene expression by degrading proteins, which are involved in mitochondrial protein import, mitochondrial transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA modification and stability, and RNA granule formation. Our experiments highlight the important contribution of proteolytic rewiring of the mitochondrial proteome for the adaptation to low oxygen tension and shed new light on the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative disorders associated with mutations in AFG3L2.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Despite being observed for the first time twenty years ago, their structure and how they are assembled remains unknown. Here, we reconstituted in vitro the ESCRT-0 clathrin assembly onto various types of membranes. The ESCRT-0 protein HRS, a known clathrin adaptor on endosomes, was found to form protein condensates. These condensates spread into a thin layer on PI(3)P-rich membranes. Platinum replica electron microscopy revealed that, surprisingly, the assembly of clathrin was different depending on the HRS phase. Protein droplets recruited clathrin as a dense, curved lattice, with many cage-like structures. On two-dimensional condensates, HRS recruited clathrin as a dense flat assembly. Two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted the clustering of cholesterol in the underlying membrane, while cholesterol enhanced PI(3)P- dependent HRS recruitment on the membrane. On free-standing membranes, two-dimensional HRS-clathrin condensates promoted membrane flattening. Overall, these results show that a two- dimensional HRS condensate creates a unique membrane structure for sorting cargo molecules, defining a new mechanism in membrane trafficking processes.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

We utilise a systematic chimaera approach to define the differential functionality of two closely related Medicago truncatula SCAR proteins in plant development. We show that SCAR/WAVE contribution to Medicago truncatula root hair or Arabidopsis thaliana trichome formation is dependent on two central intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).

Intersectional vulnerabilities among individuals with SCD in the United States (US) raise historically and socially contingent questions about tubal sterilization in individuals with SCD. However immediate postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) rates among individuals with SCD in the US are unknown. Objective: To compare rates of TS in deliveries to people with SCD and without SCD, and to determine the modifying effect of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) on the odds of TS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated cross-sectional study used the 2012-2019 National Inpatient Sample to estimate the rate of TS among delivery hospitalizations to people with SCD, without SCD (non-SCD), Black people with and without SCD, and people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of TS between SCD and non-SCD deliveries, SCD and non-SCD deliveries with Black race, and SCD and CF deliveries. We examined whether SMM modified the association between TS and SCD in interaction analyses. Exposure: SCD, CF Results: Among 29,822,518 deliveries, 6.7% underwent TS. Among 18,860 SCD deliveries, 8.8% underwent TS. Among 2,945 CF deliveries, 6.6% underwent TS. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, SCD had higher odds of TS compared to non-SCD deliveries (aOR= 1.38 [1.06,1.79]) and in a stratified analysis of deliveries coded with Black race (aOR= 1.42 [1.06,1.90]). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, there was no difference in the odds of TS between SCD or CF deliveries (aOR=1.0 [0.51,2.24]). SMM more than doubled the odds of TS in SCD deliveries (interaction: aOR=2.34 [1.57,3.47]; aOR= 2.14 [1.40,3.24] in deliveries coded with Black race). Conclusion: Even after accounting for patient and hospital characteristics, people with SCD have higher odds of immediate postpartum TS compared to control groups. SMM at delivery increased the odds of TS in SCD compared to all non-SCD deliveries and compared to CF deliveries. Possibly SMM severity, patient preference, or clinician recommendations inform this finding. SMM is 3-7 times more common in SCD than non-SCD pregnancies and may be a modifiable risk factor for TS in SCD deliveries.","NA","medrxiv",1727907060924

However, they are threatened by climate change and even face the risk of local or global extinction. The responses of these species to climate change have received little attention. In this study, we examine the effects of climate change on state flowers and insects in the United States by employing correlative species distribution models (SDMs). We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential habitats for each species under both historical and future climate scenarios, and how these changes might influence the distributions of state flower and insect species. Our results show that more than half of the state flowers ([~] 66%) and insects ([~] 51%) are predicted to experience a substantial decrease in regions with favorable climates within the states they represent. Conversely, only a small number (Flowers: [~] 2%; Insects: [~] 10%) are projected to see an increase in habitat suitability in the future. Certain states may no longer possess suitable habitats for their state-designated species. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage might be at risk due to reduced habitat suitability and local extinctions driven by climate change. These findings can provide guidance regarding the protection or replacement of state species to preserve cultural heritage.

Significance StatementWe have known for decades that climate change may lead to species local or global extinction. However, the vast majority of such research has focused on species of ecological or economic importance. Only recently have researchers begun to seriously consider the impacts of climate change on our cultural heritage, and that research has mainly focused on tangible cultural assests such as buildings and anthropological sites. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on species of cultural significance, namely U.S. state flowers and insects. We find that the majority of these species are threatened with local extinction from climate change, and the loss of these species will take with them important aspects of our history and culture.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Here we designed libraries composed of extant, ancestral, mutagenized or miniaturized variants of Pol III promoters or guide RNA (gRNA) scaffolds and quantified their ability to mediate precise edits to the mammalian genome via multiplex prime editing. We identified thousands of parts that reproducibly drive a range of editing activities in human and mouse stem cells and cancer cell lines, including hundreds exhibiting similar or greater activity than the sequences used in conventional genome engineering constructs. We further conducted saturation mutagenesis screens of canonical Pol III promoters (U6p, 7SKp, H1p) and the prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) scaffold, which identified tolerated variants that can be superimposed on baseline parts to further enhance sequence diversity. While characterizing thousands of orthologous promoters from hundreds of extant or ancestral genomes, we incidentally mapped the functional landscape of mammalian Pol III promoter evolution. Finally, to showcase the usefulness of these parts, we designed a ten key molecular recording array that lacks repetitive subsequences in order to facilitate its one-step assembly in yeast. Upon delivering this 15.8 kb tandem array of promoters and guides to mammalian cells, individual pegRNAs exhibited balanced activities as predicted by the activity of component parts, despite their relocation to a single locus. Looking forward, we anticipate that the diversified parts and variant effect maps reported here can be leveraged for the design, assembly and deployment of synthetic loci encoding arrays of gRNAs exhibiting predictable, differentiated levels of activity, which will be useful for multiplex perturbation, advanced biological recorders and complex genetic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying leukocyte and tumor cell extravasation remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed an imaging pipeline that integrates fast, label-free live-cell imaging with deep learning-based image analysis to quantitatively track and compare the initial steps of extravasation--cell landing and arrest on an endothelial monolayer--under physiological flow conditions. We find that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells exhibit variable adhesion strength and flow sensitivity. Remarkably, some PDAC cells demonstrate comparable endothelial engagement as leukocytes, preferentially arresting at endothelial junctions, potentially due to increased stiffness at these sites, which leads to exposure to the underlying basal extracellular matrix. PDAC cells also tend to cluster in regions with high, heterogeneous expression of the endothelial CD44 receptor. Simulations suggest that clustering results from the combination of CD44-mediated attachment and localized flow disturbances that facilitate subsequent cell attachment. Targeting CD44 using siRNA or function-blocking antibodies, or degrading its ligand hyaluronic acid (HA) almost completely abolishes PDAC cell attachment. Overall, we demonstrate that cancer and immune cells share both common and unique features in endothelial adhesion under flow, and identify CD44 and HA as key mediators of PDAC cell arrest.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Using high-throughput chemical synthesis to diversify a ligand for the transcriptional coactivator ENL with 3,163 structurally diverse chemical building blocks, we discovered a compound dHTC1 that elicits potent, selective, and stereochemistry-dependent degradation of ENL by induced binding to CRL4CRBN.

Studies using animal models have shown that binge eating animals consume food in quantities that surpass physiological necessity, and that the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior overlap with those involved in habit formation. Habitual behaviors are thought to be automatic responses acquired through extended behavioral training and are dependent on the context in which they were learned. Therefore, this study hypothesized that binge eating has a context-dependent component. We investigated whether the excessive palatable sugar intake observed in an animal model of binge eating is triggered by an associated context as a learned behavior. To test this, mice were trained to develop binge-like sugar consumption in a specific context. During the test phase, we reduced the hedonic needs for sugar solution by providing a two-hour satiety period. Sugar solution was then presented in both the training context and a novel context. The results showed that in the training context, the mice continued to consume sugar solution at levels similar to those observed at the onset of the satiation. In contrast, this context-induced sugar consumption was not observed in the novel context. These findings suggest that, like habitual behaviors, binge eating is induced under in the context-dependent manner and insensitive to the consequence of the behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

These biosensors can be deployed in engineered cells to study or treat disease. Although the central mediators of hypoxia responsiveness have been characterized, the dynamics of this response are generally less understood, and there is no general approach to modulate hypoxia biosensors to tune their performance to meet application-specific needs. To address the need for high-performing hypoxia biosensors, we investigated strategies to enhance biosensor performance by identifying minimal promoter choices and positive feedback circuits that both achieved low background and amplified hypoxia-induced gene expression. To generate insight into the mechanisms by which feedback drives differential performance, we developed an explanatory mathematical model. Our analysis suggests a previously unreported dual regulatory mechanism that was necessary to explain the full set of experimental observations and that provides new insights into regulatory dynamics in chronic hypoxia. This study exemplifies the potential of using synthetic gene circuits to perturb natural systems in a manner that uniquely enables the elucidation of novel facets of natural regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Herein, we demonstrate a significant change in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) dependent entry by primary SARS-CoV-2 isolates that occurred upon arrival of Omicron lineages. Mechanistically we show this shift to be a function of two distinct ACE2 pools based on TMPRS22 association with the ACE2 Collectrin-Like Domain (CLD). In engineered cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, ACE2/TMPRSS2 complexes led to either augmentation or attenuation of viral infectivity of pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages, respectively. Mutagenesis of the ACE2-CLD TMPRSS2 cleavage site in ACE2 restored infectivity across all Omicron lineages through enabling ACE2 binding that facilitated TMPRSS2 activation of viral fusion. Our data supports the evolution of Omicron lineages towards the use of ACE2 unable to form complexes with TMPRSS2 and consistent with ACE2 structure and function as a chaperone for many tissue specific amino acid transport proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

During learning, layer 2/3 somatosensory neurons enhanced their response to reward-predictive stimuli, explainable as gain amplification from apical dendrites. Reward-prediction errors were reduced and confidence in the outcome prediction increased. Upon rule reversal, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, through disinhibitory VIP interneurons, encoded a context-prediction error, signaling a loss of confidence.

Disease control relies on prevention (water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions or vaccination) and effective antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) Typhi lineages have emerged and become established in many parts of the world. Knowledge of local pathogen populations informed by genomic surveillance, including of lineages (defined by the GenoTyphi scheme) and AMR determinants, is increasingly used to inform local treatment guidelines and to inform vaccination strategy. Current tools for genotyping Typhi require multiple read alignment or assembly steps and have not been validated for analysis of data generated with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing devices. Here, we introduce Typhi Mykrobe, a command line software tool for rapid genotyping of Typhi lineages, AMR determinants, and plasmid replicons direct from sequencing reads. Results We validated Typhi Mykrobe lineage genotyping by comparison with the current standard read mapping-based approach and demonstrated 99.8% concordance across nearly 13,000 genomes sequenced with Illumina platforms. For the few isolates with discordant calls, we show that Typhi Mykrobe results are better supported by the evidence from raw sequence read data than the results generated using the mapping-based approach. We also demonstrate 99.9% concordance for detection of AMR determinants compared with the current standard assembly-based approach, with similar results for plasmid marker detection. Typhi Mykrobe predicts clinical resistance categorisation (S/I/R) for eight drug classes, and we show strong agreement with phenotypic categorisations generated from reference laboratory minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for n=1,572 Illumina-sequenced isolates (>99% agreement within one doubling dilution). Using n=100 isolates sequenced with both Illumina and ONT, we show strong concordance (>96% for genotype and >98% for AMR and plasmid) between calls made from ONT reads and those made from Illumina reads. Typhi Mykrobe takes less than a minute per sample and is available at https://github.com/typhoidgenomics/genotyphi. Conclusions Typhi Mykrobe provides rapid and sensitive genotyping of Typhi genomes direct from Illumina and ONT reads. It demonstrated accurate assignment of GenoTyphi lineage, detection of AMR determinants and prediction of corresponding AMR phenotypes, and identification of plasmid replicons.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Stabilization of the WNT effector {beta}-catenin promotes expression of mesoderm-specifying genes such as Brachyury (Bra/T, encoded by TBXT) and Eomesodermin and drives an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that occurs at 49-52 hrs post WNT activation. Interestingly, WNT activation also triggers an early contraction of stem cell colonies, with increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, resulting to cellular morphological changes. Small molecule inhibitors and genetic approaches were applied to determine if contractility is related to mesoderm differentiation. Contrary to expectation, suppressing contractility accelerated differentiation; Bra/T induction was enhanced, and EMT initiated as early as 24 hrs post WNT activation. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Rho kinase or myosin light chain kinase, to increase contractility, efficiently blocked any induction of mesoderm, including EMT. Mechanistically, reduced contractility promoted active {beta}-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus. We propose that the early contraction of human pluripotent stem cell colonies in response to WNT activation initially delays mesoderm induction by restraining accumulation of active {beta}-catenin, suggesting a role for contractility as a temporal gate.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

We measured COVID-19 VE against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection in HCWs in the country of Georgia from January - June 2022, during a period of Omicron circulation.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of HCWs in six hospitals in Georgia. HCWs were enrolled in early 2021. Participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires. Symptomatic HCWs were tested by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen test (RAT). Participants were also routinely tested, at varying frequencies during the study period, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RAT, regardless of symptoms. Serology was collected quarterly throughout the study and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We estimated absolute and relative VE of a first booster dose compared to a primary vaccine series as (1-hazard ratio)*100 using Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsAmong 1253 HCWs, 141 (11%) received a primary vaccine series (PVS) and a first booster, 855 (68%) received PVS only, and 248 (20%) were unvaccinated. Most boosters were BNT162b2 (Comirnaty original monovalent) vaccine (90%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm) (9%). Most PVS were BNT162b2 vaccine (68%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (24%). Absolute VE for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56 - 77) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104 - 42) at 30 - 59 days, and - 46% (95% CI -156 - 17) at [&ge;] 60 days. Relative VE of first booster dose compared to PVS was 58% (95% CI 1 - 82) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, 21% (95% CI -33 - 54) at 30 - 59 days, and -9% (95% CI -82 - 34) at [&ge;] 60 days.

ConclusionIn Georgia, first booster dose VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was moderately effective but waned very quickly during Omicron. Increased efforts to vaccinate priority groups in Georgia, such as healthcare workers, prior to periods of anticipated high COVID-19 incidence are essential.","NA","medrxiv",1727907060924

Recently, the Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) method was performed with the G4-specific BG4 antibody to target Tn5 transposase to G4s. While this method generated a novel high-resolution map of G4s, we unexpectedly observed a strong correlation between the genome-wide signal distribution of BG4 CUT&Tag and accessible chromatin. To examine whether untargeted Tn5 cutting at accessible chromatin contributes to BG4 CUT&Tag signal, we examined the genome-wide distribution of signal from untargeted (i.e. negative control) CUT&Tag datasets. We observed that untargeted CUT&Tag signal distribution was highly similar to both that of accessible chromatin and of BG4 CUT&Tag. We also observed that BG4 CUT&Tag signal increased at mapped G4s, but this increase was accompanied by a concomitant increase in untargeted CUT&Tag at the same loci. Consequently, enrichment of BG4 CUT&Tag over untargeted CUT&Tag was not increased at mapped G4s. These results imply that either the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions contain mappable G4s or that the presence of G4s within accessible chromatin cannot reliably be determined using BG4 CUT&Tag alone.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

We report a case of a novel, idiosyncratic gesture in a Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus) at  La Foret des Singes, Rocamadour, France. One adult male, Jomanix, was observed hand-clapping. To our knowledge, hand-clapping has never been described before in this species. To hand-clap, the male briefly shifted his weight onto his legs, lifted his upper body, and clapped both hands together. We recorded 30 instances of hand-clapping. Twenty-five of these hand-claps occurred in combination with other agonistic signals, such as lunges and open mouth threats. Recipients either responded with counter-aggression (N = 9) or a submissive response (N = 16). In five of the 30 events, the context was unclear. These observations suggest that the gesture constitutes an agonistic signal. According to the staff at  La Foret des Singes, the hand-clapping may have been copied from staff members who occasionally hand-clap to shoo the animals away from areas where they were not supposed to be, but that notion remains speculative. In the meantime, another subject from the same group reportedly started to hand-clap, but the subject had passed away before we could document the behaviour. The observations show that Jomanix can flexibly combine a novel gesture with other established communicative signals. The hand-clap is goal-directed and fulfils the criteria for first-order intentional communication. This case, as well as anecdotal reports from a Tonkean macaque (Macaca tonkeana) hand-clapping to get attention, reveals greater flexibility in the gestural communication of this genus than previously assumed but also underscores that social learning of the production of communicative gestures occurs rarely in this taxon.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in Pst, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve Pst races or isolates, a Puccinia striiformis isolate, and one Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed the presence of known effector motifs such as [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Clear annotations based on sequence and structure included superoxide dismutase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase. A common feature observed was the formation of similar structures from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune function. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between Pst effectors and effectors from other pathogens such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting convergent evolutionary strategies. This comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into Pst effectors structural and functional characterization, advancing our understanding of Pst pathogenicity and evolution.

Author SummaryStripe rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a major threat to wheat crops worldwide. The fungus uses special proteins, called effectors, to bypass the plants immune defenses and establish infection. To better understand how these effectors work, we used a computational tool, AlphaFold2, to predict the structures of over 15,000 Pst effector proteins. Interestingly, some of the effectors resemble proteins found in other plant pathogens, suggesting that different fungi may evolve similar ways to infect plants. Our research offers new insights into the infection strategies of Pst and could lead to new methods for protecting wheat from stripe rust.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Individuals learn category labels using a variety of strategies to ensure that sensory signals, such as sounds or images, can be assigned to proper categories. Categories are often learned on the basis of extreme examples, and the boundary between categories can differ among individuals. The trajectories for learning also differ among individuals, as different individuals rely on different strategies, such as repeating or alternating choices. However, little is understood about the relationship between individual learning trajectories and learned categorization. To study this relationship, we trained mice to categorize auditory stimuli into two categories using a two-alternative forced choice task. Because the mice took several weeks to learn the task, we were able to quantify the time course of individual strategies and how they relate to how mice categorize stimuli around the categorization boundary. Different mice exhibited different trajectories in learning the task. Mice displayed preferences for a specific category, manifested by a choice bias in their responses, but this bias drifted with learning. We found that this drift in choice bias correlated with variability in the category boundary for sounds with ambiguous category membership. Next, we asked how stimulus-independent, individual-specific strategies informed learning. We found that the tendency to repeat choices, which is a form of perseveration, contributed to long-term learning. These results indicate that long-term trends in individual strategies during category learning affect learned category boundaries.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Our prior studies highlight the importance of glutamate as a key regulator of ILC tumor growth and therapeutic response. Here we examine the expression of four key proteins involved in glutamate transport and metabolism (SLC3A2, SLC7A11, GPX4, and GLUD1/2) in a racially diverse cohort of 72 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) ILC and 50 ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type (IDC/NST) patients with primary disease. All four proteins are associated with increased tumor size in ILC, but not IDC/NST, with SLC3A2 also specifically linked to shorter overall survival and the presence of comorbidities in ILC. Notably, GLUD1/2 expression is associated with ER expression in ILC, and is most strongly associated with increased tumor size and stage in Black women with ILC from our cohort and TCGA. We further explore the effects of GLUD1 inhibition in endocrine therapy-resistant ILC cells using the small-molecule inhibitor R162, which reduces ER protein levels, increases reactive oxygen species, and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. These findings highlight a potentially important role for glutamate metabolism in ILC, particularly for Black women, and position several of these glutamate-handling proteins as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ILC.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

While traditionally viewed as a mutagenic selfish element, recent studies point to roles for LINE1 in early mouse development, T cell quiescence and neurogenesis. Here we show that human LINE1 RNA is essential for self-renewal and identity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Silencing of LINE1 using either antisense oligonucleotides or CRISPR interference in naive hESCs leads to a strong induction of 8C-like cells (8CLCs). We found that genes derepressed upon LINE1 KD are not uniformly distributed across the genome, with an enrichment for chromosome 19, which includes key markers of the 8C state such as TPRX1. Silencing of TPRX1, but not other putative 8C regulators p53 or H3.XY, suppresses the induction of the 8C program in LINE1 KD hESCs. We found that LINE1 RNA is preferentially localized to the lamina and periphery of the nucleolus in hESCs. Sequencing of Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs) and Nucleolus-Associated Domains (NADs) reveals a preferential association of chromosome 19 with NADs in hESCs. However, 8CLCs have a distinct nucleolar morphology and a lower association of chromosome 19 and TPRX1 loci with the nucleolus relative to naive and primed hESCs, suggesting a role for nucleolar dynamics in the 8CLC-hESC transition. In agreement, LINE1 KD leads to disruption of nucleolar architecture with signs of nucleolar stress. Independent perturbations of the nucleolus induce the 8C program in hESCs. Genes induced by LINE1 KD are enriched for targets of Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2), and inhibition of PRC2 leads to a strong induction of 8C genes. Our results indicate that LINE1 coordinates nuclear compartmentalization and chromatin-mediated gene repression to prevent developmental reversion of hESCs.

Plasticity of excitatory projection neurons has been considered to be the primary neuronal substrate for the acquisition and storage of memories. However, a wide range of inhibitory interneurons controls the activity of projection neurons in a spatially and temporally precise manner, yet their contribution to memory acquisition, storage and expression remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a miniature microscope imaging approach to monitor the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction at the single cell level. We find that amygdala interneurons display mixed-selectivity and show complex plastic responses at both the ensemble and single neuron level across the acquisition, expression and extinction of aversive memories. In contrast to bidirectional single cell plasticity across distinct fear states, learning-induced changes at the population level occur transiently during conditioning and do not consolidate across days. Examining molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells are predominantly activated by high fear states. In contrast, somatostatin (SST) interneurons display a preference for safety cues and thereby suppress excitatory neuron responsiveness. However, responses of individual neurons within the SST and VIP populations are non-uniform, indicating the presence of functional subtypes within classical molecularly-defined interneuron populations. Taken together, we identify complex neuronal plasticity within amygdala interneuron ensembles that goes beyond a passive processing function, suggesting a critical role of inhibitory microcircuit elements for memory selectivity and stability.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Although the EPd has been previously implicated in epilepsy and olfactory processing, its anatomical organization, connectivity patterns, and function remain largely unclear due to a lack of specific molecular markers. Our previous mapping study serendipitously identified that the Oxt receptor (Oxtr) is densely expressed in the EPd. Subsequent immunohistochemical and spatial transcriptomic analyses confirmed that Oxtr expression is enriched in the EPd, revealing distinct molecular organization compared to the neighboring claustrum. Whole brain input-output mapping of EPd Oxtr-positive neurons unveils extensive bidirectional connections to the ventral half of the brain, orchestrating functional circuits regulating olfaction, internal state, and emotion. Furthermore, our in-vivo miniscope recordings show that EPd Oxtr neurons exhibit high baseline activity during exploratory behavior, with a sharp decrease in activity in response to novel stimuli. This suggests that the EPd regulates interoceptive states and likely plays a role in adapting to novel exteroceptive cues.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

To counteract metal-based host defense strategies (e.g., nutritional immunity, metal poisoning), S. aureus uses a combination of metal-sensing transcription factors and regulatory RNAs to maintain metal homeostasis. In this study, we uncovered an unprecedented interaction between a cis- and a trans-acting regulatory RNA controlling a conditionally essential gene, mntY, encoding a Mn efflux pump. This broadly conserved RNA-RNA interaction between a Fe-responsive sRNA and a Mn-sensing riboswitch allows the integration of Fe- and Mn-related stresses, notably encountered at the infection site, to fine-tune mntY expression. Remarkably, deletion of the mntY gene is strongly pleomorphic, causing growth defects, altering virulence factor expression, immune evasion, and survival during infection. We demonstrated that MntY is critical for the adaptation of S. aureus to both low and high Mn environments, due to its dual role in metalation of Mn-dependent exoenzymes and Mn detoxification. These findings point to MntY as a promising new therapeutic target to combat multidrug-resistant staphylococcal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060924

Circulating levels of the chemokine CXCL10 are strongly positively associated with poor outcome; however, its precise role in pathogenesis and its suitability as a therapeutic target have remained undefined. Here, we challenged 4-6 month old C57BL/6 mice genetically deficient in Cxcl10 with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2. Infected male, but not female, Cxcl10-/- mice displayed increased mortality compared to wild type controls. Histopathological damage, inflammatory gene induction and virus load in the lungs of male mice 4 days post infection and before death were not broadly influenced by Cxcl10 deficiency. However, accumulation of B cells and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma of infected mice was reduced in the absence of Cxcl10. Thus, during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, Cxcl10 regulates lymphocyte infiltration in the lung and confers protection against mortality.

However, in vivo environments are geometrically, mechanically, and chemically complex, and it has been difficult to understand how each of these parameters contribute to the propulsive strategy utilized by cells in these diverse settings. To address this, we employed a sacrificial micromolding approach to generate polymer substrates with tunable stiffness, controlled adhesivity, and user-defined microscale geometries. We combined this together with live-cell imaging and three-dimensional traction force microscopy (TFM) to quantify the forces that cells use to transit through constricting channels. Surprisingly, we observe that cells migrating through compliant constrictions take longer to transit and experience greater nuclear deformation than those migrating through more rigid constrictions. TFM reveals that this deformation is generated by inwardly directed contractile forces that decrease the size of the opening and pull the walls closed around the nucleus. These findings show that nuclear deformation during confined migration can be accomplished by internal cytoskeletal machinery rather than by reactive forces from the substrate, and our approach provides a mechanism to test between different models for how cells translocate their nucleus through narrow constrictions. The methods, analysis, and results presented here will be useful to understand how cells choose between propulsive strategies in different physical environments.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

This process helps individuals establish what they themselves, as opposed to others, control and what consequence they themselves cause or that another person causes. People identify when active disambiguation is needed and engage in it at that time. A pattern of activity in the supramarginal gyrus that emerges during and after active disambiguation is linked to establishing controllability and tracking the outcomes from which control is inferred. Activity in this brain region also signals a second learning mechanism, by which individuals attribute outcomes to themselves versus others, in proportion to their perceived control.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

By its nature, this text is flexible and inconsistent, making it challenging to use for clinical trial matching, decision support, and predictive modeling. In this study, we develop and assess text normalization pipelines built using large-language models. Materials and Methods: Here, we evaluated four LLM-based normalization strategies: Zero-Shot Recall, Prompt Recall, Semantic Search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and one baseline, TF-IDF based String Matching. We compared normalization performance across two datasets of condition terms mapped to SNOMED, one tailored to oncology, and one covering a wide range of medical conditions. Additionally, we benchmarked our models against the TAC 2017 drug label annotations, which normalizes terms to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms. Results: RAG, which effectively combines Prompt Recall and Semantic Search, was the most effective, accurately identifying the correct term 88.31% of the time for the domain-specific dataset and 79.97% for the broader dataset. Our model achieved a micro F1 score of 88.01 on task 4 of the TAC2017 conference, surpassing all other models without relying on the provided training data. Discussion: These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in medical text normalization. We find that retrieval-focused approaches overcome traditional LLM limitations for this task. Conclusion: Large language models combined with retrieval-augmented generation should be explored for text normalization of biomedical free text.","NA","medrxiv",1727907060925

As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a layered multiphase liquid-like structure and the site of ribosome biogenesis. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps that ultimately result in formation of the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU). However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered nucleolar organization is poorly understood due to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here, we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. Furthermore, by generating synthetic de novo nucleoli through an engineered rDNA plasmid system in cells, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

The main crossover pathway relies on ZMM proteins, including ZIP4 and HEI10, and is typically resolved by the MLH1/MLH3 heterodimer, MutL{gamma}. Our analysis of plant fertility and bivalent formation revealed that the MUS81 endonuclease can partially compensate for the MutL{gamma} loss. Comparing genome-wide crossover maps of the mlh1 mutant with ZMM-deficient mutants and lines with varying HEI10 levels reveals that while crossover interference persists in mlh1, it is weakened. Additionally, mlh1 show reduced crossover assurance, leading to a higher incidence of aneuploidy in offspring. This is likely due to MUS81 resolving intermediates without the crossover bias seen in MutL{gamma}. Comparing mlh1 mlh3 mus81 and zip4 mus81 mutants suggests that additional crossover pathways emerge in the absence of both MutL{gamma} and MUS81. The loss of MutL{gamma} can also be suppressed by eliminating the FANCM helicase. Elevated expression of MLH1 or MLH3 increases crossover frequency, while their overexpression significantly reduces crossover numbers and plant fertility, highlighting the importance for tight control of MLH1/MLH3 levels. By contrast, PMS1, a component of the MutL endonuclease, appears not to be involved in crossing-over. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique role of MutL{gamma} in ZMM-dependent crossover regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Gram-negatives encode a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that delivers toxins into eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Previous studies highlighted the importance of Salmonella T6SSs in bacterial antagonism and host cell infection, but few antibacterial effectors have been described. Here, we used bioinformatic strategies to identify the T6SS effectors in 10,000 Salmonella genomes. As a result, we identified and manually curated 128 candidates. Specific Salmonella serovars harbor unique effectors that are target-specific (antibacterial or anti-eukaryotic), depending on the T6SS subtype (e.g. i1 or i3). In addition, 45 previously uncharacterized toxin domains were identified and designated STox (Salmonella toxins). STox15 was among the most frequent candidates and was selected for in-depth characterization. STox15 is an antibacterial effector belonging to the NlpC/P60 papain-like fold superfamily with a permuted catalytic core typical of lipid-targeting versions rather than peptidases or amidases. Biochemical analysis with recombinant protein and lipidomics of intoxicated Escherichia coli revealed that STox15 displays phospholipase activity cleaving off acyl groups from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. This work improves our understanding of the Salmonella T6SS effector repertoire and provides the first direct characterization of a lipid-targeting NlpC/P60 domain in biological conflicts.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

To interrogate this risk, we developed a two-color flow cytometry-based system (Flo-LOH), detecting LOH in ~5% of cells following a DSB. After this initial increase, cells with LOH decrease due to a competitive disadvantage with parental cells, but if isolated, they stably propagate. Segmental loss from terminal deletions with de novo telomere addition and nonreciprocal translocations is observed as well as whole chromosome loss, especially following a centromeric DSB. LOH spans megabases distal from the DSB, but also frequently tens of megabases centromere-proximal. Inhibition of microhomology-mediated end joining massively increases LOH, which is synergistically increased with concomitant inhibition of canonical nonhomologous end joining. The capacity for large-scale LOH must therefore be considered when using DSB-based gene editing, especially in conjunction with end joining inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

While epigenetic aging clocks have shown accuracy in predicting biological age, they typically provide single estimates for the samples and lack mechanistic insights. In this study, we challenge the paradigm that aging can be sufficiently described with a single biological age estimate. We describe Ageome, a computational framework for measuring the epigenetic age of thousands of molecular pathways simultaneously in mice and humans. Ageome is based on the premise that an organisms overall biological age can be approximated by the collective ages of its functional modules, which may age at different rates and have different biological ages. We show that, unlike conventional clocks, Ageome provides a high-dimensional representation of biological aging across cellular functions, enabling comprehensive assessment of aging dynamics within an individual, in a population, and across species. Application of Ageome to longevity intervention models revealed distinct patterns of pathway-specific age deceleration. Notably, cell reprogramming, while rejuvenating cells, also accelerated aging of some functional modules. When applied to human cohorts, Ageome demonstrated heterogeneity in predictive power for mortality risk, and some modules showed better performance in predicting the onset of age-related diseases, especially cancer, compared to existing clocks. Together, the Ageome framework offers a comprehensive and interpretable approach for assessing aging, providing insights into mechanisms and targets for intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Here, we studied the association between MHC-variant binding and risk of clonal haematopoiesis (CH), a pre-cancer state in the blood driven by expansions of mutant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We predicted MHC binding affinity towards 40 known CH hotspot variants in 380,000 UK Biobank participants, and examined the relationship between predicted binding to each variant and risk of its expansion in the blood. Despite being well powered to detect subtle differences in selective pressure, we did not find associations between predicted MHC binding and CH prevalence for any of the hotspot variants. In individuals in whom we identified CH, there was no relationship between predicted binding affinity to the variant and size of the clone. Overall, we do not find evidence for the MHC genotype to be a factor that affects which somatic variants expand in CH, suggesting a limited role for immunosurveillance in shaping the genetic diversity of the blood.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

A common procedure that allows such physical interfacing is cranial microsurgery, wherein small to large craniotomies are performed in the overlying skull for insertion of neural interfaces or implantation of optically clear windows for long-term cranial observation. Performing craniotomies is, however, a skilled task that requires significant time and practice and further needs to be carried out precisely to ensure that the procedure does not cause damage to the underlying brain and dura. Here, we present a computer vision-guided craniotomy robot (CV-Craniobot) that utilizes machine learning to accurately estimate the dorsal skull anatomy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Instantaneous information of the skull morphology is used by a robotic mill to rapidly and precisely remove the skull from a desired craniotomy location. We show that the CV-Craniobot can perform small (2 - 4 mm diameter) craniotomies with near 100% success rates within 2 minutes and large craniotomies encompassing most of the dorsal cortex in less than 5 minutes.

Although some inaccuracies in the length of homopolymer stretches were observed, the remaining sequences were obtained without significant errors. This method could potentially reduce the labor and costs associated with cloning, primer synthesis, and sequence assembly, thus making it a viable option for the analysis of long PCR fragment sequences.

Symptoms usually manifest in the first year of life and include prolonged severe seizures, developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. DS patients have an increased mortality rate, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Approximately 90% of patients carry a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium ion channel, NaV1.1. The NaV1.1 channel is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. Previous studies have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which specifically downregulates SCN1A gene expression. This natural antisense transcript (NAT) can be modulated by AntagoNATs, small synthetic oligonucleotides developed to inhibit NAT function. In a DS mouse model, AntagoNATs were shown to modulate Scn1a expression by targeting the Scn1a NAT, improving seizure frequency after repeated administration. Here, we have developed novel AntagoNATs and incorporated these into a clinically relevant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy vector, to test in a DS mouse model (Scn1a+/-) and provide a one-off treatment approach. Eighteen AntagoNATs were tested in vitro; from the best performing candidates, we selected two AntagoNAT sequences (K & H) for in vivo testing as they had the highest homology (90%) to human SCN1A NAT. We administered both vectors to newborn Scn1a+/- mice via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) injection to target the brain and heart. AAV9-AntagoNAT-H significantly increased survival, decreased febrile seizures and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency compared to the PBS control group. When administered at P14 by ICV and IV injection, AAV9-AntagoNAT-H increased survival. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated for the first time the delivery of AntagoNAT technology via an AAV9 vector and thus offering the possibility of a one-time treatment for DS patients.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Two essential technologies underpin this achievement: the ability to clone entire genomes in host organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the successful transplant of these genomes into recipient cells to generate living organisms. In all previous work the recipient cell in genome transplantation experiments has been Mycoplasma capricolum. In this study, we explored the potential of using Mycoplasma mycoides strains as recipient cells for genome transplantation. By increasing polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration from 5% to 10%, we successfully transplanted various M. mycoides strains using several M. mycoides recipient cells. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability to transplant M. capricolum genomes into M. mycoides recipient cells; although with lower efficiency compared to M. mycoides strains. These findings provide a modified transplantation protocol and likely get us closer to expanding genome transplantation to other bacterial species.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that parafoveal orthographic neighbours (e.g., ""writer"" vs. ""waiter"") showed higher representational similarity than non-neighbours (e.g., ""writer"" vs. ""police""), emerging ~68 ms after fixation onset on the preceding word (e.g., ""clever"") in the visual word form area. Similarly, parafoveal semantic neighbours (e.g., ""writer"" vs. ""author"") exhibited increased representational similarity at ~137 ms in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Importantly, the degree of orthographic and semantic parafoveal processing predicted individual reading speed. Our findings suggest fast hierarchical processing of parafoveal words across distinct brain regions, which enhances reading efficiency.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

However, our understanding of how sequence variation impacts the functional activity of RDs is limited. To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet (Transcriptional Effector Network) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs. Our work highlights critical considerations for future dataset design and model training strategies to improve functional variant prioritization and precision design of synthetic regulatory proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Bloom concluded that the data deletion had obfuscated the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that deletion may have been requested to comply with a government order; further, he questioned reported sample collection dates on and after January 30, 2020.

However, the molecular determinants and functional impact of this additional system of inheritance are poorly characterized. Through comprehensive analyses of severe DNA methylation loss over TEs in an experimental population and in >700 natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, we uncovered hundreds of TE epivariants in nature, most of which can be inherited independently of DNA sequence changes and thus are true epialleles. Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Recombination rates are widely observed to negatively associate with the abundance of transposable elements (TEs), selfish genetic elements that move between genomic locations. While such associations are usually interpreted as recombination influencing the efficacy of selection at removing TEs, accumulating findings suggest that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked a novel approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches-analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing mobilome can actively modify recombination landscapes, shaping genome evolution within and between species.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Mitigation of arboviral outbreaks relies largely on the use of insecticides, but the effectiveness of such responses is threatened by the evolution of insecticide resistance. Monitoring mosquito susceptibility to different insecticides is therefore vital for informed decisions regarding outbreak responses. In this study, we elucidate the patterns of resistance to two insecticide classes within the primary vectors of West Nile virus in the northeast and midwestern regions of the continental United States, Culex pipiens and Culex restuans.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEgg collections were performed throughout Illinois from 2018-2020, and adults were tested for insecticide resistance to permethrin and malathion. Individuals from each sampling location were sequenced to determine the presence of kdr target-site mutations, and biochemical assays were performed to determine increases in detoxification enzymes and insensitive acetylcholinesterase. Results from the bottle assays indicate variable resistance rates in Illinois, however lowered mortality was found in most of the regions that were tested. The kdr mutation (L1014F) was present in 50% of Culex pipiens sequenced, and more prevalent in southern Illinois compared with northern and central (p < 0.001). Different mechanisms were predictive of resistance by species and insecticide, with permethrin resistance being affected by kdr-allele frequency and oxidase levels and malathion resistance by - and {beta}-esterases in Cx. pipiens. For Cx. restuans -esterase and oxidase levels were predictive of permethrin resistance while {beta}-esterase and insensitive acetylcholinesterase levels were predictive of malathion resistance.

Conclusions/SignificanceWe documented variation in insecticide resistance levels that appear to be driven by population differences in kdr mutation rates and metabolic resistance mechanisms. The presence of different mechanisms in species and regions has implications for approaches to resistance management and highlights the need to implement and maintain insecticide resistance monitoring practices.

Author SummaryMosquitoes are the vectors of many major diseases including malaria, dengue, yellow fever, zika, and West Nile virus. Insecticides are often used to control mosquitoes and the outbreaks they cause. However, evidence has shown that populations of different mosquito species worldwide have developed resistance to our most common insecticides. This study shows that West Nile virus vectors in Illinois, (Culex pipiens and Culex restuans) are no exception to this trend. Egg collections were made throughout the state during the 2018-2020 field seasons and the resulting adults were tested for resistance to two common insecticides using the CDCs bottle bioassay protocol. The results indicate that rates of resistance vary throughout the state and population differences in resistance mechanisms are driving this variation.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein-protein interaction interfaces, we find 87% are predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further, FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.

Significance StatementPeptides can regulate protein interactions by binding to specific interfaces, and fragments of larger proteins have high potential to function in this manner. Recently developed experimental methods allow massively parallel measurement of protein fragment-based inhibition in vivo. However, we have lacked comparable computational methods to predict which protein fragments act as inhibitors and how they bind. Here we report a new approach, FragFold, which leverages high-throughput AlphaFold predictions of protein - fragment binding to tackle these problems at scale. FragFold is successful at predicting inhibitory protein fragments and their binding modes across diverse protein structures and functions. This new approach stands to enable proteome-wide discovery of inhibitory protein fragments and aid the interpretation of high-throughput experimental measurements of inhibitory activity.

However, the efficacy of editing outcomes is subject to various factors, with template format playing a crucial role. Currently, the predominant non-viral template format for inducing homology-directed repair (HDR) after nuclease-induced DNA breaks is double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is toxic when transfected at high doses. Previous studies have demonstrated that using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with flanking double-stranded Cas-target-sequences (CTS) as a repair template for Cas9-mediated gene editing can mitigate this toxicity and increase knock-in efficiency. Here, we investigate CTS design for AsCas12a Ultra by exploring PAM orientation and binding requirements of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Additionally, we rule out in vitro ssDNase activity of AsCas12a Ultra under cell-physiological Mg2+ conditions. Finally, we showcase the advantage of using ssDNA with double-stranded CTS end modifications (ssCTS) at high doses for delivering clinically relevant transgenes of varying sizes into three T-cell receptor-CD3 complex genes (TRAC, CD3{zeta}, CD3{varepsilon}), achieving up to 90% knock-in rates for a 0.8kb insert at the CD3{varepsilon} locus. Overall, AsCas12a Ultra and ssCTS donors represent a platform for highly efficient knock-in in primary human T cells with minimal toxicity.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis.

Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727907060925

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

To explore it, we analyzed deep proteomic and transcriptomic data from over 1,000 human samples, including 6 cancer types and 26 healthy human tissues. This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in proteins derived from 1,990 genes. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abundance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. The substitution ratios are positively associated with intrinsically disordered regions and genetic polymorphisms in gnomAD, though the polymorphisms cannot account for the substitutions. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse.

While many viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) causing acute or chronic infections (such as herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1), the lack of a clear mechanistic link between viruses and protein aggregation into amyloids, a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, has rendered such a connection elusive. Recently, we showed that viruses can induce aggregation of purified amyloidogenic proteins via the direct physicochemical mechanism of heterogenous nucleation (HEN). In the current study, we show that the incubation of HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leads to the amyloid aggregation of several proteins known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as: APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1), ApoE, clusterin, 2-macroglobulin, PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), ceruloplasmin, nucleolin, 14-3-3, transthyretin and vitronectin. Importantly, UV-inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect its ability to induce amyloid aggregation, as amyloid formation is dependent on viral surface catalysis via HEN and not its ability to replicate. Additionally, viral amyloid induction led to a dramatic drop in the soluble protein concentration in the CSF. Our results show that viruses can physically induce amyloid aggregation of proteins in human CSF and result in soluble protein depletion, and thus providing a potential mechanism that may account for the association between persistent and latent/reactivating brain infections and neurodegenerative diseases.

Significance StatementViruses have generally been excluded from the etiology of amyloid pathologies based on the assumption that amyloid formation requires a proteinaceous conformational template (a prion) to form. Here we show that neuroinvasive viruses induce amyloid aggregation of a plethora of proteins in human CSF even after UV inactivation. Our work illustrates that viruses can induce amyloid aggregation of endogenous human proteins in their native environment by acting as physical catalysts of amyloid nucleation and phase transition. Demonstrating this direct mechanistic link, which is independent of templating, can help better understand the link between viruses and neurodegenerative disorders, especially in the post-COVID-19 era.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states.

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Active modifications to the spatial environment could thus be a potent tool to mitigate epidemic risk. We tested whether Lasius niger ants modify their nest architecture in response to pathogens by introducing controlor pathogen-treated individuals into nest-digging groups, and monitoring three-dimensional nest morphogenesis over time. Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality. Simulations confirmed that these changes reduced disease spread. These results provide evidence for architectural immunity in a social animal and offer insights into how spatial organisation can be leveraged to decrease epidemic susceptibility.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Here, we introduce the largest collection of ancient Portuguese genomic datasets (n = 68) to date, spanning 5,000 years, from the Neolithic to the 19th century.

ResultsWe found evidence of patrilocality in Neolithic Portugal, with admixture from local hunter-gatherers and Anatolian farmers, and persistence of Upper Paleolithic Magdalenian ancestry. This genetic profile persists into the Chalcolithic, reflecting diverse local hunter- gatherer contributions. During the Bronze Age, local genetic ancestry persisted, particularly in southern Iberia, despite influences from the North Pontic Steppe and early Mediterranean contacts. The Roman period highlights Idanha-a-Velha as a hub of migration and interaction, with a notably diverse genetic profile. The Early Medieval period is marked by Central European ancestry linked to Suebi/Visigoth migrations, adding to coeval local, African, and Mediterranean influences. The Islamic and Christian Conquest periods show strong genetic continuity in northern Portugal and significant African admixture in the south, with persistent Jewish and Islamic ancestries suggesting enduring influences in the post-Islamic period.

ConclusionsThis study represents the first attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of Portugal from the analysis of ancient individuals. We reveal dynamic patterns of migration and cultural exchange across millennia, but also the persistence of local ancestries. Our findings integrate genetic information with historical and archaeological data, enhancing our understanding of Iberias ancient heritage.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

This degeneracy impacts the efficiency of heterologous protein production due to the codon usage preferences of each organism. The process of tailoring organism-specific synonymous codons, known as codon optimization, must respect local sequence patterns that go beyond global codon preferences. As a result, the search space faces a combinatorial explosion that makes exhaustive exploration impossible. Nevertheless, throughout the diverse life on Earth, natural selection has already optimized the sequences, thereby providing a rich source of data allowing machine learning algorithms to explore the underlying rules. Here, we introduce CodonTransformer, a multispecies deep learning model trained on over 1 million DNA-protein pairs from 164 organisms spanning all kingdoms of life. The model demonstrates context-awareness thanks to the attention mechanism and bidirectionality of the Transformers we used, and to a novel sequence representation that combines organism, amino acid, and codon encodings. CodonTransformer generates host-specific DNA sequences with natural-like codon distribution profiles and with negative cis-regulatory elements. This work introduces a novel strategy of Shared Token Representation and Encoding with Aligned Multi-masking (STREAM) and provides a state-of-the-art codon optimization framework with a customizable open-access model and a user-friendly interface.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Such defenses include venoms that deter predators by targeting nociceptive (pain-sensing) pathways. Through co-evolution, venom toxins can become extremely efficient modulators of their molecular targets. The venom of velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is notoriously painful. The intensity of a velvet ant sting has been described as ""Explosive and long lasting, you sound insane as you scream. Hot oil from the deep fryer spilling over your entire hand."" [1] The effectiveness of the velvet ant sting as a deterrent against potential predators has been shown across vertebrate orders, including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds [2-4]. The venoms low toxicity suggests it has a targeted effect on nociceptive sensory mechanisms [5]. This leads to the hypothesis that velvet ant venom targets a conserved nociception mechanism, which we sought to uncover using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Drosophila larvae have peripheral sensory neurons that sense potentially damaging (noxious) stimuli such as high temperature, harsh mechanical touch, and noxious chemicals [6-9]. These polymodal nociceptors are called class IV multidendritic dendritic arborizing (cIV da) neurons, and they share many features with vertebrate nociceptors, including conserved sensory receptor channels [10,11]. We found that velvet ant venom strongly activated Drosophila nociceptors through heteromeric Pickpocket/Balboa (Ppk/Bba) ion channels. Furthermore, we found a single venom peptide (Do6a) that activated larval nociceptors at nanomolar concentrations through Ppk/Bba. Drosophila Ppk/Bba is homologous to mammalian Acid Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) [12]. However, the Do6a peptide did not produce behavioral signs of nociception in mice, which was instead triggered by other non-specific, less potent, peptides within the venom. This suggests that Do6a is an insect-specific venom component that potently activates insect nociceptors. Consistent with this, we showed that the velvet ants defensive sting produced aversive behavior in a predatory praying mantis. Together, our results indicate that velvet ant venom evolved to target nociceptive systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, but through different molecular mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

Not only is it important to understand how coordinated changes in circuit parameters alter neural activity, but also when dynamics are unaffected by--or invariant to--such changes. Computational modeling has revealed invariances in single neurons and small circuits that are thought to reflect their robustness against variability and perturbations. However, generalizing these insights to larger circuits in cortex and other brain areas remains challenging. A key bottleneck lies in inverse modeling of neural circuits with spiking network models, i.e., identifying parameter configurations that quantitatively match dynamics observed in neural recordings. Here, we present Automated Model Inference from Neural Dynamics (AutoMIND) for efficient discovery of invariant circuit model configurations. AutoMIND leverages a mechanistic model with adaptive spiking neurons and clustered connectivity, which displays a rich variety of spatiotemporal dynamics. Probabilistic deep generative models--trained on network simulations only--then returns many parameter configurations consistent with a given target observation of neural activity. Applied to several datasets, AutoMIND discovers circuit models of synchronous network bursting in human brain organoids across early development, as well as models capturing complex frequency profiles of Neuropixels recordings in mouse hippocampus and cortex. In each case, we obtain hundreds of configurations that compose a (nonlinear) parameter subspace in which population dynamics remain unchanged. Surprisingly, global and local geometries of the invariant subspace are not fixed, but differ for different dynamics. Together, our results shed light on dynamic-dependent invariances of circuit parameters underlying diverse population dynamics, while demonstrating the flexibility of AutoMIND for inverse modeling of neural circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

This process is orchestrated by selective autophagy receptors (SARs) that direct specific cargo for degradation. While significant strides have been made in understanding the molecular framework of selective autophagy, the diversity of SAR repertoires across species remain largely unexplored. Through a comparative interactome analysis across five model organisms, we identified a suite of conserved and lineage-specific SAR candidates. Among these, we validated CESAR as a conserved SAR critical for proteostasis under heat stress. CESAR specifically facilitates the degradation of hydrophobic, ubiquitinated protein aggregates and is indispensable for heat stress tolerance. Our study offers a rich resource for SAR discovery and positions CESAR as a pivotal regulator of proteostasis, with broad implications for improving stress resilience in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

This technology allows researchers to sequence longer DNA fragments in a single read, providing more comprehensive genomic information compared to previous methods. Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined. In this study, we introduced several improvements to nanopore sequencing, including nanopore local chemistry sequencing, novel motor and pore proteins, chip design, and basecalling algorithms. Our new nanopore sequencing platform, CycloneSEQ, demonstrated long-duration sequencing (107 hours) on a single chip with high yield (>50 Gb). In human genomic DNA sequencing, CycloneSEQ was able to produce long reads with N50 33.6 kb and modal identity 97.0%.

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages:  Opimoda+ and  Diphoda+. Compellingly, this position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing  typical excavates are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the  excavate cell architecture trace back to LECA.

TEs are epigenetically silenced to prevent harmful effects caused by either global activation leading to genome instability or insertional mutation disturbing gene transcription. However, whether the activation of a single element can contribute to pathological phenotypes without directly affecting gene expression is largely unknown. Here, we show that tissue-specific expression of a TE in the embryo leads to the production of viral-like particles (VLPs) which can affect organ formation. Failure to silence an LTR retrotransposon inserted upstream of the Fgf8 gene results in its co-expression with Fgf8 in the developing embryo. While local gene regulation is unaffected, the LTR retrotransposon participates in chromatin folding at the locus and adopts the expression of the regulatory domain it is located in. This drives the production of VLPs in the Fgf8-expressing cells of the developing limb, triggering apoptotic cell death at the time of digit outgrowth and resulting in a limb malformation resembling human ectrodactyly. This phenotype can be rescued by knock-out or knock-in of the retrotransposon causing mutations preventing its full retroviral cycle. Insertion of the same element at other developmental loci faithfully recapitulates expression according to the neighboring regulatory activity. Our findings provide a mechanism by which TE insertion is incorporated into the local genomic regulatory landscape and show how VLP production in post-implantation embryos can interfere with organ formation.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925

Successfully adapting to a new environment with different access to food, shelter, and other resources requires rapid physiological and behavioural changes, which could potentially be facilitated by gut microbiota plasticity. To investigate whether alterations in gut microbiota support this transition to a feral lifestyle, we analysed the gut microbiomes of domestic and feral cats from six geographically diverse locations using genome-resolved metagenomics. By reconstructing 229 draft genomes from 92 cats, we identified a typical carnivore microbiome structure, with notable diversity and taxonomic differences across regions. While overall diversity metrics did not differ significantly between domestic and feral cats, hierarchical modelling of species communities, accounting for geographic and sex covariates, revealed distinct taxonomic and functional profiles between the two groups. While taxonomic enrichment was balanced, microbial functional capacities were significantly enriched in feral cats. These functional enhancements, particularly in amino acid and lipid degradation, correspond to feral cats dietary reliance on crude protein and fat. Additionally, functional differences were consistent with behavioural contrasts, such as the more aggressive and elusive behaviour measured in feral cats compared to the docile behaviour of domestic cats. Finally, the observed enrichment in short-chain fatty acid, neurotransmitter, and vitamin B12 production in feral cats aligns with improved cognitive function and potentially contributes to their heightened aggression and elusiveness. Our findings suggest that microbiome shifts may play a significant role in the development of physiological and behavioural traits advantageous for a feral lifestyle, supporting the adaptive success of feral cats in the wild.","NA","biorxiv",1727907060925
