We present a protein sequencing method based on the ""reverse translation"" of peptide sequence information into DNA barcodes that document the identity, position, and the originating peptide of each amino acid. We employ a modified Edman degradation process that converts peptides into DNA-barcoded amino acids, which are subsequently detected by proximity extension assay, yielding multi-barcoded DNA outputs that can be PCR amplified and sequenced. Using our method, we sequenced multiple consecutive amino acids within a model peptide. This method also enables the differentiation of single amino acid substitutions, and the identification of post-translational modifications and their positions within multiple peptides simultaneously. With further development, we anticipate that this method will enable highly parallel de novo protein sequencing with single-molecule sensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1717711592226

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

Here, we report chronic neurological dysfunction in mice infected with a virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 that does not infect the brain. Long after recovery from nasal infection, we observed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in olfactory bulb glomeruli and neurotransmitter levels in the substantia nigra (SN) persisted. Vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in these brain areas was accompanied by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and neurobehavioral changes. RNAseq analysis unveiled persistent microglia activation, as found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Early treatment with antivirals (nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir) reduced virus titers and lung inflammation but failed to prevent neurological abnormalities, as observed in patients. Together these results show that chronic deficiencies in neuronal function in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice are not directly linked to ongoing olfactory epithelium dysfunction. Rather, they bear similarity with neurodegenerative disease, the vulnerability of which is exacerbated by chronic inflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Multispectral fluorescent imaging of landmark organelles requires labor-intensive labeling, limits throughput, and compromises cell health. Virtual staining of label-free images with deep neural networks is an emerging solution for this problem. Multiplexed imaging of cellular landmarks from scattered light and subsequent demultiplexing with virtual staining saves the light spectrum for imaging additional molecular reporters, photomanipulation, or other tasks. Published approaches for virtual staining of landmark organelles are fragile in the presence of nuisance variations in imaging, culture conditions, and cell types. This paper reports model training protocols for virtual staining of nuclei and membranes robust to cell types, cell states, and imaging parameters. We developed a flexible and scalable convolutional architecture, named UNeXt2, for supervised training and self-supervised pre-training. The strategies we report here enable robust virtual staining of nuclei and cell membranes in multiple cell types, including neuromasts of zebrafish, across a range of imaging conditions. We assess the models by comparing the intensity, segmentations, and application-specific measurements obtained from virtually stained and experimentally stained nuclei and membranes. The models rescue the missing label, non-uniform expression of labels, and photobleaching. We share three pre-trained models, named VSCyto3D, VSCyto2D, and VSNeuromast, as well as VisCy, a PyTorch-based pipeline for training, inference, and deployment that leverages the modern OME-Zarr format.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (24 May 2024), we have tested 18 retail milk samples from five Canadian provinces (NL, NB, QC, MB, and AB) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early warning system which will enable rapid responses necessary to contain an outbreak should any samples test positive.","NA","medrxiv",1717711592226

Many Gram-negative bacteria that encode PQQ-dependent enzymes do not possess the biosynthetic machinery for its production and instead obtain it from the environment. To achieve this the bacterium Escherichia coli uses the TonB-dependent transporter PqqU as a high-affinity PQQ importer, allowing it to use PQQ at an external concentration as low as 1 nM. Here, we show that PqqU achieves this by binding PQQ with a very high affinity. Using cryo-electron microscopy we determine the structure of the PqqU-PQQ complex at a resolution of 1.99 angstrom, revealing that the extracellular loops of PqqU undergo significant conformational changes upon PQQ binding, which captures the cofactor in an internal cavity. This cavity likely facilitates an airlock-style gating mechanism that prevents non-specific import through PqqU. Using structural modelling we show that the change in PqqU structure upon PQQ binding precludes the binding of bacteriophage, which targets it at a cell surface receptor. Guided by the PqqU-PQQ complex structure we use phenotypic analysis to identify the amino acids essential for PQQ import and leverage this information to map the presence of PqqU across Gram-negative bacteria. This reveals that PqqU is encoded by Gram-negative bacteria from at least 22 phyla from diverse habitats, including those found in aquatic, soil, host-associated, and extreme environments. This indicates that PQQ is a ubiquitous nutrient in many environments, and an important cofactor for bacteria that adopt diverse lifestyles and metabolic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Direct targeting of MYC itself remains an unmet clinical need, therefore focusing on vulnerabilities driven by MYC may be a viable option for novel therapeutic interventions. Using whole-genome CRISPR screening, we identified the de novo pyrimidine synthesis enzyme CTP synthase (CTPS1) as a strong dependency in MYC-driven MB. CTPS1 is the final and rate-limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. Targeted inhibition of CTPS1 leads to decreased tumor cell proliferation and markedly reduces MYC expression in G3 MB models. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that single agent CTPS1 inhibition activates the replication stress signaling pathway mediated by ATM-CHK2 and ATR-CHK1. Blockade of CHK1 kinase activity increases sensitivity to CTPS1 inhibition and significantly impedes heterotopic MB tumor growth. CTPS1 enzymatic activity requires the amino acid glutamine, therefore we inhibited CTPS1 using the glutamine antagonists, JHU083 and JHU395. These compounds are prodrugs of 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) which were developed to exhibit exquisite blood-brain barrier penetrability. Combining JHU083 and CHK1 inhibition demonstrates potent synergy against patient-derived MB xenografts in vivo. Our findings strongly suggest that combining de novo pyrimidine synthesis and ATR-CHK1 inhibitors is a promising treatment for MYC-driven MBs.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

In the validation of the independent test cohort the 3D whole-genome profiling in peripheral blood demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for lymphomas and sarcomas as a class, with accuracy >80%; and high sensitivity and specificity for individual indications, with accuracy >89%. This study demonstrates a 3D genomic approach can be used to develop a non-invasive, blood-based test for multiple choice diagnosis of canine oncological indications. The modular EpiSwitch(R) Specific Canine Blood (EpiSwitch SCB) test promises to help veterinary specialists to diagnose the disease, make more informed treatment decisions, better utilize alternative effective treatments, minimize or avoid unnecessarily toxicity, and efficiently manage costs and resources.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Following uptake, Sec released from SELENOP undergoes metabolisation via selenocysteine lyase (SCLY), producing selenide, a substrate used by selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2), which provides the essential selenium donor - selenophosphate - for the biosynthesis of the selenocysteine tRNA. Here, we report the discovery of an alternative pathway mediating Sec metabolisation that is independent of SCLY and mediated by peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PRDX6 can readily react with selenide and interact with SEPHS2, potentially acting as a selenium delivery system. Moreover, we demonstrate the presence and functional significance of this alternative route in cancer cells where we reveal a notable association between elevated expression of PRDX6 with a highly aggressive neuroblastoma subtype. Altogether, our study sheds light on a previously unrecognized aspect of Sec metabolism and its implications in ferroptosis, offering new avenues for therapeutic exploitation.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Tanning bed radiation is often thought of as a substitute for natural UV radiation despite differences in the maximum doses, UV content, body sites exposed, and patterns of melanoma that arise. Methods: To better understand the epidemiologic trends and etiology of melanoma associated with tanning bed use, we described the patterns of melanoma in patients with quantifiable tanning bed usage and performed exome sequencing of 182 melanocytes from normal skin of a subset of these patients. Results: Tanning bed users were more likely than non-users to have melanoma on body sites with low cumulative levels of sun damage and were more likely to have multiple melanomas. The melanocytes in normal appearing skin from tanning bed users had higher mutation burdens, a higher proportion of melanocytes with pathogenic mutations, and distinct mutational signatures. These differences were most prominent over body sites that experience comparatively less exposure to natural sunlight. Conclusions: We conclude that tanning bed radiation induces melanoma by increasing the mutation burden of melanocytes and by mutagenizing a broader field of melanocytes than are typically exposed to natural sunlight. The unique signatures of mutations in skin cells of tanning users may be attributable to the distinct spectra of radiation emitted from solariums.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Here, we introduce the Visium HD platform (10x Genomics) and use it to investigate human CRC and normal adjacent mucosal tissues from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples. The first assay available on Visium HD is a probe-based spatial transcriptomics workflow that was developed to enable whole transcriptome single cell scale analysis. We demonstrate highly refined unsupervised spatial clustering in Visium HD data that aligns with the hallmarks of colon tissue morphology and is notably improved over earlier Visium assays. Using serial sections from the same FFPE blocks we generate a single cell atlas of our samples, then we integrate the data to comprehensively characterize the immune cell types present in the TME, specifically at the tumor periphery. We observed enrichment of two pro-tumor macrophage subpopulations with differential gene expression profiles that were localized within distinct tumor regions. Further characterization of the T cells present in one of the samples revealed a clonal expansion that we were able to localize in the tissue using in situ gene expression analysis. In situ analysis also allowed us to perform in-depth characterization of the microenvironment of the clonally expanded T cell population and we identified a third macrophage subpopulation with gene expression profiles consistent with an anti-tumor response. Our study provides a comprehensive map of the cellular composition of the CRC TME and identifies phenotypically and spatially distinct immune cell populations within it. We show that the single cell-scale resolution afforded by Visium HD and the whole transcriptome nature of the assay allows investigations into cellular function and interaction at the tumor periphery in FFPE tissues, which has not been previously possible.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Two actionable variants in these genes have reached much higher frequencies than in cosmopolitan UK populations. Here, we report a BRCA2 splice acceptor variant, c.517-2A>G, found in breast and ovarian cancer families from Shetland. We investigated the frequency and origin of this variant in a population-based research cohort of people of Shetland ancestry, VIKING I. The variant segregates with female breast and ovarian cancer in diagnosed cases and is classified as pathogenic. Exome sequence data from 2,108 participants with three or more Shetlandic grandparents in VIKING I was used to estimate the population prevalence of c.517-2A>G in Shetlanders. Nine VIKING I research volunteers carry this variant, on a shared haplotype (carrier frequency 0.4%). This frequency is [~]130-fold higher than in UK Biobank, where the small group of carriers has a different haplotype. Records of birth, marriage and death indicate genealogical linkage of VIKING I carriers to a founder from the Isle of Whalsay, Shetland, similar to our observations for the BRCA1 founder variant from Westray, Orkney. In total, 93.5% of pathogenic BRCA variant carriers in Northern Isles exomes are accounted for by these two drifted variants. We thus provide the scientific evidence of an opportunity for screening people of Orcadian and Shetlandic origins for each drifted pathogenic variant, particularly women with Westray or Whalsay ancestry.","NA","medrxiv",1717711592226

Performing live imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes expressing fluorescent reporters, we found that the myelinic channel system serves microtubule-dependent organelle transport. Further, the intra-myelinic movement of peroxisomes was modulated by neuronal electrical activity in these mixed neural cell cultures. Loss of oligodendroglial Kif21b or CNP in vivo led to apparent stasis of myelin organelles and secondary axon pathology. This suggests that oligodendrocytes require motor transport in the myelinic channel system to maintain axonal integrity.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

We use live observation of wound closure in larval zebrafish after inflicting a stab wound to the brain. We demonstrate that the wound closes in the first 24 hours after injury by global tissue contraction. Microglia accumulation at the point of tissue convergence precedes wound closure and computational modelling of this process indicates that physical traction by microglia could lead to wound closure. Indeed, genetically or pharmacologically depleting microglia leads to defective tissue repair. Live observations indicate centripetal deformation of astrocytic processes contacted by migrating microglia. Severing such contacts leads to retraction of cellular processes, indicating tension. Weakening tension by disrupting the F-Actin stabilising gene lcp1 in microglial cells, leads to failure of wound closure. Therefore, we propose a previously unidentified mechanism of brain repair in which microglia has an essential role in contracting spared tissue.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to study the impact of acid stress on the growth patterns of major reef-building corals. Here, we studied the skeleton forming strategies of four widely distributed coral species in a simulated acidified habitat with a pH of 7.6-7.8. We reconstructed and visualized the skeleton building process, quantified elemental calcium loss, and determined gene expression changes. The results suggest that different reef-building corals have diverse growing strategies in acidified seawater. A unique  cavity-like forming process starts from the inside of the skeletons of Acropora muricata, which sacrifices skeleton density to protect its polyp-canal system. The forming patterns in Pocillopora damicornis, Montipora capricornis, and M. foliosa were characterized by  osteoporosis, exhibiting disordered skeletal structures, insufficient synthesis of adhesion proteins, and low bone mass, correspondingly. In addition, we found that skeletal areas near coral polyps suffered less and had later acidified damage than other skeletal areas in the colony. These results help to understand the skeleton-forming strategies of several major coral species under acid stress, thereby laying a foundation for coral reef protection and restoration under increasing ocean acidification.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

A recent case report identified a rare variant in APOE, APOE3-R136S (Christchurch), proposed to confer resistance to autosomal dominant Alzheimers Disease (AD). However, it remains unclear whether and how this variant exerts its protective effects.

MethodsWe introduced the R136S variant into mouse Apoe (ApoeCh) and investigated its effect on the development of AD-related pathology using the 5xFAD model of amyloidosis and the PS19 model of tauopathy. We used immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis along with single-cell spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to explore the impact of the ApoeCh variant on AD pathological development and the brains response to plaques and tau.

ResultsIn 5xFAD mice, ApoeCh enhances a Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM) phenotype in microglia surrounding plaques, and reduces plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and plasma neurofilament light chain. By contrast, in PS19 mice, ApoeCh suppresses the microglial and astrocytic responses to tau-laden neurons and does not reduce tau accumulation or phosphorylation, but partially rescues tau-induced synaptic and myelin loss. We compared how microglia responses differ between the two mouse models to elucidate the distinct DAM signatures induced by ApoeCh. We identified upregulation of antigen presentation-related genes in the DAM response in a PS19 compared to a 5xFAD background, suggesting a differential response to amyloid versus tau pathology that is modulated by the presence of ApoeCh.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the ability of the ApoeCh variant to modulate microglial responses based on the type of pathology, enhancing DAM reactivity in amyloid models and dampening neuroinflammation to promote protection in tau models. This suggests that the Christchurch variants protective effects likely involve multiple mechanisms, including changes in receptor binding and microglial programming.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

For the applied example, they indicate that the investigated semi-automated method is an appropriate alternative to the manual method.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Whether XyG represents a key nutrient for plant-associated bacteria is unclear. The phylum Bacteroidota are abundant in the plant microbiome and provide several beneficial functions for their host. However, the metabolic and genomic traits underpinning their success remain poorly understood. Here, using proteomics, bacterial genetics, and genomics, we revealed that plant-associated Flavobacterium, a genus within the Bacteroidota, can efficiently utilise XyG through the occurrence of a distinct and conserved gene cluster, referred to as the Xyloglucan Utilisation Loci (XyGUL). Flavobacterium XyGUL is a hybrid of the molecular machinery found in gut Bacteroides spp., Cellvibrio japonicus, and the plant pathogen Xanthomonas. Combining protein biochemistry, computational modelling and phylogenetics, we identified a mutation in the enzyme required for initiating hydrolysis of the XyG polysaccharide, an outer membrane endoxyloglucanase glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 4 (GH5_4), which enhances activity towards XyG. A subclade of GH5_4 homologs carrying this mutation were the dominant form found in soil and plant metagenomes due to their occurrence in Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria. However, only in members of the Bacteroidota spp., particularly Flavobacterium spp. was such a remarkable degree of XyGUL conservation detected. We propose this mechanism enables plant-associated Flavobacterium to specialise in competitive acquisition of XyG exudates and that this hemicellulose may represent an important nutrient source, enabling them to thrive in the plant microbiome, which is typified by intense competition for low molecular weight carbon exudates.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

However, it remains unclear whether other phospholipid peroxidases can also contribute to ferroptosis prevention, albeit to a varying degree. Here we show that cells lacking GPX4 still exhibit substantial PLOOH reduction capacity, arguing for the presence of alternative PLOOH peroxidases. By scrutinizing potential candidates, we showed that while overexpression of peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), a thiol-specific antioxidant enzyme with reported PLOOH-reducing activity, failed to prevent ferroptosis, its genetic loss markedly sensitizes cancer cells to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, we uncover that PRDX6 facilitates intracellular selenium handling, which is crucial for selenium incorporation into selenoproteins, including GPX4. Consequently, PRDX6 modulates GPX4 expression, thereby dictating the sensitivity of cells to undergo ferroptosis. Our study highlights PRDX6 as a critical factor in ferroptosis prevention by directing cellular selenium mobilization.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Using transcriptomics analysis, we show that during their two-day period of growth deceleration, wing imaginal discs of Drosophila undergo a progressive metabolic shift away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis. We then develop an ultra-sensitive reporter HIF-1 activity, which reveals that imaginal discs become increasingly hypoxic during development in normoxic conditions, suggesting that limiting oxygen supply could underlie growth deceleration. Growth is energetically expensive and thus expected to contribute, indirectly, to oxygen consumption. Indeed, excess TOR signalling, a key stimulator of growth, triggers hypoxia locally and systemically, highlighting the need to rein in growth when oxygen becomes limiting. This is achieved by a negative feedback loop whereby the classic TOR-inhibitory function of HIF-1 is deployed in response to developmental hypoxia. The absence of Sima/HIF-1 leads to cellular stress, which is alleviated by reduced TOR signalling. Conversely, a small increase in oxygen supply reduces the stress induced by excess TOR activity. We conclude that mild hypoxia is a normal feature of organ development and that Sima/HIF-1 prevents growth-induced oxygen demand from exceeding supply.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Initially described as components of the vault particle, they have since also been described as noncanonical miRNA precursors and as riboregulators of autophagy. As central molecules in these processes, vRNAs have been attributed numerous biological roles including regulation of cell proliferation and survival, response to viral infections, drug resistance, and animal development. Yet, their impact to mammalian physiology remains largely unexplored. To study vault RNAs in vivo, we generated a mouse line with a conditional Vaultrc5 loss of function allele. Because Vaultrc5 is the sole murine vRNA, this allele enables the characterization of the physiological requirements of this conserved class of small regulatory RNAs in mammals. Using this strain, we show that mice constitutively null for Vaultrc5 are viable and histologically normal but have a slight reduction in platelet counts pointing to a potential role for vRNAs in hematopoiesis. This work paves the way for further in vivo characterizations of this abundant but mysterious RNA molecule.

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound.

The layers and areas are distinguished both molecularly, by diverse neuronal and glial cell subtypes, and structurally, through intricate spatial organization. While single-cell transcriptomics studies have advanced molecular characterization of human cortical development, a critical gap exists due to the loss of spatial context during cell dissociation. Here, we utilized multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), augmented with deep-learning-based cell segmentation, to examine the molecular, cellular, and cytoarchitectural development of human fetal cortex with spatially resolved single-cell resolution. Our extensive spatial atlas, encompassing 16 million single cells, spans eight cortical areas across four time points in the second and third trimesters. We uncovered an early establishment of the six-layer structure, identifiable in the laminar distribution of excitatory neuronal subtypes by mid-gestation, long before the emergence of cytoarchitectural layers. Notably, while anterior-posterior gradients of neuronal subtypes were generally observed in most cortical areas, a striking exception was the sharp molecular border between primary (V1) and secondary visual cortices (V2) at gestational week 20. Here we discovered an abrupt binary shift in neuronal subtype specification at the earliest stages, challenging the notion that continuous morphogen gradients dictate mid-gestation cortical arealization. Moreover, integrating single-nuclei RNA-sequencing and in situ whole transcriptomics revealed an early upregulation of synaptogenesis in V1-specific Layer 4 neurons, suggesting a role of synaptogenesis in this discrete border formation. Collectively, our findings underscore the crucial role of spatial relationships in determining the molecular specification of cortical layers and areas. This work not only provides a valuable resource for the field, but also establishes a spatially resolved single-cell analysis paradigm that paves the way for a comprehensive developmental atlas of the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

However, many metazoan groups, such as the extremely diverse molluscs, are still underrepresented in the number of sequenced and annotated genomes. Although sequencing techniques have recently improved in quality and quantity, molluscs are still neglected due to difficulties in applying standardized protocols for obtaining genomic data. Results: In this study, we present the chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of the marine sacoglossan species Elysia timida, known for its ability to store the chloroplasts of its food algae. In particular, by optimizing the Long-read and chromosome conformation capture library preparations, the genome assembly was performed using PacBio HiFi and Arima HiC data. The scaffold and contig N50s, at 41.8 Mb and 1.92 Mb, respectively, are 100-fold and 4-fold higher compared to other published sacoglossan genome assemblies. Structural annotation resulted in 19,904 protein-coding genes, which are more contiguous and complete compared to publicly available annotations of Sacoglossa. We detected genes encoding polyketide synthases in E. timida, indicating that polypropionates are produced. HPLC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the presence of a large number of polypropionates, including known and yet uncharacterised compounds. Conclusions: We can show that our methodological approach helps to obtain a high-quality genome assembly even for a ""difficult-to-sequence"" organism, which may facilitate genome sequencing in molluscs. This will enable a better understanding of complex biological processes in molluscs, such as functional kleptoplasty in Sacoglossa, by significantly improving the quality of genome assemblies and annotations.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Extensive genome sequencing efforts are currently in progress across a broad spectrum of life forms, holding the potential to unravel the intricate branching patterns within the tree of life. However, estimating species trees starting from raw genome sequences is quite challenging, and the current cutting-edge methodologies require a series of error-prone steps that are neither entirely automated nor standardized. In this paper, we present ROADIES, a novel pipeline for species tree inference from raw genome assemblies that is fully automated, easy to use, scalable, free from reference bias, and provides flexibility to adjust the tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. The ROADIES pipeline eliminates the need to align whole genomes, choose a single reference species, or pre-select loci such as functional genes found using cumbersome annotation steps. Moreover, it leverages recent advances in phylogenetic inference to allow multi-copy genes, eliminating the need to detect orthology. Using the genomic datasets released from large-scale sequencing consortia across three diverse life forms (placental mammals, pomace flies, and birds), we show that ROADIES infers species trees that are comparable in quality with the state-of-the-art approaches but in a fraction of the time. By incorporating optimal approaches and automating all steps from assembled genomes to species and gene trees, ROADIES is poised to improve the accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility of phylogenomic analyses.

MethodsIn this randomised, controlled, open-label, adaptive platform trial, several potential treatments for patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were assessed in separate comparisons in RECOVERY, both of which are reported here. Eligible and consenting adults could join the molnupiravir comparison, the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, or both. For each comparison, participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to the relevant antiviral (five days of molnupiravir 800mg twice daily or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir 300mg/100mg twice daily) or to usual care without the relevant antiviral drug, using web-based unstratified randomisation with allocation concealment. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Both comparisons were stopped by the investigators because of low recruitment. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsFrom 24 January 2022 to 24 May 2023, 923 patients were recruited to the molnupiravir comparison (445 allocated molnupiravir and 478 allocated usual care), and from 31 March 2022 to 24 May 2023, 137 patients were recruited to the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison (68 allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 69 allocated usual care). More than three-quarters of the patients in both comparisons were vaccinated and had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals (including remdesivir or sotrovimab). In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) patients allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.28; p=0.66). In the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison, 13 (19%) patients allocated nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and 13 (19%) patients allocated usual care died within 28 days (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.47-2.23; p=0.96). In neither comparison was there evidence of a significant difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the proportion of patients progressing to invasive ventilation or death.

InterpretationIn adults hospitalised with COVID-19, neither molnupiravir nor nirmatrelvir-ritonavir were associated with reductions in 28-day mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death although these comparisons had limited statistical power due to low recruitment.

Furthermore, detection of relatively scarce isoform-specific peptides is challenging, with many protein isoforms remaining uncharted due to technical limitations. Recently, a family of advanced targeted MS strategies, termed internal standard parallel reaction monitoring (IS-PRM), have demonstrated multiplexed, sensitive detection of pre-defined peptides of interest. Such approaches have not yet been used to confirm existence of novel peptides. Here, we present a targeted proteogenomic approach that leverages sample-matched long-read RNA sequencing (LR RNAseq) data to predict potential protein isoforms with prior transcript evidence. Predicted tryptic isoform-specific peptides, which are specific to individual gene product isoforms, serve as ""triggers"" and ""targets"" in the IS-PRM method, Tomahto. Using the model human stem cell line WTC11, LR RNAseq data were generated and used to inform the generation of synthetic standards for 192 isoform-specific peptides (114 isoforms from 55 genes). These synthetic ""trigger"" peptides were labeled with super heavy tandem mass tags (TMT) and spiked into TMT-labeled WTC11 tryptic digest, predicted to contain corresponding endogenous ""target"" peptides. Compared to DDA mode, Tomahto increased detectability of isoforms by 3.6-fold, resulting in the identification of five previously unannotated isoforms. Our method detected protein isoform expression for 43 out of 55 genes corresponding to 54 resolved isoforms. This LR RNA seq-informed Tomahto targeted approach, called LRP-IS-PRM, is a new modality for generating protein-level evidence of alternative isoforms - a critical first step in designing functional studies and eventually clinical assays.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592226

Here we establish that focal injection of sonicated human FUS fibrils into brains of mice in which ALS-linked mutant or wild-type human FUS replaces endogenous mouse FUS is sufficient to induce focal cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of mutant and wild-type FUS which with time spreads to distal regions of the brain. Human FUS fibril-induced FUS aggregation in the mouse brain of humanized FUS mice is accelerated by an ALS-causing FUS mutant relative to wild-type human FUS. Injection of sonicated human FUS fibrils does not induce FUS aggregation and subsequent spreading after injection into naive mouse brains containing only mouse FUS, indicating a species barrier to human FUS aggregation and its prion-like spread. Fibril-induced human FUS aggregates recapitulate pathological features of FTLD including increased detergent insolubility of FUS and TAF15 and amyloid-like, cytoplasmic deposits of FUS that accumulate ubiquitin and p62, but not TDP-43. Finally, injection of sonicated FUS fibrils is shown to exacerbate age-dependent cognitive and behavioral deficits from mutant human FUS expression. Thus, focal seeded aggregation of FUS and further propagation through prion-like spread elicits FUS-proteinopathy and FTLD-like disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Such dimorphism, which reflects responses to selection acting in opposite directions for male and female components of fitness, is commonly thought to emerge after separate sexes evolved from hermaphroditism. But associations between allocation to male and female function and traits under sexual conflict could also begin to evolve in hermaphroditic ancestors, and fuel transitions to dioecy. Here, we show that variation in sex allocation and a trait under sexual conflict inevitably generates an advantage to sexual specialisation. In the absence of constraints, this leads to the joint evolution of separate sexes and sexual dimorphism through the build up of an association between sex allocation and the conflict trait, such that eventually the population consists of unisexuals expressing their sex-specific trait optima. We then investigate how such association might materialise genetically, either via recombination suppression or via sex-dependent expression, and show that the genetic architecture of sex allocation and the conflict trait readily evolves to produce the association favoured by selection. Finally, we demonstrate that limited dispersal and self-fertilisation, which are pervasive ecological characteristics of flowering plants, can offset the advantage of sexual specialisation generated by a jointly evolving trait under sexual conflict and maintain hermaphroditism, in agreement with previous theory where sex allocation evolves alone. Taken together, our results indicate that advantages to sexual specialisation are inevitable when there is conflict between sexual functions in hermaphrodites, but can be counterbalanced by ecological benefits of hermaphroditism, underscoring the importance of ecology for sexual system evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Here, we introduce a scalable method for the parallel measurement of protein-based library barcodes and metabolites using flow-injection mass spectrometry (FI-MS). Protein barcodes are based on ubiquitin, a small 76-amino-acid protein, which we labeled with N-terminal tags of six amino acids to identify bacterial strains. We demonstrate that FI-MS effectively detects intact ubiquitin proteins and identifies the N-terminal barcodes. In the same analysis, we semi-quantify relative concentrations of primary metabolites. As a proof of concept, we engineered six ubiquitin-barcoded CRISPRi strains targeting metabolic enzymes, and analyzed their metabolic profiles and ubiquitin barcodes using FI-MS. Our results show distinct metabolome changes within metabolic pathways targeted by CRISPRi. This method enables fast and simultaneously detection of library barcodes and intracellular metabolites, opening up new possibilities to measure metabolomes of engineered bacteria at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Previous studies have mainly examined relative brain size, but a comprehensive understanding of brain diversity requires the investigation of other aspects of their neuroanatomy. Here, we obtained primarily post-mortem brain scans from eighteen species of the order Carnivora, reconstructed their cortical surfaces, and examined neocortical sulcal anatomy to establish a framework for systematic inter-species comparisons. We observed distinct regional variations in sulcal anatomy, potentially related to the species behaviour and ecology. Arctoidea species with pronounced forepaw dexterity exhibited complex sulcal configurations in the presumed somatosensory cortex but low sulcal complexity in the presumed visual and auditory occipitotemporal cortex. Canidae had the largest number of unique major sulci with a unique sulcus in the occipital cortex and highly social canids featuring an additional frontal cortex sulcus. We also observed differentially complex occipito-temporal sulcal patterns in Felidae and Canidae, indicative of changes in auditory and visual areas that may be related to foraging strategies and social behaviour. In conclusion, this study presents an inventory of the sulcal anatomy of a number of rarely studied carnivoran brains and establishes a framework and novel avenues for further investigations employing a variety of neuroimaging modalities to reveal more about carnivoran brain diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

We compared binding specificities, neutralizing capacities, developing origins and targeting epitopes of monoclonal antibodies from individuals with or without immune imprinting. Although receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N- terminal domain (NTD) of spike are both primary targets for neutralizing antibodies, immune imprinting only shapes antibody responses to RBD by impeding the production of Omicron-specific neutralizing antibodies while facilitating the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies.

These condensates emerge from the programmed interactions of nanostructured motifs assembling from three DNA strands and one RNA strand that can include an aptamer domain for the recruitment of a target protein. Because condensates are designed to form regardless of the presence of target protein, they function as 'host' compartments. As a model protein we consider streptavidin (SA) due to its widespread use in binding assays, thus the host condensates presented here could find immediate use for the physical separation of a variety of biotin-tagged components. In addition to demonstrating protein recruitment, we describe two approaches to control the onset of condensation and protein recruitment. The first approach uses UV irradiation, a physical stimulus that bypasses the need for exchanging molecular inputs and is particularly convenient to control condensation in emulsion droplets. The second approach uses RNA transcription, a ubiquitous biochemical reaction that is central to the development of the next generation of living materials. We finally show that the combination of RNA transcription and degradation leads to an autonomous dissipative system in which host condensates and protein recruitment occur transiently, and that the host condensate size as well as the timescale of the transient can be controlled by the level of RNA degrading enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Among various spatial omics methods, genome-scale imaging allows transcriptomic, 3D-genomic, and epigenomic profiling of individual cells with high spatial (subcellular) resolution but often requires a preselection of targeted genes or genomic loci. On the other hand, spatially dependent barcoding of molecules followed by sequencing provides untargeted, genome-wide profiling but typically lacks single-cell resolution. Here, we report a spatial omics method that could potentially combine the power of the two approaches by optically controlled spatial barcoding followed by sequencing. Specifically, we utilize patterned light to encode the locations of cells in tissues using oligonucleotide-based barcodes and then identify the barcoded molecular content, such as mRNAs, by sequencing. This optical barcoding method is designed with multiplexing and error-correction capacity and achieved by a light-directed ligation chemistry that attaches distinct nucleic-acid sequences to the reverse transcribed cDNA products at different locations. As a proof of principle for this method, we demonstrated high-efficiency in situ light-directed ligation, spatially dependent barcoding with multiplexed light-controlled ligations, and high-accuracy detection of spatially barcoded mRNAs in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

With mounting challenges in fungal control and increasing restrictions on fungicide use due to environmental concerns, there is an urgent need for innovative control strategies. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the stage-specific infection process of Fusarium graminearum in wheat spikes by generating a dual weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN). Notably, the network contained a mycotoxin-enriched fungal module that exhibited a significant correlation with a detoxification gene-enriched wheat module. This correlation in gene expression was validated through quantitative PCR.

By examining a fungal module with genes highly expressed during early symptomless infection, we identified a gene encoding FgKnr4, a protein containing a Knr4/Smi1 disordered domain. Through comprehensive analysis, we confirmed the pivotal role of FgKnr4 in various biological processes, including morphogenesis, growth, cell wall stress tolerance, and pathogenicity. Further studies confirmed the observed phenotypes are partially due to the involvement of FgKnr4 in regulating the fungal cell wall integrity pathway by modulating the phosphorylation of the MAP-kinase MGV1. Orthologues of FgKnr4 are widespread across the fungal kingdom but are absent in other Eukaryotes, suggesting the protein has potential as a promising intervention target. Encouragingly, the restricted growth and highly reduced virulence phenotypes observed for{Delta} Fgknr4 were replicated upon deletion of the orthologous gene in the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of an integrated network-level analytical approach to pinpoint genes of high interest to pathogenesis and disease control.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Polymer structure and modifications, however, depend on the ensemble of synthase modules and accessory subunits, thus defining several types of bacterial cellulose secretion (Bcs) systems. In E. coli, a BcsRQABEFG macrocomplex, encompassing the inner membrane and cytosolic subunits, and an outer membrane porin, BcsC, secure the biogenesis of phosphoethanolamine (pEtN)-modified cellulose. Resolution-limited studies have proposed different macrocomplex stoichiometries and its assembly and regulation have remained elusive. Using cryo-EM, we visualize the molecular mechanisms of BcsA-dependent recruitment and stabilization of a trimeric BcsG pEtN-transferase for polymer modification and a dimeric BcsF-dependent recruitment of an otherwise cytosolic BcsE2R2Q2 regulatory complex. We further demonstrate that BcsE, a secondary c-di-GMP sensor, remains dinucleotide-bound and retains the essential-for-secretion BcsRQ partners onto the synthase even in the absence of direct c-di-GMP-synthase complexation, likely lowering the threshold for c-di-GMP-dependent synthase activation. Such activation-by-proxy mechanism could allow Bcs secretion system activation even in the absence of dramatic intracellular c-di-GMP increase and is reminiscent of other widespread synthase-dependent polysaccharide secretion systems where c-di-GMP sensing and/or synthase stabilization are carried out by key co-polymerase subunits.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

In post-mortem tissue, there is significant infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the brain parenchyma, however their role in disease progression is unknown. To determine the role of CD8+ T cells, a modified AAV, Olig001-SYN, was used to selectively overexpress -syn in oligodendrocytes modeling MSA in mice. Four weeks post transduction, we observed significant CD8+ T cell infiltration into the striatum of Olig001-SYN transduced mice recapitulating the CD8+ T cell infiltration observed in post-mortem tissue. To understand the role of CD8+ T cells, a CD8 knockout mice were transduced with Olig001-SYN. Six months post transduction into a mouse lacking CD8+ T cells, demyelination and neurodegeneration were unchanged.

To understand how the microbiome can impact microsporidia infection, we tested how bacterial isolates that naturally occur with Caenorhabditis elegans influence infection by the microsporidian Nematocida parisii. Nematodes exposed to two of these bacteria, Chryseobacterium scopthalmum and Sphingobacterium multivorum, exhibit reduced pathogen loads. Using untargeted metabolomics, we show that unsaturated fatty acid levels are disrupted by growth on these bacteria and that supplementation with the polyunsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid can restore full parasite growth in animals cultured on S. multivorum. We also found that two isolates, Pseudomonas lurida and Pseudomonas mendocina, secrete molecules that inactivate N. parisii spores. We determined that P. lurida inhibits N. parisii through the production of massetolides. We then measured 53 additional Pseudomonas strains, 64% of which significantly reduced N. parisii infection. A mixture of Pseudomonas species can greatly limit the amount of infection in C. elegans populations over many generations. Our findings suggest that interactions between bacteria and N. parisii are common and that these bacteria both modulate host metabolism and produce compounds that inhibit microsporidia infection.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

A recent model finds that, when sublinear growth rates of species are coupled with competition, species diversity can stabilize community dynamics. This, in turn, is suggested to explain the coexistence of many species in natural ecosystems. In this brief note we clarify why the sublinear growth (SG) model does not solve the long standing paradox of species coexistence. This is because in the SG model coexistence emerges from an unrealistic property, in which species per-capita growth rate diverges at low abundance, preventing species from ever going extinct. When infinite growth at low abundance is reconciled with more realistic assumptions, the SG model recovers the expected paradox: increasing diversity leads to competitive exclusion and species extinctions.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Recently, it was shown that AP-3 is in a constitutively open, active conformation compared to the related AP-1 and AP-2 coat complexes, which are inactive until undergoing large conformational changes upon membrane recruitment. How AP-3 is regulated is therefore an open question. To understand the mechanism of AP-3 membrane recruitment and activation, we reconstituted the core of human AP-3 and determined multiple structures in the soluble and membrane-bound states using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Similar to yeast AP-3, human AP-3 is in a constitutively open conformation, with the cargo-binding domain of the 3 subunit conformationally free. To reconstitute AP-3 activation by the small GTPase Arf1, we used lipid nanodiscs to build Arf1-AP-3 complexes on membranes and determined three structures that show the stepwise conformational changes required for formation of AP-3 coated vesicles. First, membrane-recruitment is driven by one of two predicted Arf1 binding sites on AP-3. In this conformation, AP-3 is flexibly tethered to the membrane and its cargo binding domain remains conformationally dynamic. Second, cargo binding causes AP-3 to adopt a fixed position and rigidifies the complex, which stabilizes binding for a second Arf1 molecule. Finally, binding of the second Arf1 molecule provides the template for AP-3 dimerization, providing a glimpse into the first step of coat polymerization. We propose coat polymerization only occurs after cargo engagement, thereby linking cargo sorting with assembly of higher order coat structures. Additionally, we provide evidence for two amphipathic helices in AP-3, suggesting that AP-3 contributes to membrane deformation during coat assembly. In total, these data provide evidence for the first stages of AP-3 mediated vesicle coat assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Recurrent neural network models relying on persistent neural activity have been challenged by the observation of periods of absent activity and information during memory maintenance, implying the existence of activity-silent mechanisms. To assess whether activity-silent mechanisms are needed for working memory maintenance we recorded neural activity in macaque prefrontal cortex during a delayed-saccade task. We replicated the observation of periods of absent activity and decreased information between bursts of gamma power, but we show that these results are consistent with models that rely exclusively on persistent activity.

We explore ProteinMPNN in the context of designing therapeutic proteins that need to avoid triggering unwanted immune reactions. More specifically, we focus on intra-cellular proteins that face the challenge of evading detection by Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) that detect their presence via the MHC Class I (MHC-I) pathway. To reduce visibility of the designed proteins to this immune-system component, we develop a framework that uses the large language model (LLM) tuning method, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to guide ProteinMPNN in minimizing the number of predicted MHC-I epitopes in its designs. Our goal is to design proteins with low MHC-I immune-visibility while preserving the original structure and function. For our assessment, we first use AlphaFold to predict the 3D structures of designed protein sequences. We then use TM-score, that measures the structural alignment between the predicted design and original protein, to evaluate fidelity to the original protein structure. We find our LLM-based tuning method for constraining MHC-I visibility is able to effectively reduce visibility without compromising structural similarity to the original protein.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

We build on previous research characterizing changes in physiology and morphology to explore behavioral variation across the invasive range of coqui in Hawaii. We hypothesized that behavioral traits contributing to invasion expansion would be reflected in behavioral differences at the invasive center versus invasive edge. To investigate whether differences in the field represent local adaptation or behavioral plasticity, we additionally evaluated behavior following acclimation to a shared laboratory environment. While we identified only subtle behavioral variation among populations in the field, we found that individuals from all populations became less bold, active, and exploratory in the laboratory, converging on a similar behavioral phenotype. Alongside previous work, our results suggest that coqui adjust their behavior to local environmental conditions across their invasive range, and that behavioral flexibility may contribute to invasive success.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Despite this emerging paradigm, we lack tools to describe, quantify, predict, and interpret these types of structurally heterogeneous interactions from the underlying amino acid sequences. Here, we repurpose the chemical physics developed originally for molecular simulations to develop an approach for predicting intermolecular interactions between IDRs and partner proteins.

It is unknown, however, whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) also evokes an epigenetic muscle memory. This study employed repeated training intervention interspersed with a detraining period to assess epigenetic memory of HIIT.

METHODSTwenty healthy subjects (25{+/-}5yrs) completed two HIIT interventions (training and retraining) lasting 2 months, separated by 3 months of detraining. Measurements at baseline, after training, detraining and retraining included maximal oxygen consumption ([V]O2max). Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken for genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted gene expression analyses. RESULTS: [V]O2max improved during training and retraining (p<0.001) without differences between interventions (p>0.58). Thousands of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) predominantly demonstrated a hypomethylated state after training, retained even after 3-months exercise cessation and into retraining. Five genes; ADAM19, INPP5a, MTHFD1L, CAPN2, SLC16A3 possessed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with retained hypomethylated memory profiles and increased gene expression. The retained hypomethylation during detraining was associated with an enhancement in expression of the same genes even after 3 months of detraining. SLC16A3, INPP5a, CAPN2 are involved in lactate transport and calcium signaling.

CONCLUSIONSDespite similar physiological adaptations between training and retraining, memory profiles were found at epigenetic and gene expression level, characterized by retained hypomethylation and increased gene expression after training into long-term detraining and retraining. These genes were associated with calcium signaling and lactate transport. Whilst significant memory was not observed in physiological parameters, our novel findings indicate that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of HIIT.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

This process maintains redox homeostasis and supports anaerobic survival across diverse microbial communities. Although mediated EET has been extensively leveraged for bioelectrocatalysis and bioelectronics for decades, fundamental questions remain about how these redox shuttles are reduced within cells and their bioenergetic implications. This knowledge gap limits our understanding of the physiological roles of mediated EET in various microbes and hampers the development of efficient microbial electrochemical technologies. To address this, we developed a methodology integrating genome editing, electrochemistry, and systems biology to investigate the mechanism and bioenergetic implications of mediated EET in bacteria. Using this approach, we uncovered a mediated EET mechanism in Escherichia coli. In the absence of alternative electron sinks, the redox cycling of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (HNQ) via a cytoplasmic nitroreductase enabled E. coli to respire and grow on an extracellular electrode. Genome-scale metabolic modeling suggested that HNQ- mediated EET offers a more energetically favorable route for supporting anaerobic growth than canonical fermentation. Transcriptome analysis revealed redox perturbations in response to HNQ and identified rapid metabolic adaptations that support growth. This work demonstrates that E. coli can grow independently of classical electron transport chains and fermentative pathways, unveiling a new type of anaerobic energy metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

We find that invasive cancer cells are prevalent in ulcerated BCC tumors and exhibit a distinctive spatial organization. To explore the causal relationship between wounding and cancer progression, we compare tumors at baseline and one week after biopsy. Our results reveal that biopsy collection locally induces a transcriptional switch in cancer cells from an indolent to an invasive state. Notably, this progression is coupled with the reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts, which adopt a transcriptional state characteristic of therapy-resistant BCC. This study provides evidence that wounding triggers invasive progression of established human tumors and warrants further research on the potentially harmful effects of biopsies and wound-inducing treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Phase separation is mediated by multivalent interactions of biological macromolecules including intrinsically disordered proteins and regions (IDRs). Despite considerable advances in experiments, theory and simulations, the prediction of the thermodynamics of IDR phase behaviour remains challenging. We combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and active learning to develop a fast and accurate machine learning model to predict the free energy and saturation concentration for phase separation directly from sequence. We validate the model using both experimental and computational data. We apply our model to all 27,663 IDRs of chain length up to 800 residues in the human proteome and find that 1,420 of these (5%) are predicted to undergo homotypic phase separation with transfer free energies < -2kBT. We use our model to understand the relationship between single-chain compaction and phase separation, and find that changes from charge-to hydrophobicity-mediated interactions can break the symmetry between intra-and inter-molecular interactions. We also analyse the structural preferences at condensate interfaces and find substantial heterogeneity that is determined by the same sequence properties as phase separation. Our work refines the established rules governing the relationships between sequence features and phase separation propensities, and our prediction models will be useful for interpreting and designing cellular experiments on the role of phase separation, and for the design of IDRs with specific phase separation propensities.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Each software tool for searching such data uses its own internally developed methodology for reporting and controlling the error. Many of these software tools are closed source, with incompletely documented methodology, and the strategies for validating the error are inconsistent across tools. In this work, we identify three different methods for validating false discovery rate (FDR) control in use in the field, one of which is invalid, one of which can only provide a lower bound rather than an upper bound, and one of which is valid but under-powered. The result is that the field has a very poor understanding of how well we are doing with respect to FDR control, particularly for the analysis of DIA data. We therefore propose a new, more powerful method for evaluating FDR control in this setting, and we then employ that method, along with an existing lower bounding technique, to characterize a variety of popular search tools. We find that the search tools for analysis of data-dependent acquisition data generally seem to control the FDR at the peptide level, whereas none of the data-independent acquisition search tools consistently controls the FDR at the peptide level across all the datasets we investigated. Furthermore, this problem becomes much worse when the latter tools are evaluated at the protein level. These result may have significant implications for various downstream analyses, since proper FDR control has the potential to reduce noise in discovery lists and thereby boost statistical power.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Using 32 great tit populations, spanning 3200km and >130,000 birds across 67 years, we quantify spatial synchrony in breeding age structure and its drivers. We show that larger clutch sizes, colder winters and summers, and larger beech crops lead to younger populations. We report distant-dependent spatial synchrony of age structure, which is maintained at approximately 650km. Despite covariation with age structure, reproductive and environmental variables do not influence the scale of synchrony, except for a moderate effect of beech masting. We suggest that local ecological and density-dependent dynamics impact how environmental variation interacts with age structure, influencing estimates of the environments effect on spatial synchrony. Our analyses demonstrate the operation of synchrony in age structure over large scales, with implications for age-dependent demography in populations.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

When present in healthy tissues in low numbers, we show that cells expressing cancer-causing mutations (KrasG12D, p53R172H) compete with normal cells for survival and are often eliminated. Thus, tumour initiation must require mechanisms whereby mutant cells override tissue defence mechanisms to remain in a tissue; however, the biology of these initial events is poorly understood. Here, we use an in vivo model of sporadic tumorigenesis in the adult pancreas to show that a population of KrasG12D- or p53R172H-expressing cells are never eliminated from the epithelium. Using RNA sequencing of non-eliminated populations and quantitative fluorescence imaging, we show that {beta}-catenin-independent Wnt5a signalling, and cell dormancy are key features of surviving KrasG12D cells in vivo. We demonstrate that Wnt5a (and not Wnt3a) inhibits apical extrusion of RasV12 cells in vitro by promoting stable E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesions at RasV12-normal cell-cell boundaries. Inhibition of Wnt5a signalling restores E-cadherin dynamics at normal-mutant boundaries and apical extrusion in vitro. RasV12 cells arrested in the cell cycle are not extruded and this is rescued when Wnt signalling is inhibited. In the pancreas, Wnt signalling, E-cadherin and {beta}-catenin are increased at cell-cell contacts between non-eliminated KrasG12D cells and normal neighbours. Importantly, we demonstrate that active Wnt signalling is a general mechanism required to promote KrasG12D and p53R172H cell survival in vivo. Treatment with porcupine inhibitor rescues pancreas tissue defence by switching mutant cell retention to cell expulsion. Our results suggest that RAS mutant cells activate Wnt and a dormant cell state to avoid cell expulsion and to survive in the adult pancreas.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Furthermore, the cell-intrinsic requirement for IL-7 signaling during memory homeostasis has not been directly tested. Using inducible deletion, we found that Il7ra loss had only a modest effect on persistence of circulating memory and TRM subsets and that IL-7R was primarily required for normal basal proliferation. Loss of IL-15 signaling imposed heightened IL-7R dependence on memory CD8+ T cells, including TRM populations previously described as IL-15-independent. In the absence of IL-15 signaling, IL-7R was upregulated, and loss of IL-7R signaling reduced proliferation in response to IL-15, suggesting cross-regulation in memory CD8+ T cells. Thus, across subsets and tissues, IL-7 and IL-15 act in concert to support memory CD8+ T cells, conferring resilience to altered availability of either cytokine.

HighlightsTissue-resident and circulating memory CD8+ T cells modestly decline after loss of IL-7R IL-7R is required for normal self-renewal of memory CD8+ T cells

Combined loss of IL-7 and IL-15 causes a profound defect across memory CD8+ T cell subsets Cross-regulation of IL-7 and IL-15 signaling occurs in memory CD8+ T cells

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1717711592227

Our findings reveal a significant reduction in PD occurrence following anti-tetanus vaccination, with a time-dependent association between the elapsed time since vaccination and both the rate and progression of PD.

We then utilize these weighted de Bruijn graphs to identify alternate, higher-likelihood candidate sequences compared to the original observations, which are known to contain errors. By improving the original observations with these resampled paths, iteratively across increasing k-lengths, we can use this expectation-maximization approach to ""polish"" read sets from any sequencing technology according to the mutual information shared in the reads. We use this polishing approach to probabilistically correct simulated short- and long-read datasets of lower coverages and higher error rates than some algorithms can produce satisfactory assemblies for.

Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3).

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time. A variant analysis suggests avian or bovine origin but other potential sources, especially humans, could not be excluded.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022).

Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

China has experienced notable pertussis upsurge post-COVID-19, alongside an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable rise in MRBP prevalence. We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024. We analysed strain and pertussis epidemiology dynamics by integrating whole-genome sequencing of 723 strains with antimicrobial susceptibility, transcriptomic proflie, and clinical data. We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

FundingNational Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2701800 and 2022YFC2304700), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202567 and 32270003), Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (2022278), Shanghai Rising-Star Program (23QA1410500), and Shanghai municipal three-year action plan for strengthening the construction of the public health system (2023-2025) GWVI-2.1.2.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717711592227

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera.

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine.

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717711592227

Recently, H5 viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b have caused large outbreaks in avian and multiple non-human mammalian species1,2. Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains.

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717711592227
