By degrading damaged or unwanted components, autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis. While the organismal phenotypes of autophagy deficient plants under stress are well characterized, the contribution of cell type specific autophagy responses to whole plant homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that root hair forming cells (trichoblasts) of Arabidopsis thaliana exhibit higher autophagic flux than adjacent nonhair cells (atrichoblasts). This differential autophagy is genetically linked to cell fate determination during early development. Mutants disrupting trichoblast or atrichoblast identity lose the autophagy distinction between these cell types. Functional analyses reveal that elevated autophagy in trichoblasts is essential for sodium ion sequestration in vacuoles, a key mechanism for salt stress tolerance. Disrupting autophagy specifically in trichoblasts impairs sodium accumulation and reduces plant survival under salt stress. Conversely, cell type specific complementation restores both sodium sequestration and stress tolerance. Our findings uncover a cell type specific autophagy program in root hairs and demonstrate how developmental cues shape autophagy to enhance stress resilience. This work establishes a direct link between cell identity, autophagy, and environmental adaptation in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

While mechanisms governing root hair fate, polarity, and tip growth are well understood, the regulation of root hair longevity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that root hair cells employ high levels of autophagy to promote their lifespan. Loss-of-function mutations in the autophagy regulators ATG2, ATG5, or ATG7 induce a premature, cell-autonomous cell death program. This cell death is activated via a gene regulatory network downstream of the NAC transcription factors ANAC046 and ANAC087. Our findings uncover an antagonistic relationship between autophagy and developmentally controlled cell death in root hair lifespan regulation, with potential implications for optimizing plant nutrient and water uptake in crop breeding.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Despite the critical role of IFN induction in host defense, numerous studies have established that most cells fail to produce IFNs in response to viral stimuli. The specific factors that govern cellular heterogeneity in IFN induction potential during infection are not understood. To identify specific host factors that license some cells but not others to mount an IFN response to viral infection, we developed an approach for analyzing temporal scRNA-seq data of influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells. This approach identified the expression of several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) within pre-infection cells as correlates of IFN induction potential of those cells, post-infection. Validation experiments confirmed that intrinsic expression of the ISG OASL is essential for robust IFNL induction during IAV infection. Altogether, our findings reveal an important role for IFN-independent, intrinsic expression of ISGs in promoting IFN induction and provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell heterogeneity in innate immune activation.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Our analyses revealed highly conserved euchromatin states at active gene promoters and gene bodies. In contrast, we observed diverse configurations of repressive heterochromatin states associated with silenced genes and transposable elements, characterized by various combinations of hPTMs such as H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and/or different H3K79 methylations.

Here, we identify a group of LTR retrotransposons that infect the germline from somatic cells within the Drosophila ovary, despite lacking the fusogenic Envelope protein typically required for retroviral entry. Instead, these elements encode a short transmembrane protein, sORF2, with structural features reminiscent of viral cell-cell fusogens. Through genetics, imaging, and electron microscopy, we show that sORF2 localizes to invasive somatic protrusions, enabling the direct transfer of retrotransposon capsids into the oocyte. Remarkably, sORF2-like proteins are widespread among insect retrotransposons and also occur in piscine nackednaviruses and avian picornaviruses. These findings reveal a noncanonical, Envelope-independent transmission mechanism shared by retrotransposons and non-enveloped viruses, offering important insights into host-pathogen evolution and soma-germline interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Bioinformatics, synthetic biology, and biochemical approaches were integrated to characterize PRRs from 285 plant species. We identified a receptor, named ""SCORE"", that perceives cold-shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit remarkable CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues.

In stem cells, we show this conditioning, as an adaptive response to the mechanostimuli, to correlate with a 'mechanopriming' effect that is responsible for their early induction towards an osteogenic lineage in as little as three days with just brief (10 mins) daily bursts of mechanostimulation, without the need for osteogenic factors.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Genome mining indicates that ferns encode a diverse repertoire of putative immune receptors, antimicrobial peptides and mediators of systemic acquired resistance. Ferns possess numerous RLKs/RLPs, resembling those required for cell-surface immunity in angiosperms.

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

Astrocytes, the primary homeostatic cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exhibit species-specific characteristics, with human astrocytes specifically displaying unique structural and functional features. It is thus essential to investigate human-specific astrocytic responses to neuropathology using human-relevant models. Varicose projection (VP) astrocytes, traditionally considered specific to humans and apes, were suggested to reflect pathological burden, albeit direct evidence linking them to neurological diseases has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that VP astrocytes are present in mice and tigers (Panthera tigris) and we provide evidence from four distinct human-based models that VP astrocytes are not a distinct physiological astrocyte subtype but rather a novel class of reactive astrocytes associated with neuropathology. Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes, mixed neural cultures, and cortical organoids, we showed that VP astrocytes are induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) or LPS. Notably, cytokine withdrawal reverses the VP phenotype of astrocytes, indicating that it is a transient, inflammation-dependent state. We characterized the distinctive components of varicosities, including markers for extracellular vesicles, mitochondria, Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum components, suggesting roles in cellular stress responses and metabolic dysregulation. We further validated the pathological relevance of VP astrocytes by documenting their significant enrichment in postmortem brain samples from patients with several neurodegenerative diseases including as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, as well as in surgical resections from patients with epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis or brain tumors, including previously unreported subcortical regions such as basal ganglia. Additionally, we identified a higher number of VP astrocytes also in mouse astrocytes upon treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that the formation of VP astrocytes is an evolutionarily conserved astrocytic response to neuroinflammation. Our findings point to VP astrocytes as a novel reactive astrocyte subtype closely linked to neuropathology, highlighting their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in neurological diseases. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the mechanisms driving VP astrocyte formation and their broader implications in neuropathology.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Heightened synaptic and structural plasticity of immature abDGCs is thought to govern their distinct contributions to circuit and network mechanisms of hippocampal-dependent memory operations. Protracted maturation or neoteny of abDGCs in higher mammals is hypothesized to offset decline in adult hippocampal neurogenesis by expanding the capacity for circuit and network plasticity underlying different memory operations. Here, we provide evidence for this hypothesis by genetically modelling the effective impact of neoteny of abDGCs on circuitry, network properties and social cognition in mice. We show that selective synchronous expansion of a single cohort of 4 weeks old immature, but not 8 weeks old mature abDGCs, increases functional recruitment of fast spiking parvalbumin expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) in CA3/CA2, number of PV IN-CA3/CA2 synapses, and GABAergic inhibition of CA3/CA2. This transient increase in feed-forward inhibition in DG-CA2 decreased social memory interference and enhanced social memory consolidation. In vivo local field potential recordings revealed that the expansion of a single cohort of 4-week-old abDGCs increased baseline power, amplitude, and duration, as well as sensitivity to social investigation-dependent rate changes of sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in CA1 and CA2, a neural substrate for memory consolidation. Inhibitory neuron-targeted chemogenetic manipulations implicate CA3/CA2 INs, including PV INs, as necessary and sufficient for social memory consolidation following neotenic expansion of the abDGC population and in wild-type mice, respectively. These studies suggest that neoteny of abDGCs may represent an evolutionary adaptation to support cognition by reconfiguring PV IN-CA3/CA2 circuitry and emergent network properties underlying memory consolidation.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

However, the ability of these ring-shaped DNA motors to navigate large DNA-bound obstacles, such as DNA/RNA polymerases and ribosomes in prokaryotes, has remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a bacterial SMC Wadjet complex can efficiently bypass obstacles larger than the SMC coiled coil lumen if they are linked to the extruded DNA by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). This process is mediated by the selective entrapment of the ssDNA linker within the SMC hinge channel, which acts as an obligate gate, permitting ssDNA passage while excluding double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). By threading the linker through the hinge gate as dsDNA is translocated through the SMC motor, the obstacle can follow a trajectory distinct from its associated dsDNA, remaining outside the SMC ring. This mechanism enables continuous dsDNA entrapment while successfully bypassing obstacles. We show that hinges of diverse SMC complexes including eukaryotic condensin and Smc5/6 also selectively accommodate ssDNA, suggesting that hinge bypass is a conserved feature across SMC proteins. We demonstrate that while the hinge domain is essential for obstacle bypass, it is dispensable for loop extrusion, showing that these functions are independent, provided by separate SMC modules. These findings uncover the long-sought function of the SMC hinge toroid and provide the first mechanistic explanation for how DNA-entrapping SMC complexes can extrude loops on chromosomal DNA densely populated with obstacles. Integrating hinge bypass into the DNA loop extrusion model, we propose that the hinge may also facilitate the passage of RNA and peptide, enabling bypass of transcription-associated ribonucleoprotein complexes and other SMC complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Here, we exploit an in vivo single-cell CRISPR screening strategy in the mouse epidermis to systematically investigate the tissue-wide function of microproteins. We document the global and cell-type-specific roles of microproteins during epidermal development and homeostasis at single-cell transcriptomic resolution. Focusing on select candidates, we identify a novel microprotein on Gm10076, identical to the ribosomal intersubunit bridge protein RPL41, whose perturbation strongly impairs proliferation and protein synthesis. Employing ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing, we show that Gm10076 perturbation profoundly reshapes the translational landscape. Contrary to its prior classification as nonessential, we find that the ribosomal protein RPL41 is essential for cellular proliferation, warranting further investigation into its role as an intersubunit bridge in the translational machinery. Together, our study comprehensively charts the tissue-wide functional landscape of the dark proteome, uncovers a second Rpl41 gene critical for ribosome function and establishes a basis for exploring the impact of microproteins on disease pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Many condensates have internal subdomains with distinct compositional identities. A major challenge lies in dissecting the multicomponent logic that relates biomolecular features to emergent condensate organization. Nuclear paraspeckles are paradigmatic examples of multi-domain condensates, comprising core and shell layers with distinct compositions that are scaffolded by the lncRNA NEAT1, which spans both layers. A prevailing model of paraspeckle assembly proposes that core proteins bind directly and specifically to core-associated NEAT1 domains. Combining informatics and biochemistry, we unexpectedly find that the essential core proteins FUS and NONO bind and condense preferentially with shell-associated NEAT1 domains. The shell protein TDP-43 exhibits similar NEAT1 domain preferences on its own but forms surfactant-like shell layers around core protein-driven condensates when both are present. Together, experiments and physics-based simulations suggest that competitive RNA binding and immiscibility between core and shell proteins orders paraspeckle layers. More generally, we propose that sub-condensate organization can spontaneously arise from a balance of collaborative and competitive protein binding to the same domains of a lncRNA.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

This study included 63,555 cases, 17,700 proxy cases with a family history of Parkinson's disease, and 1,746,386 controls, making it the largest investigation of Parkinson's disease genetic risk to date. Methods Meta-analyses were performed using standard fixed and random effect models for the European sub-populations, the case-control studies, and the population biobanks separately. Finally, all of the European ancestries for all study types as well as proxy cases were combined in our final cross-European meta-analysis. We estimated heritable risk across ancestry groups, investigated tissue and cell-type enrichment, and prioritized risk genes using public data to facilitate functional follow-up efforts. Results The final combined cross-European meta-analysis identified 134 risk loci (59 novel), with a total of 157 independent signals, significantly expanding our understanding of Parkinson's disease risk. Multi-omic data integration revealed that expression of the nominated risk genes are highly enriched in brain tissues, particularly in neuronal and astrocyte cell types. Additionally, we prioritized 33 high-confidence genes across these 134 loci for future follow-up studies. Conclusions By integrating diverse European populations and leveraging harmonized data from the Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2), we reveal new insight into the genetic architecture of Parkinson's disease. We identified a total of 134 risk loci, expanding the number of known loci associated with PD by approximately 24%. We also provided an initial layer of biological context to these results through follow-up analyses in an effort to facilitate follow-up studies and precision medicine efforts with the goal of advancing Parkinson's disease research.","NA","medrxiv",1742422117074

Here, we present high-resolution spatial transcriptomics of 40 postmortem brain samples from patients with Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and severe COVID-19. Analyzing over 1.5 million spatially resolved cells across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex revealed disease-specific transcriptional signatures with pronounced layer- and region-specificity. In Parkinson's disease, we identified stressed neurons creating distinctive microenvironmental gradients where metabolic and protein degradation pathways are elevated near stress epicenters, while regenerative processes increase with distance. COVID-19 brains displayed extensive peripheral immune cell infiltration, particularly in the subcortical white matter, accompanied by compromised blood-brain barrier and coordinated neuroinflammatory responses from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells. Integration of miRNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics uncovered layer-specific regulatory patterns, including neuroinflammation-associated miR-155. This atlas provides unprecedented insights into disease pathology and highlights the critical importance of spatial molecular context in understanding brain disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

We report that Prototaxites taiti was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi. Furthermore, our molecular composition analysis indicates that cell walls of P. taiti include aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic components most similar to fossilisation products of lignin, but no fossilisation products characteristic of chitin or chitosan, which are diagnostic of all groups of extant and extinct fungi, including those preserved in the Rhynie chert.

We present the first genome assembly for a species that is uniquely well-suited for the study of (a)sex in nature, Potamopyrgus antipodarum. This New Zealand snail is unusual in featuring multiple separate transitions from obligately sexual to obligately asexual reproduction, leading to the coexistence of phenotypically similar sexual and asexual forms, a feature that is required to directly study the maintenance of sex. These separately derived asexual lineages constitute separate evolutionary experiments, providing a powerful means of characterizing how the absence of sex affects genome evolution. Our genome assembly provides critical steps towards understanding causes and consequences of sex in this system and important resources for the rapidly growing P. antipodarum and molluscan genomics research community. In characterizing this genome, we uncovered unexpected evidence for a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD) in P. antipodarum.

The structure of such pedigrees is challenging to visualise. Being directed acyclic graphs, pedigrees can be represented as matrices. Common choices are the numerator relationship matrix, A, and the adjacency matrix, T. With these matrices, the structure of pedigrees can then, in principle, be visualised via principal component analysis (PCA). However, the naive PCA of matrices for large pedigrees is challenging due to computational and memory constraints. Results We present the open-access R package randPedPCA for rapid pedigree PCA using sparse matrices and randomised linear algebra. Our rapid pedigree PCA builds on the fact that matrix-vector multiplications with the numerator relationship matrix can be carried out implicitly using the extremely sparse inverse Cholesky factor of the numerator relationship matrix. We demonstrate the utility of randPedPCA using several simulated datasets of pedigrees and SNPs. We then demonstrate the performance of randPedPCA by analysing the pedigree of the UK Labrador Retriever breeding population of almost 1.5 million individuals. Conclusions The structure of pedigrees can be efficiently and rapidly visualised using scatterplots of principal component scores. For large pedigrees, this is considerably faster than rendering plots of a pedigree graph.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included.

This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D.

Some prior evidence for neural processing of perceived musical beat (periodic pulse) may be confounded by stimulus-driven neural activity. However, one study used frequency tagging, which measures electrical brain activity at frequencies present in a stimulus, to show increased brain activity at imagery-related frequencies when listeners imagined a metrical pattern while listening to an isochronous auditory stimulus (Nozaradan et al., 2011) in a manner that controlled for stimulus factors. It is unclear though whether this represents repeatable evidence for conscious perception of beat and whether the effect is influenced by relevant music experience, such as music and dance training. This registered report details the results of 13 independent conceptual replications of Nozaradan et al. (2011), all using the same vetted protocol. Listeners performed the same imagery tasks as in Nozaradan et al. (2011), with the addition of a behavioral task on each trial to measure conscious perception. Meta-analyses examined the effect of imagery condition, revealing smaller raw effect sizes (Binary: 0.03 uV, Ternary: 0.03 uV) than in the original study (Binary: 0.12 uV, Ternary: 0.20 uV) with no moderating effects of music or dance training. The difference in estimated effects sizes (this study: n = 152, p2 =.03 - .04; 2011 study: n = 8, p2 =.62 - .76) suggests that large sample sizes may be required to reliably observe these effects, which challenges the use of frequency tagging as a method to study (neural correlates of) beat perception. Furthermore, a binary logistic regression on individual trials revealed that only neural activity at the stimulus frequency predicted performance on the imagery-related task; contrary to our hypothesis, the neural activity at the imagery-related frequency was not a significant predictor. We discuss possible explanations for discrepancies between these findings and the original study and implications of the extensions provided by this registered report.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), precursors to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), promote cancer progression by suppressing anti-tumour immune responses. Hypersialylation of glycans on tumours engages Siglec receptors on immune cells, driving immune dysfunction, but its role in stromal-mediated immunosuppression remains unclear.

MethodsSialic acids and Siglec ligands were measured on CRC tissue, primary human CAFs, and tumour-conditioned-mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCTCS) and CAF using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells was assessed in ex vivo primary stromal and immune cell co-cultures and expression of Siglec-10 and immune cell phenotype markers and function were measured by flow cytometry. Using an immunocompetent Balb/c CT26 mouse model, we induced tumours with/without conditioned stromal cells, with/without pre-treatment of stromal cells with sialyltransferase inhibitor (3FAX) or sialidase (E610). We assessed the effect of stromal cell sialylation on macrophages and NK cells in the tumour and secondary lymphoid tissues by flow cytometry.

ResultsStromal cells, including CAFs, in CRC tumours are highly sialylated compared to epithelial cancer cells and are associated with high expression of ST6GalNAC6. Genetic knockdown of ST6GalNAC6 reduced the expression of stromal cell Siglec-10 ligands in MSCs. CAFs and MSCTCS induced Siglec-10 on macrophages and NK cells and impaired NK cell cytotoxicity. Sialidase treatment reduced Siglec-10 expression, restoring NK cell function. In vivo, desialylation of stromal cells increased macrophage activation (CD11b+CD80+) and reduced immunosuppressive marker expression (CD206, PD-L1, Siglec-G) in lymphoid tissues, indicating sustained systemic anti-tumour immunity. Intratumoural NK cells exhibited high Siglec-G expression and impaired cytotoxicity, and granzyme B expression significantly increased with sialidase treatment of stromal cells. In an inflammatory tumour model, inflammatory tumour-conditioned (iTCS) MSCs promoted metastasis and Siglec-G induction on NK cells and macrophages, both reversed by sialyltransferase inhibition, underscoring the effects of stromal modulation of innate immune cell function in inflammatory tumours.

ConclusionStromal cell sialylation modulates innate immune suppression in CRC via the sialic acid/Siglec axis. Targeting stromal sialylation restores NK cytotoxicity and macrophage activation, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for immunosuppressive stromal-rich tumours.

What is already known on this topicO_LIThe tumour microenvironment of consensus molecular subtype 4 (CMS4) colorectal cancer (CRC) is associated with high stromal burden, poor immune infiltration, poor response to anti-cancer therapies and thus poor patient prognosis. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have limited impact on stromal-rich CRC tumours, therefore highlighting the need to discover and target novel mechanisms of tumour immune evasion.
C_LIO_LIEmerging studies have highlighted that stromal cells in CRC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are highly sialylated, expressing even higher levels of sialic acid on their cell surface than epithelial cancer cells. Targeting stromal cell sialylation has unveiled promising data in restoring the anti-tumour activity of T cells and macrophages. There is a need to explore the effects of targeting stromal cell sialylation on other immune cells of the TME and to evaluate the Siglec/sialic acid axis of stromal and immune cells in resistant CRC tumours.
C_LI

What this study addsO_LIWe reveal ST6GalNAC6 as a sialyltransferase enzyme that regulates the production of Siglec-10 ligands in CRC stromal cells. Overexpression of ST6GalNAC6 and Siglec-10 correlated with poor survival in CRC and mesenchymal CRC tumours.
C_LIO_LIWe show for the first time an induction of Siglec-10 expression on macrophages and NK cells in stromal-immune co-culture experimental models with hypersialylated MSCs and CAFs in vitro and ex vivo. Targeting stromal cell sialylation increased NK cell cytotoxicity of CRC cells, indicating a direct functional role for stromal cell sialylation in immunosuppression.
C_LIO_LIAn immunogenic mouse model of CRC was used to evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting stromal cell sialylation in overcoming stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression in CRC. Sialic acid-targeting of stroma slowed tumour growth and reduced inflammation-driven metastasis. This was associated with greater infiltration and activation of macrophages and NK cells with stromal cell sialic acid depletion, highlighting stromal cell sialylation as a mechanism of innate immune cell suppression in stromal-rich CRC.
C_LI

How this study might affect Research, Practice or PolicyO_LIOur research provides insight into a novel mechanism of stromal cell-mediated immunosuppression of innate immune cells in CRC and may open up new avenues of research for targeting stromal cells in stromal-rich TMEs such as pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers.
C_LIO_LIOur research identifies a stromal cell effect of enhancing Siglec expression on tumour infiltrating innate immune cells as a novel immune checkpoint, which may be useful in identifying potential novel immunotherapeutic combinations in future.

We identified two major IBD sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by Viking settlements, continuous trade and people movements across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn likely influenced by urbanisation and Industrial Revolution. Further comparisons using other North Sea countries showed both shared and unique histories of genetic exchange with Denmark and Britain. Our study provides novel genetic evidence of migration across the North Sea from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. It highlights the power of nationwide biobanks in reconstructing fine-scale historical population movements among closely related populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

They hold promise in identifying individuals at increased risk for diseases, allowing earlier screening and interventions. Genotyping arrays, commonly used for PGS computation, are affordable and computationally efficient, while whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers a comprehensive view of genetic variation. Using the same set of individuals, we compared PGS derived from arrays and WGS across multiple traits to evaluate differences in predictive performance, portability across populations, and computational efficiency. We computed PGS for 10 traits across the spectrum of heritability and polygenicity in the three largest genetic ancestry groups in All of Us (European, African American, Admixed American), trained on the multi-ancestry meta-analyses from the Pan-UK Biobank. Using the clumping and thresholding (C+T) method, we found that WGS-based PGS outperformed array-based PRS for highly polygenic traits but showed differentially reduced accuracy for sparse traits in certain populations. This may be attributable to the lower allele frequency observed in clumped variants from WGS compared to arrays. Using the LD-informed PRS-CS method, we observed overall improved prediction performance compared to C+T, with WGS outperforming arrays across most non-cancer traits. In conclusion, while PGS computed using WGS generally provide superior predictive power with PRS-CS, the advantage over arrays is context-dependent, varying by trait, population, and the PGS method. This study provides insights into the complexities and potential advantages of using different genotype discovery approach for polygenic predictions in diverse populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is characterized by pneumococci invading blood (bacteremia), lungs (pneumonia), or brain and cerebrospinal fluid (meningitis). Meningitis remains an important global health concern because half of the survivors experience long-term neurological damage. The antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumococcal infections are {beta}-lactams and macrolides, however, S. pneumoniae is nowadays often resistant to one or several antibiotics, therefore novel antimicrobials are needed. Here, we found that the bacteriophage-derived Cpl-1 endolysin showed consistent antibacterial activity against {beta}-lactam- and macrolide-resistant pneumococcal clinical strains grown in human blood and human cerebrospinal fluid. Exploiting synergistic and additive mechanisms, supplementation of cpl-1 to either penicillin or erythromycin rescued human neuronal cells from the cytotoxicity of antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal infections. Finally, systemic administration of cpl-1 supplemented to penicillin in mice infected with penicillin-resistant pneumococci successfully reduced bacteremia, and, thanks to the efficient penetration across the blood-brain barrier, abolished bacterial load in the brain, resulting in increased (89%) survival accompanied by an asymptomatic course of infection. These findings strongly indicate that cpl-1 can restore antibiotic sensitivity against {beta}-lactam- and macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae, representing a fundamental adjunct therapy to standard-of-care antibiotics against multidrug-resistant IPD.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

In adult stem cells, epigenetic regulation maintains their identity and controls their differentiation during homeostasis or aging, but its direct role in tumorigenesis remains unclear. This work explores the function of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) in adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs). Disrupting core PRC1 components in ISCs induces the formation of small cell clusters devoid of intestinal markers, a novel phenotype linked to premature mortality under stress. Notably, transient PRC1 loss is sufficient for cluster formation. These clusters overproliferate and exhibit immortality in serial transplantations, leading to their designation as tumor-initiating intestinal cells (TIICs). While JAK/STAT signaling promotes TIIC formation, the TOLL/IMD immune pathways restrict their expansion independently of cell death. Altogether, our results highlight PRC1 as an epigenetic tumor suppressor in adult intestinal stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Performance was worse for unexpected long delays than for unexpected short delays, suggesting that WM may be tuned to expire in a delay-dependent manner.

TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins, many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the ""AtTIRome"") to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRome's cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure-function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the ""BB-loop"", a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins.

Pa has three complete QS circuits controlled by the regulators LasR, RhlR, and PqsR, that together activate hundreds of genes. In the well-studied strain PAO1, QS is organized hierarchically, with PqsR and RhlR activity dependent on LasR. This hierarchy depends on the non-QS transcription factor MexT; deletion of mexT allows for RhlR activity in the absence of LasR. We aimed to identify how MexT modulates the Pa QS architecture. We compared the transcriptome of PAO1 to that of PAO1{Delta}mexT and determined a MexT regulon. We identified two MexT-regulated operons that may affect the QS hierarchy: the efflux pump genes mexEF-oprN and the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) synthesis genes pqsABCDE. We tested whether the products of these genes affected the QS hierarchy. A mexEF knockout mutant, like a mexT deletion mutant, exhibited RhlR activity earlier, and to a higher magnitude, than wild-type PAO1. MexEF-OprN is known to export quinolones, and we found that exogenous addition of PQS, through PqsE, also resulted in earlier and higher magnitude of RhlR activity compared to wild-type PAO1. We also discovered alternate QS architectures in clinical isolates, where RhlR activity is not fully dependent on LasR. In these isolates, surprisingly, MexT does not influence the relationship between LasR and RhlR. Our work reveals a new suite of factors that regulate QS in Pa, with implications for bacterial behaviors in environmental and clinical settings.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Understanding gut environmental changes is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for gut health. However, non-invasive methods for continuous monitoring remain limited. The bacterial gut microbiota represents a powerful platform for continuous, non-invasive biosensing technologies for the gut environment, with genetically tractable commensal species like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) emerging as promising hosts for engineered biosensors. However, the availability of genetic tools for precise, modular environmental sensing and reporting control in B. theta remains limited. Here, we present an expanded genetic engineering toolkit for B. theta that enables precise, fluorescence-based environmental sensing of the gut environment. This toolkit includes (i) three libraries of orthogonally inducible promoters capable of driving fluorescence expression, (ii) a DNA-based system to tune repressor activity in B. theta, (iii) a resulting modular transcriptional reporter circuit that integrates native promoter activation with fluorescent outputs, and (iv) characterization of a novel plasmid integration mode in B. theta. To demonstrate the utility of these tools, we engineered biosensors for gut malabsorption, a condition characterized by increased luminal osmolality. Using identified osmolality-responsive native promoters from B. theta, we made biosensors capable of detecting changes in gut physiology through graded fluorescent outputs. These biosensors were validated both in vitro and in vivo using a murine model of laxative-induced malabsorption, where they enabled near real-time, non-invasive monitoring of single-cell response from fecal samples with sensitivity to subclinical malabsorption levels. By expanding the genetic toolkit for B. theta and demonstrating its use in a physiologically relevant context, this approach highlights the potential of engineered gut bacteria as a monitoring platform for diverse gut health applications.

The universally conserved F1Fo-ATP synthase regenerates ATP from ADP and Pi by harnessing a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient (pmf). Bacteria have evolved a wide diversity of pmf-forming proteins to make ATP using light, organic, and inorganic energy sources. Recently, we proposed that many bacteria survive using atmospheric trace gases to produce ATP when limited for other energy sources. However, there is no direct proof that atmospheric energy sources are sufficient to generate pmf or drive ATP synthesis. Here, we show that the membrane-associated hydrogen:quinone oxidoreductase Huc from Mycobacterium smegmatis enables ATP synthesis from air. Purified Huc couples H2 oxidation to the reduction of various ubiquinone and menaquinone analogues. We designed and optimised a minimal respiratory chain in which Huc is reconstituted into liposomes with a pmf-generating terminal oxidase and the ATP-generating F1Fo-ATP synthase. Our experiments show that passive hydrogen exchange from air to solution is sufficient for the electron transfer and pmf generation required to accumulate ATP. Finally, by combining continuous culture bioenergetics measurements with theoretical calculations, we show this process is sufficient for mycobacteria to sustain pmf and ATP synthesis (two ATP molecules per H2 oxidised) for maintenance energy requirements during nutrient starvation. These findings prove that atmospheric energy sources are dependable ""lifeline"" substrates that enable continuous energy conservation during nutrient starvation. In addition, this work provides a new tool for ATP production in synthetic applications, which unlike other approaches is traceless without by-product accumulation.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Using a quantitative 'native holdup' assay, we find that POLE2 selectively binds diverse NPF-containing peptides, including canonical EH-domain ligands (e.g., SYNJ1) and previously uncharacterized motifs.

However, the precise mechanism of Ca2+ oscillations and whether their control loop resides at the plasma membrane or intracellularly remain unresolved. By examining the dynamics of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Ca2+ sensor that activates the Orai1 channel on the plasma membrane for SOCE and in mast cells, we found that a significant proportion of cells exhibited STIM1 oscillations with the same periodicity as Ca2+ oscillations. These cortical oscillations, occurring in the cell's cortical region and shared with ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) contact site proteins, were only detectable using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). Notably, STIM1 oscillations could occur independently of Ca2+ oscillations. Simultaneous imaging of cytoplasmic Ca2+ and ER Ca2+ with SEPIA-ER revealed that receptor activation does not deplete ER Ca2+, whereas receptor activation without extracellular Ca2+ influx induces cyclic ER Ca2+ depletion. However, under such nonphysiological conditions, cyclic ER Ca2+ oscillations lead to sustained STIM1 recruitment, indicating that oscillatory Ca2+ release is neither necessary nor sufficient for STIM1 oscillations. Using optogenetic tools to manipulate ER-PM contact site dynamics, we found that persistent ER-PM contact sites reduced the amplitude of Ca2+ oscillations without alteration of oscillation frequency. Together, these findings suggest an active cortical mechanism governs the rapid dissociation of ER-PM contact sites, thereby controlling the amplitude of oscillatory Ca2+ dynamics during receptor-induced Ca2+ oscillations.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

To understand the broader implications of IFN-driven immune responses, we analyzed whole-blood transcriptomics, plasma proteomics, metabolomics, and immune cell profiling in COVID-19 patients and uninfected controls. Patients were stratified into low (LIS), moderate (MIS), and high (HIS) ISG expression clusters, independent of acute disease severity. HIS patients exhibited elevated inflammatory mediators (S100A8/A9, Neopterin) and altered metabolic profiles, yet immune activation patterns varied. Plasma from HIS cases induced differential activation in healthy neutrophils and monocytes, with severe HIS plasma showing reduced activation, suggesting the presence of suppressive soluble factors. Metabolomic analysis revealed widespread lipid metabolism dysregulation, including reductions in phospholipids, sphingolipids, and plasmalogens, which correlated with impaired immune activation. Branched-chain lipids and tryptophan metabolism products correlated strongly with monocyte and neutrophil activation, linking metabolic shifts to immune regulation. Despite IFN autoantibody detection in a subset of patients, no direct association with ISG expression was observed. These findings suggest that IFN-driven immune-metabolic dysregulation may persist beyond acute infection, contributing to post-viral inflammation, immune dysfunction, and susceptibility to long COVID or autoimmune-like sequelae. The interplay between IFN signaling, mitochondrial function, and lipid metabolism highlights novel therapeutic targets for immune modulation in viral infections and chronic inflammatory conditions. Understanding these immune signatures may inform precision medicine approaches in post-viral syndromes and immunometabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

To clarify how human MRN binds generic and telomeric DNA ends and can separate DNA end sensing from nuclease activities, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human MRN bound to DNA and to DNA and the telomere protection factor TRF2. MRN senses DSBs through a tight clamp-like sensing state with closed coiled-coil domains, but auto-inhibited MRE11 nuclease. NBS1 wraps around the MRE11 dimer, with NBS1s ATM recruitment motif sequestered by binding to the regulatory RAD50 S site, necessitating an allosteric switch for ATM activation. At telomeric DNA, TRF2 blocks the second S site via the iDDR motif to prevent nuclease and ATM activation. Our results provide a structural framework for topological DNA sensing and separation of sensing, signaling and processing activities of mammalian MRN.

Highlights- Human MRN senses DNA ends with an autoinhibited nuclease
- NBS1s C-terminus binds one RAD50 S site in the sensing state
- TRF2 binds MRNs second S site at telomeres

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1742422117074

In this study, we developed an aptamer (Apt343) that targets IF3N with the goal of elucidating its contribution to translation initiation. Rapid kinetics assays revealed that Apt343 reduces the rate of IF3 association with the 30S ribosomal subunit by 13-fold, while inducing a pronounced rearrangement of both IF3 domains on the 30S. These changes compromise IF2-, mRNA-, and fMet-tRNAfMet-dependent movements of IF3, delaying 30S initiation complex (30S IC) formation by up to two orders of magnitude. Cryo-EM analysis suggests that Apt343 may sterically clash with fMet-tRNAfMet, thereby perturbing the canonical pathway by which the initiator tRNA is accommodated after IF2-dependent recruitment and prior to start codon decoding. However, once the 30S IC is formed, blocking IF3N does not prevent 50S subunit joining or 70S IC assembly. Collectively, these findings support a role for IF3N in enhancing an efficient path for fMet-tRNAfMet accommodation towards the 30S IC and promoting IF3C displacement to unlock 50S recruitment. Moreover, this aptamer-based strategy offers a valuable tool for dissecting domain-specific activities of multidomain factors within complex environments such as the initiating ribosome.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

Traditional models attribute this generalization to gradual statistical learning in the neocortex. However, such a slow process cannot account for animals' rapid generalization from limited experience. Here, we demonstrate that the hippocampus supports rapid generalization in mice by generating disentangled memory representations, where different aspects of experience are encoded independently. This code enabled the transfer of prior knowledge to solve new tasks. We identify specific circuit mechanisms underlying this rapid generalization. We show that the seemingly random changes in individual neuronal activity over time and across environments result from structured circuit-level processes, governed by the dynamics of local inhibition and cross-regional cell assemblies, respectively. Our findings provide computational and mechanistic insights into how the geometric structure and underlying circuit organization of hippocampal population dynamics facilitate both memory discrimination and generalization, enabling efficient and flexible learning.","NA","biorxiv",1742422117074

However, preparing inputs for the locally installed software is not always straightforward, and the results of local runs are not always presented in an ideally accessible fashion. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether the latest tools perform equivalently for all types of target. Results: ABCFold facilitates the use of AlphaFold 3, Boltz-1, and Chai-1 with a standardised input to predict atomic structures, with Boltz-1 and Chai-1 being installed on runtime (if required). MSAs can be generated internally using either the JackHMMER MSA search within AlphaFold 3, or with the MMseqs2 API. Alternatively, users can provide their own custom MSAs. This therefore allows AlphaFold 3 to be installed and run without downloading the large databases needed for JackHMMER. There are also straightforward options to use templates, including custom templates. Results from all packages are treated in a unified fashion, enabling easy comparison of results from different methods. A variety of visualisation options are available which include information on steric clashes. Availability and implementation: ABCFold is coded in Python and JavaScript.

We identified core regulators of cell identity and developed sequence-based models that revealed conserved regulatory codes. By predicting chromatin accessibility across 240 mammalian species, we reconstructed the evolutionary histories of human cis-regulatory elements, identifying sets associated with positive selection and gene expression changes, including the recent gain of THRB expression in cerebellar progenitor cells.

The N2B27 basal medium in which mouse gastruloids are cultured can either be home-made (HM-N2B27) with materials of known origin, or commercially sourced (NDiff227), where the exact formulation is unknown. In this study we examined whether these formulations resulted in significant differences in gastruloid development. Our results reveal that while both media enable the standard gastruloid elongation, HM-N2B27 results in gastruloids that start the elongation process earlier, have higher number of cells and an increased anterior domain. RNAseq analysis showed significant differences in cell fate specification, with HM-N2B27 gastruloids exhibiting higher expression of spinal cord-related genes, while NDiff227 favours mesodermal differentiation. Furthermore, differential gene enrichment analysis suggests that changes in key signalling pathways underline the differences between HM-N2B27 and NDiff227 gastruloids. These findings highlight the importance of basal media composition for gastruloid development, underscoring the need for careful media selection during in vitro engineering of stem cell-based embryo models.
