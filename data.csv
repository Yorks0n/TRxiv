Mechanical thrombectomy has become a standard treatment to remove obstructive clots, providing a unique opportunity to analyze their properties. We previously demonstrated that blood can clot into an amyloid-like form, generating fibrinaloid microclots (2 to 200 m) that are highly resistant to fibrinolysis. In this study, archived clots from eight ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion were examined, using samples stored in the Walton Centre Clot Bank in Liverpool, UK. All clots exhibited strong, heterogeneous amyloid staining, revealing a pervasive amyloid component. These findings represent a previously unreported characteristic of stroke clots, highlighting the potential for amyloid-targeted therapies to overcome their fibrinolytic resistance and providing a foundational new insight into ischaemic stroke pathophysiology and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Historically, the clinical benefits of ECT have been attributed to generating a controlled seizure; however, the underlying neurobiology is understudied and remains largely unresolved. Using optical neuroimaging to probe neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We further found that ECT stimulation pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we tested for the presence of hemodynamic signatures of post-ictal CSD using non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We found evidence that humans generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD. These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters to precisely modulate brain activity and treatment outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Previous studies suggest that older humans are more resistant to H5N1 infections due to childhood imprinting with other group 1 viruses (H1N1 and H2N2); however, the immunological basis for this is incompletely understood. Here we show that antibody titers to historical and recent H5N1 strains are highest in older individuals and correlate more strongly with year of birth than with age, consistent with immune imprinting. After vaccination with an A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 vaccine, both younger and older humans produced H5-reactive antibodies to the vaccine strain and to a clade 2.3.4.4b isolate currently circulating in cattle, with higher seroconversion rates in young children who had lower levels of antibodies before vaccination. These studies suggest that younger individuals might benefit more from vaccination than older individuals in the event of an H5N1 pandemic.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodeling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell type-specific circuits to produce psychedelics' behavioral actions. Here, we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation, and cell type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increased the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviorally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin's ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin's effects on stress-related behavior and structural plasticity. Collectively these results identify a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex as playing essential roles for psilocybin's long-term drug action.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

This ability is hypothesized to depend on sequential planning via step-by-step simulations of the future, using cognitive maps or schemas of task contingencies. However, it is still unclear if, how and where in the brain such flexible planning is enacted. In parallel, it is thought that consolidation transforms memory representations over time to promote adaptive behaviour. Here, we hypothesize that consolidation strengthens cognitive maps of task contingencies used for simulation during sequential planning. To test this, we developed a novel behavioural task and a new multivariate method for analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Using choice and reaction time data we dissociated flexible sequential planning from alternative non-sequential strategies, and identified this behaviour with robust neural markers of step-by-step simulation, localized to the anterior medial temporal lobe. Retesting a week later we showed that consolidation enhanced sequential planning and strengthened markers of sequential simulation in the prefrontal cortex, consistent with systems consolidation theory. By revealing that consolidation improves future simulations for flexible planning we open up a new frontier for the investigation of the functional interactions between memory and decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of the clonal landscapes of human tissues, and their impact on cancer risk, ageing and disease, remains limited due to the challenge of detecting somatic mutations present in small numbers of cells. Here, we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing method with error rates <5 errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity enables the simultaneous detection of mutations in large numbers of clones, yielding accurate somatic mutation rates, mutational signatures and driver mutation frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 samples of blood from a twin cohort, we found an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection, with 49 genes under positive selection driving clonal expansions in the oral epithelium, over 62,000 driver mutations, and evidence of negative selection in some genes. The high number of positively selected mutations in multiple genes provides high-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites, a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how carcinogenic exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing has the potential to unveil the polyclonal landscape of any tissue, providing a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

However, how aging reshapes the translational landscape of stem cells and how these changes impact their regenerative capacity remains poorly understood. Here, we present an in vivo single-cell ribosome profiling strategy to monitor tissue-wide translational landscapes of the young and aged mouse epidermis. By implementing ribosomal elongation-inhibited cell isolation and switching to RNase I ribonuclease for generating ribosomal footprints, we expand the applicability of single-cell ribosome profiling to in vivo systems and facilitate the evaluation of triplet periodicity, a hallmark of high-quality ribosome profiling data. Leveraging this strategy and integrating ribosome profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing, we document the in vivo translational landscapes of the major epidermal cell types, outline cell-type-specific translational efficiencies and capture heterogeneity in differentiation commitment within stem cell populations. Notably, we identify a pronounced translational reprogramming of AP-1 subunits specifically in aged epidermal stem cells, with functional consequences for keratinocyte behavior. Our study illustrates the power of in vivo single-cell ribosome profiling to map cell-type-specific translational programs and offers a scalable strategy for tissue-wide interrogation of translational landscapes at single-cell resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis is known to increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders. Until recently, characterising the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Using the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq, we sequenced 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24 to 75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% CI = 1.41-1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome, driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified over 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 novel) under significant positive selection in the male germline, implicating both activating and loss-of-function mechanisms and diverse cellular pathways. Most positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, while four genes that exhibit elevated frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We find that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2-3 fold elevated risk of known disease-causing mutations in sperm, resulting in 3-5% of sperm from middle-aged to elderly individuals carrying a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on the dynamics of germline mutations and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

Here, we show that pachytene piRNAs regulate targets predominantly, if not exclusively, by endonucleolytic cleavage. Remarkably, pachytene piRNAs slice hundreds of RNAs, yet a change in steady-state level is detectable for a small fraction of transcripts. Our data suggest that cleavage of the few targets whose abundance is reduced significantly by piRNAs is essential for male fertility. Other pachytene piRNA targets are enriched for highly transcribed genes, which may explain why piRNA cleavage is often inconsequential for the steady-state abundance of targets. We propose that the retention of pachytene piRNAs throughout mammalian evolution is driven by the selective advantage conferred by a tiny minority of piRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation.

Using mathematical models incorporating age-dependent contact patterns, we quantified the role of frequent sexual interactions as opposed to community contacts in the clade Ib dynamics and found that this additional mode of transmission could explain its increased outbreak potential compared with clade Ia. As with the globally-circulating clade IIb transmitted predominantly among men who have sex with men, our findings reinforce the importance of protecting key population groups, specifically FSWs for clade Ib, in controlling ongoing mpox outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

Although its effectiveness has been estimated to range between 36-86%, the persistence of protection is still unknown.

Aims of this study is to assess the immune response one year after vaccination with MVA-BN.

MethodsObservational prospective study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. All people at high risk for mpox infection who received MVA-BN as pre-exposure prophylaxis were enrolled. People previously primed with smallpox vaccination received a single-dose course of MVA-BN, while non-primed received a two-dose course. Blood samples were collected at the time of each dose and one, six and 12 months after vaccination. MPXV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed by immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization tests, respectively. Interferon-{gamma} producing T-cell specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine was analyzed by ELISpot assay. Antibody titers at pre- and post-vaccination were compared using the Friedman tests. Mann Whitney test was used to compare antibody titers in PLWH vs PLWoH. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare T-cells specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine for intra and inter-group differences, respectively.

ResultsFifty high-risk people were included. All were men, with 94% self-reporting having sex with men. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-57), and 21 (42%) were people living with HIV (PLWH), all on antiretroviral therapy, and 71% with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 L. 25 (50%) have been primed with previous smallpox vaccination.

In non-primed people, anti-MPXV IgG titers significantly increased from T1 to T3 and, despite a slight reduction, were still higher than T1 up to T4 and then gradually decreased until T5, when 64% of sera were still reactive. MPXV-nAb titers peaked at T3 and then dropped, with 56% and 32% of sera reactive at T4 and T5, respectively. IFN-{gamma} production by MVA-BN-specific T-cells progressively rose across time, peaked at T3, and remained significantly higher than the baseline after 6 and 12 months from vaccination. A single-dose course of MVA-BN vaccination in smallpox-primed participants elicited an early increase in IgG and nAb titers, which remained significantly higher than baseline after 6 and 12 months. MPXV-nAbs were detected in 80% and 72% of vaccinees at T4 and T5, respectively. A similar improvement and maintenance were observed for the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response. No evidence for a difference in both humoral and cellular responses was found between PLWH and PLWoH in our cohort.

ConclusionsOne year after vaccination, our data showed the persistent detectability of low levels of nAb against MPXV in one-third of non-primed individuals. At the same time, humoral response was still detectable in most previously vaccinated participants. Concurrently, the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response was robust and persistent.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

It is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is endemic to some countries of West and Central Africa. A multi-country outbreak of mpox occurred in 2022, and the UK experienced rapid community transmission associated with sexual contact, mainly, but not exclusively among networks of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). In response to the outbreak in the UK, a reactive mpox vaccination programme was targeted to those most at risk. We explore the uptake and course completion of mpox vaccination in GBMSM taking part in an online survey in 2023. Findings from this community sample indicate vaccination uptake in around two-thirds of participants meeting mpox proxy eligibility criteria with high levels of course completion among all and eligible participants that were ever vaccinated. Vaccine non-offer was a barrier to uptake, as nearly a third of those eligible but unvaccinated reported never having received an mpox vaccine offer. Continued targeting of vaccination to GBMSM at highest risk of mpox at SHS, with community-support, will help facilitate equitable uptake of vaccination.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

They regulate promoter activity by directly binding cis-regulatory elements in DNA. The angiosperm Arabidopsis thaliana contains more than 1,500 annotated transcription factors, each containing a DNA-binding domain that is used to define transcription factor families. Analyzing binding motifs of 686 and the binding sites of 335 A. thaliana transcription factors as well as motifs of 92 transcription factors from other plants, we identified a constrained vocabulary of 74 conserved motifs spanning 50 families in plants. Among 21 transcription factor families, we found one core motif for all analyzed members and between 2 and 72% overlapping binding sites. Five families show conservation of the motif along phylogenetic clades. Five families including the C2H2 zinc finger family show high diversity among motifs in plants, suggesting potential for neofunctionalization of duplicated transcription factors based on the motif recognized. For conserved motifs we tested if they remained conserved since at least 450 million years ago by determining the binding motifs of 17 orthologous transcription factors from 11 families in M. polymorpha using amplified DNA affinity purification sequencing. We detected nearly identical binding motifs as predicted from the angiosperm data. Taken together, the results show a large repertoire of overlapping binding sites within a TF family and species and a high degree of binding motif conservation for at least 450 million years. The results indicate more potential for evolution in cis- rather than trans-regulatory elements.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Nevertheless the cellular and molecular regulation of larval settlement, including in Cnidaria (corals, jellyfish, sea anemones, hydroids) is not well understood. We generated and compared anterior (aboral) transcriptomes and single-cell RNA-seq datasets from the planula larvae of three cnidarian species: the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, and the scleractinian corals Astroides calycularis and Pocillopora acuta.

Among common planula aboral features were genes implicated in taurine uptake and catabolism expressed in distinct specialized cell types. In functional assays, exogenous taurine inhibited settlement of both Clytia and Astroides planulae.

The process is initiated by cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and evoke a series of early cellular responses including calcium ions (Ca2+) influx, and is conducted by the intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat receptors (NLRs) ADR1s within an EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 module. However, the underlying mechanisms linking PRR signaling to the NLRs ADR1s remain unclear. Here, we show that the Nicotiana benthamiana Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-only protein Stomatal TIR1 (STIR1) produces the immune molecule pRib-AMP, induces formation of EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 complexes, and mediates stomatal immunity. The Inhibitor of Stomatal Immunity C2-domain protein 1 (ISIC1) interacts with and constrains STIR1 function at basal condition, whereas upon pathogen infection, ISIC1 senses Ca2+ signals and de-represses STIR1 signaling. Cryo-electron microscopy structure of pathogen infection-elicited Arabidopsis AtEDS1-AtPAD4-AtADR1-L2 complex reveals the pRib-AMP binding to AtEDS1-AtPAD4 receptor and the AtADR1-L2 recognition of pRib-AMP-AtPAD4-AtEDS1 for stomatal immunity.

This bursting activity can vary across individual cells, and analyzing the differences in transcription sites can help identify key drivers of gene expression for a specific target. Scaffolding methods based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been widely used to amplify the fluorescent signal of mRNAs and sort cells based on mRNA expression levels. However, these methods are inefficient at targeting nuclear RNA, including transcription sites, due to the probes' limited accessibility through cellular compartment membranes and crosslinked proteins. Additionally, the required formaldehyde fixation interferes with downstream analysis of chromatin and protein-binding interactions. To address these challenges, a platform that integrates amplified FISH with reversible crosslinkers and allows access to the nucleus is needed. In response, we developed nuclear clampFISH (nuclampFISH). This method amplifies the fluorescent signal of mRNAs using a reversible crosslinker, enabling the sorting of cells based on nuclear RNA expression and compatible with downstream biochemical analysis. This assay demonstrates that transcriptionally active cells have more accessible chromatin for a respective gene. Notably, the tools developed are highly accessible and do not require specialized computation or equipment.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

This discrimination relies on the application of mechanical force to B cell receptor (BCR)-antigen bonds, allowing B cells to selectively disrupt low-affinity interactions while internalizing high-affinity antigens. Using DNA-based tension sensors combined with high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the magnitude, location, and timing of forces within the immune synapse are influenced by the fluidity of the antigen-presenting membrane. Transitioning antigens from a high-mobility to a low-mobility substrate significantly increases the probability and speed of antigen extraction while also improving affinity discrimination. This shift in antigen mobility also reshapes the synapse architecture, altering spatial patterns of antigen uptake. Despite these adaptations, B cells maintain consistent levels of proximal and downstream signaling pathway activation regardless of antigen mobility. They also efficiently transport internalized antigens to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-positive compartments for processing. These results demonstrate that B cells mount effective responses to antigens across diverse physical environments, though the characteristics of that environment may influence the speed and accuracy of B cell adaptation during an immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Regulation of the XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, at the metaphase-anaphase transition determines a specific redistribution from kinetochores to spindle microtubules. We show that cells modulate Stu2 kinetochore-microtubule localization by Polo-like kinase1/Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation of T866, near the Stu2 C-terminus, thereby promoting dissociation from the kinetochore Ndc80 complex. Cdk/Cdc28 likely primes Cdc5:Stu2 interaction. Cdc28 activity is also required for Stu2 nuclear import. PP2ACdc55 actively opposes Cdc5 activity on Stu2T866 during metaphase. This counter-regulation allows for switchlike redistribution of Stu2pT866 at anaphase onset when separase inhibits PP2ACdc55. Blocking Stu2T866 phosphorylation disrupts anaphase spindle progression, and we infer that PP2ACdc55 regulates the mitotic spindle by dephosphorylating Stu2 and other MAPs.

These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of metal uptake in plant roots and offer potential strategies for biofortification to enhance metal content in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Comprehensive analyses reveal that CTCF binding stability and cohesin overlap in mice and humans is regulated by species specific differences in accessibility, the presence of CTCF extended Up and Downstream binding site sequences and motifs corresponding to expressed TFs enriched at most bound sites. CTCF repositions nucleosomes asymmetrically, with linker spacing altered by accessibility, while cohesin-mediated nucleosome phasing is affected by surrounding motifs which also impact chromatin insulation. Importantly, cell type-specific transcriptional programs determine motif enrichment at CTCF bound sites, reflecting the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of individual TFs. These studies identify mechanisms underlying cell type-specific CTCF profiles, linked to local and long-range chromatin organization.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Recent work has shown that ketone bodies such as {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}-OHB), which are elevated in circulation under fasting conditions or low glycemic diets, can serve as an alternative fuel that is metabolized in the mitochondria to provide acetyl-CoA for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in some tumors. Here, we discover a non-canonical route for {beta}-OHB metabolism, in which {beta}-OHB can bypass the TCA cycle to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA for de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells. We show that {beta}-OHB-derived acetoacetate in the mitochondria can be shunted into the cytosol, where acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) and thiolase convert it into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. This alternative metabolic routing of {beta}-OHB allows it to avoid oxidation in the mitochondria and net contribute to anabolic biosynthetic processes. In cancer cells, {beta}-OHB is used for fatty acid synthesis to support cell proliferation under lipid-limited conditions in vitro and contributes to tumor growth under lipid-limited conditions induced by a calorie-restricted diet in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate that {beta}-OHB is preferentially used for fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells to support tumor growth.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Many of the specimens studied have been excavated and stored for a significant duration prior to their proteomic analysis. Human handling and storage environments therefore provide ample opportunities for protein contamination onto and into specimens of interest to palaeoproteomic studies. As such, modern protein contamination limits access to endogenous proteomes. Here, we compare five approaches of bone protein decontamination applied to a Pleistocene Equus sp. bone fragment contaminated with a modern dog salivary proteome. We find that all tested methods reduce the protein contamination, but with different efficiencies. We find that a brief bleach wash is the most effective approach in removing modern protein contamination, and that no additional damage is caused to the endogenous proteome by this treatment. Next, we apply this approach to a hominin tooth found at Khudji, a Late Pleistocene archaeological site in Tajikistan. We demonstrate that a brief bleach wash removes almost all human skin protein contamination while retaining the endogenous hominin dentine proteome. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the Khudji dentine proteome allowed determination that the specimen is likely not a Denisovan, but still leaves ambiguity between an assignment to either modern humans or Neanderthals.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Their DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) contains a B3 domain that allows base-specific interactions with Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs) in DNA target sites. Land plants encode three phylogenetically distinct ARF classes: the closely related A- and B-classes have overlapping DNA binding properties, contrasting with the different DNA-binding properties of the divergent C-class ARFs. ARF DNA-binding divergence likely occurred early in the evolution of the gene family, but the molecular determinants underlying it remain unclear. Here, we show that the B3 DNA-binding residues are deeply conserved in ARFs, and variability within these is only present in tracheophytes, correlating with greatly expanded ARF families. Using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, we confirm the essential role of conserved DNA-contacting residues for ARF function. We further show that ARF B3-AuxRE interfaces are not mutation-tolerant, suggesting low evolvability that has led to the ultra-conservation of the B3-DNA interface between ARF classes. Our data support the almost complete interchangeability between A/B-class ARF B3 by performing interspecies domain swaps, even between lineages that diverged over half a billion years ago. Our analysis further suggests that DNA-binding specificity diverged early during ARF evolution in a common streptophyte ancestor, followed by strong selection as part of a competition-based auxin response system","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

In this work, we investigate how RNA-phospholipid membrane interactions occur, by means of all-atom simulations.

Linear electron transfer (LET) supplies both metabolites, yet depending on environmental conditions, additional ATP is required which can be generated by cyclic electron transfer (CET). How the balance between LET and CET is set remains largely unknown. Ferredoxin(FD)-NADP+ reductase (FNR) has been suggested to act as the switch, channelling photosynthetic electrons to LET when it is bound to photosystem I (PSI) or CET when bound to cytochrome b6f. The essential role of FNR in LET precludes the use of a direct gene knock-out to test this hypothesis. We circumvented this problem by using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to create a chimeric form of FNR tethered to PSI via PSAF. Chimeric FNR mutants exhibited impaired photosynthetic growth relative to the wild type, and decreased LET and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under high CO2 conditions. However, higher rates of CET and increased NPQ were found in the mutants under low CO2 or low O2 conditions where CET is normally up-regulated. Thus, rather than PSI-FNR interactions promoting LET, tethering FNR to PSI promotes CET at the expense of LET and CO2 fixation.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

To enhance the depth, accuracy, and throughput of SCP for tumor analysis, we developed an automated, high-throughput pipeline that enables the analysis of 1,536 single cells in a single experiment. This approach integrates low-volume sample preparation, automated sample purification, and LC-MS analysis with the Slice-PASEF method. Integration of these methodologies into a streamlined pipeline led to a robust and reproducible identification of more than 3000 proteins per cell. We applied this pipeline to analyze tumor macrophages in a murine lung metastasis model. We identified over 1,800 proteins per cell, including key macrophage markers and ~500 differentially expressed proteins between tumor and control macrophages. PCA analysis successfully separated these populations, revealing the utility of SCP in capturing biologically relevant signals in the tumor microenvironment.

Clusters can facilitate transcription, but it remains unclear how they form. It has been suggested that clusters are seeded by the sequence-specific binding of TFs to DNA, and grow by IDR-IDR interactions that bring in more TFs. This model, however, does not explain how TFs can cluster in specific combinations. Here, we study TF clustering by quantitative imaging of Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b in zebrafish embryos. Using mutant and chimaeric TFs, we show that the formation of a TF cluster requires the DBD as well as at least one of its IDRs. In contrast with the existing model, however, IDRs are not sufficient to join a preexisting cluster. Instead, both IDR and DBD are needed. Thus, for any TF to join a cluster, motif recognition is required, which explains the specificity in cluster formation. Finally, we show that while IDRs are required to join a cluster, their amino acid sequence is interchangeable, and the DBD can confer specificity to any IDR. Taken together, our work changes the model of cluster formation and explains how specificity is achieved in the organization of transcriptional machinery in the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

While data-driven statistical and machine learning methods can identify patterns from omics data across multiple samples, they typically require a large number of samples and they often lack interpretability and alignment with existing biological knowledge. In contrast, knowledge-based network methods integrate molecular data with prior knowledge to provide results that are biologically interpretable, but they lack both a unified mathematical framework, leading to ad-hoc solutions specific to particular data types or prior knowledge, limiting their generalisability, and a common modelling interface for programmatic manipulation, restricting method extensions. Furthermore, existing methods generally cannot perform joint network inference across multiple samples or conditions, which restricts their capacity to capture shared mechanisms, making these methods more sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address these limitations, we introduce CORNETO (Constrained Optimisation for the Recovery of NETworks from Omics), a unified framework for knowledge-driven network inference. CORNETO redefines the joint inference task as a constrained optimisation problem with a penalty that induces structured sparsity, allowing for simultaneous network inference across multiple samples. The framework is highly flexible and supports a wide variety of prior knowledge networks--undirected, directed and signed graphs, as well as hypergraphs--enabling the generalisation and improvement of many network inference methods, despite their seemingly different assumptions. We demonstrate its utility by presenting novel extensions of methods for signalling, metabolism and protein-protein interactions. We show how these new methods improve the performance of traditional techniques on a diverse set of biological tasks using simulated and real data. CORNETO is available as an open-source Python package (github.com/saezlab/corneto), facilitating researchers in extending, reusing, and harmonising methods for network inference.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Hh signals are transduced via an unusual mechanism: upon agonist-induced phosphorylation, the noncanonical G protein-coupled receptor SMOOTHENED (SMO) binds the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (PKA-C) and physically blocks its enzymatic activity. By combining computational structural approaches with biochemical and functional studies, we show that SMO mimics strategies prevalent in canonical GPCR and PKA signaling complexes, despite little sequence or secondary structural homology. An intrinsically disordered region of SMO binds the PKA-C active site, resembling the PKA regulatory subunit (PKA-R) / PKA-C holoenzyme, while the SMO transmembrane domain binds a conserved PKA-C interaction hub, similar to other GPCR-effector complexes. In contrast with prevailing GPCR signal transduction models, phosphorylation of SMO promotes intramolecular electrostatic interactions that stabilize key structural elements within the SMO cytoplasmic domain, thereby remodeling it into a PKA-inhibiting conformation. Our work provides a structural mechanism for a central step in the Hh cascade and defines a paradigm for disordered GPCR domains to transmit signals intracellularly.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Using the BindingDB dataset, BALM shows strong generalization to unseen drugs, scaffolds, and targets. It excels in few-shot scenarios for targets such as USP7 and Mpro, outperforming traditional machine learning and docking methods, including AutoDock Vina. Adoption of the target-based evaluation methods proposed will allow for more stringent evaluation of machine learning-based scoring tools.

One question that arises often in data on natural populations is whether differentiation among populations on a particular trait might be caused in part by natural selection. For the past several decades, researchers have used Q_ST--F_ST approaches to compare the amount of trait differentiation among populations on one or more traits (measured by the statistic Q_ST) with differentiation on genome-wide genetic variants (measured by F_ST). Theory says that under neutrality, F_ST and Q_ST should be approximately equal in expectation, so Q_ST values much larger than F_ST are consistent with local adaptation driving subpopulations' trait values apart, and Q_ST values much smaller than F_ST are consistent with stabilizing selection on similar optima. At the same time, investigators have differed in their definitions of genome-wide F_ST (such as ""ratio of averages"" vs. ""average of ratios"" versions of F_ST) and in their definitions of the variance components in Q_ST. Here, we show that these details matter. Different versions of F_ST and Q_ST have different interpretations in terms of coalescence time, and comparing incompatible statistics can lead to elevated type I error rates, with some choices leading to type I error rates near one when the nominal rate is 5%. We conduct simulations under varying genetic architectures and forms of population structure and show how they affect the distribution of Q_ST.

Here we focus on wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the ascomycete fungus Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici (Bgt). Previous research on Bgt documented the emergence of resistance to different fungicides and identified various resistance mechanisms. Yet, the frequency, distribution, and evolutionary dynamics of fungicide resistance in Bgt populations remain largely unexplored. In this study we leveraged extensive sampling and whole-genome sequencing of Bgt populations in Europe and the Mediterranean to investigate the population genetics and molecular epidemiology of fungicide resistance towards five major fungicide classes. We analyzed gene sequences and copy number variation of eight known fungicide target genes in 415 Bgt isolates sampled between 1980 and 2023. We observed that mutations conferring resistance to various fungicides increased in frequency over time, and had distinct geographic distributions, likely due to diverse deployment of fungicides across different regions. For demethylation inhibitor fungicides we identified multiple independent events of resistance emergence with distinct mutational profiles, and we tracked their rapid spread in the last decades. Overall, we revealed the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of fungicide resistance mutations in European Bgt populations. These results underscore the potential of genomic surveillance and population genetics to enhance our understanding of fungicide resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

One way in which this requirement can be met is if each of these cognitive functions occur as part of a repeated cycle. Here, we studied the temporal evolution of large-scale cortical networks, and show that while network dynamics are stochastic, the overall ordering of their activity forms a robust cyclical pattern. This cyclical structure groups states with similar function and spectral content at specific phases of the cycle and occurs at timescales of (300-1000 ms). These results are reproduced in five large magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets. Moreover, we show that metrics that characterize the cycle strength and speed are heritable, and relate to age, cognition, and behavioural performance. These results suggest that cortical network activations are inherently cyclical, ensuring periodic activation of essential cognitive functions.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

However, even thirty years after their discovery, the evolutionary consequences of hormone-mediated maternal effects remain unclear. Using an evidence synthesis approach, we tested the extent to which an increase of prenatal maternal hormone deposition into eggs relates to fitness in wild birds (19 species, 443 effect sizes, 57 studies). Egg androgens, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormones showed an overall near-zero mean effect for both maternal and offspring fitness proxies. However, heterogeneity was high, suggesting that egg hormone effects on fitness will vary depending on context. Hormone type, offspring sex and age did not explain much of the observed variance, nor did methodological factors such as type of study or experimental design. Our heterogeneity investigation showed that differences in effect sizes were mostly driven by within-study variability and phylogenetic relationships. Our study provides the most comprehensive estimate to date of the relationship between egg hormones and fitness in vertebrates. Additionally, it identifies significant biases (e.g., taxonomic, publication) and knowledge gaps that are key to address in future research to fully understand the evolutionary relevance of maternal egg hormones.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Here, we introduce a cell type-specific resource exploring the impact of TR variation on human gene expression. Leveraging whole genome and single-cell RNA sequencing, we catalog over 1.7 million polymorphic TR loci and their associations with gene expression across more than 5 million blood-derived cells from 1,790 individuals.

Further fine-mapping uncovers 6,210 sc-eTRs as candidate causal drivers of gene expression in 21% of genes tested genome-wide. We show through colocalization that TRs are likely regulators of over 2,000 GWAS loci associated with immune-mediated and hematological traits, and further identify novel TRs warranting investigation in rare disease cohorts.

Previous cerebellar coordinate-based meta-analyses and mappings have attributed different behaviors to cerebellar subareas, but an accurate behavioral topography is lacking. Here, we show overrepresentation of superior activation foci, which may be exacerbated by historical cerebellar neglect. Unequal foci distributions render the null hypothesis of standard activation likelihood estimation unsuitable. Our new method, cerebellum-specific activation-likelihood estimation (C-SALE), finds behavioral convergence beyond baseline activation rates. It does this by testing experimental foci versus null models sampled from a data-driven, biased probability distribution of finding foci at any cerebellar location. Cerebellar mappings were made across five BrainMap task domains and thirty-five subdomains, illustrating improved specificity of the new method. Twelve of forty (sub)domains reached convergence in specific cerebellar subregions, supporting dual motor representations and placing cognition in posterior-lateral regions. Repeated subsampling revealed that whereas action, language and working memory were relatively stable, other behaviors produced unstable meta-analytic maps. Lastly, meta-analytic connectivity modeling in the same debiased framework was used to reveal coactivation networks of cerebellar behavioral clusters. In sum, we created a new method for cerebellar meta-analysis that accounts for data biases and can be flexibly adapted to any part of the brain. Our findings provide a refined understanding of cerebellar involvement in human behaviors, highlighting regions for future investigation in both basic and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Increase in circulating amino acids and lipids, in part due to adipose dysfunction, have been shown to drive obesity-mediated diseases. Similarly, elevated purines and uric acid, a degradation product of purine metabolism, are found in the bloodstream and in adipose tissue. These metabolic changes are correlated with metabolic syndrome, but little is known about the physiological effects of targeting purine biosynthesis.

MethodsTo determine the effects of purine biosynthesis on organismal health we treated mice with mizoribine, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IMPDH1/2), key enzymes in this pathway. Mice were fed either a low-fat (LFD; 13.5% kcal from fat) or a high-fat (HFD; 60% kcal from fat) diet for 30 days during drug or vehicle treatment. We ascertained the effects of mizoribine on weight gain, body composition, food intake and absorption, energy expenditure, and overall metabolic health.

ResultsMizoribine treatment prevented mice on a HFD from gaining weight, but had no effect on mice on a LFD. Body composition analysis demonstrated that mizoribine significantly reduced fat mass but did not affect lean mass. Although mizoribine had no effect on lipid absorption, food intake was reduced. Furthermore, mizoribine treatment induced adaptive thermogenesis in skeletal muscle by upregulating sarcolipin, a regulator of muscle thermogenesis. While mizoribine-treated mice exhibited less adipose tissue than controls, we did not observe lipotoxicity. Rather, mizoribine-treated mice displayed improved glucose tolerance and reduced ectopic lipid accumulation.

ConclusionsInhibiting purine biosynthesis prevents mice on a HFD from gaining weight, and improves their metabolic health, to a significant degree. We also demonstrated that the purine biosynthesis pathway plays a previously unknown role in skeletal muscle thermogenesis. A deeper mechanistic understanding of how purine biosynthesis promotes thermogenesis and decreases food intake may pave the way to new anti-obesity therapies. Crucially, given that many purine inhibitors have been FDA-approved for use in treating various conditions, our results indicate that they may benefit overweight or obese patients.

Despite their significance, the intricate properties of three-dimensional (3D) multicellular tissues are not well understood and are inadequately implemented in biomaterial engineering. To address this gap, we developed a numerical method to analyze the dynamic properties of multicellular tissues using a 3D vertex model framework. By focusing on 3D tissues composed of confluent homogeneous cells, we characterized their properties in response to various deformation magnitudes and time scales. Stress relaxation tests revealed that large deformations initially induced relaxation in the shapes of individual cells. This process is amplified by subsequent transient cell rearrangements, homogenizing cell shapes and leading to tissue fluidization. Additionally, dynamic viscoelastic analyses showed that tissues exhibited strain softening and hysteresis during large deformations. Interestingly, this strain softening originates from multicellular structures independent of cell rearrangement, while hysteresis arises from cell rearrangement. Moreover, tissues exhibit elastoplastic responses over the long term, which are well represented by the Ramberg-Osgood model. These findings highlight the characteristic properties of multicellular tissues emerging from their structures and rearrangements, especially during long-term large deformations. The developed method offers a new approach to uncover the dynamic nature of 3D tissue mechanics and could serve as a technical foundation for exploring tissue mechanics and advancing biomaterial engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

We conducted high-throughput experimental evolution on Saccharomyces cerevisiae experiencing constitutive replication stress, grown under different glucose availabilities. We found that glucose levels impact the physiology and adaptation rate of replication stress mutants. However, the genetics of adaptation show remarkable robustness across environments.

Predicting sex from adolescent brain data may offer valuable insights into how these variations shape neurodevelopment. Recently, attention has shifted toward exploring socially-identified gender, distinct from sex assigned at birth, recognizing its additional explanatory power. This study evaluates whether resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) or cortical thickness more effectively predicts sex and sex/gender alignment (the congruence between sex and gender) and investigates their interrelationship in preadolescents. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we employed machine learning to predict both sex (assigned at birth) and sex/gender alignment from rsFC and cortical thickness. rsFC predicted sex with significantly higher accuracy (86%) than cortical thickness (75%) and combining both did not improve the rsFC model's accuracy. Brain regions most effective in predicting sex belonged to association (default mode, dorsal attention, and parietal memory) and visual (visual and medial visual) networks. The rsFC sex classifier trained on sex/gender aligned youth was significantly more effective in classifying unseen youth with sex/gender alignment than in classifying unseen youth with sex/gender unalignment. In females, the degree to which their brains' rsFC matched a sex profile (female or male), was positively associated with the degree of sex/gender alignment. Lastly, neither rsFC nor cortical thickness predicted sex/gender alignment. These findings highlight rsFC's predictive power in capturing the relationship between sex and gender and the complexity of the interplay between sex, gender, and the brain's functional connectivity and neuroanatomy.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

We present a novel approach that additionally obtains coarse-grained co-linearity (""chain"") statistics. We do this without using a chaining algorithm, which would require superlinear time in the number of matches. We start with a collection of strings, avoiding the multiple-alignment step required by graph approaches. We rapidly compute multi-maximal unique matches (multi-MUMs) and identify BWT sub-runs that correspond to these multi-MUMs. From these, we select those that can be ""tunneled"", and mark these with the corresponding multi-MUM identifiers. This yields an O(r + n/d)-space index for a collection of d sequences having a length-n BWT consisting of r maximal equal-character runs. Using the index, we simultaneously compute fine-grained matching statistics and coarse-grained chain statistics in linear time with respect to query length. We found that this substantially improves classification accuracy compared to past compressed-indexing approaches and reaches the same level of accuracy as less efficient alignment-based methods.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Consequently, there is immense public interest in stimulating autophagy in people. However, progress has been hampered by the lack of techniques to measure human autophagy. As a result, several key concepts in the field, including nutritional modulation of autophagy, have yet to be validated in humans. We conducted a single arm pre-post study in 42 healthy individuals, to assess whether an acute nutritional intervention could modify autophagy in humans. Two blood samples were collected per participant: after a 12 h overnight fast and 1 h post-consumption of a high protein meal. Autophagy turnover was assessed using a physiologically relevant measure of autophagic flux in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A lysosomal inhibitor was added directly to whole blood, with the resulting build-up of autophagy marker LC3B-II designated as flux, and measured quantitatively via ELISA. Notably, consumption of a high protein meal had no impact on autophagy, with no differences between overnight fasting and postprandial autophagic flux. We observed sexual dimorphism in autophagy, with females having higher autophagic flux compared to males (p = 0.0031). Exploratory analyses revealed sex-specific correlations between autophagy, insulin and glucose signalling. Importantly, our findings show that an acute nutritional intervention (overnight fasting followed by consumption of a protein-rich meal) does not change autophagic flux in humans, highlighting the need to conduct further autophagy studies in humans.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092

We demonstrate that with only 4x long read coverage augmenting 30x short reads, we can improve SNP discovery across the genome and achieve precision and recall beyond what is possible with short reads, even at very high coverage (60x). For genotype-agnostic discovery of structural variants, we see a threefold improvement in recall while maintaining precision by using the low-coverage long reads on their own. For the more specialized scenario of genotype-aware structural variant calling, we show how combining the long and short reads in a graph-based approach results in greater performance than either technology on its own. The observed gains highlight the complementary nature of short and long read technologies: long reads help with SNP discovery by better mapping to difficult regions, and they provide better performance with long insertions and deletions (structural variants) by virtue of their length, while the larger number of short-read layers help with genotyping structural variants discovered by long reads. In this way, blend-seq offers many of the benefits of long-read pipelines without incurring the cost of high-coverage long reads.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cues that generated the prediction from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim et al. (2017) found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In the morning, participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/DG ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. Differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, the results presented here provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Yet, the identity of signals within tissue niches that control macrophage metabolism is not well understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of macrophages in early mouse wounds, we find that, rather than gene expression of canonical inflammatory or resolving polarization markers, metabolic gene expression defines distinct populations of early wound macrophages. Single-cell secretomics and transcriptomics identify inflammatory and resolving cytokines expressed by early wound macrophages, and we show that these signals drive metabolic inputs and mitochondrial metabolism in an age-dependent manner. We show that aging alters the metabolome of early wound macrophages and rewires their metabolism from mitochondria to glycolysis. We further show that macrophage-derived Chi3l3 and IGF-1 can induce metabolic inputs and mitochondrial mass/metabolism in aged and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Together, these findings reveal that macrophage-derived signals drive the mitochondrial metabolism of macrophages within early wounds in an age-dependent manner and have implications for inflammatory diseases, chronic injuries, and age-related inflammatory diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Nevertheless, a major challenge lies in the site-specific attachment of three probes to unique positions within the target protein. Here, we propose an orthogonal triple-labeling strategy that is not compromised by native, reactive amino acid functionalities. It combines genetic code expansion and biorthogonal labeling of two different non-canonical amino-acids with an enzymatic self-labeling SNAP tag.

Frontal theories argue that the PFC is necessary for consciousness, while sensory theories propose that consciousness arises from recurrent activity in the posterior cortex alone, with activity in the PFC resulting from the mere act of reporting. To resolve this dispute, we re-analysed an EEG dataset of 30 participants from a no-report inattentional blindness paradigm where faces are (un)consciously perceived. Dynamic causal modelling was used to estimate the effective connectivity between the key contended brain regions, the prefrontal and the posterior cortices. Then, a second-level parametric empirical Bayesian model was conducted to determine how connectivity was modulated by awareness and task-relevance. While an initial data-driven search could not corroborate neither sensory nor frontal theories of consciousness, a more directed hypothesis-driven analysis revealed strong evidence that both theories could explain the data, with a very slight preference for frontal theories. Specifically, a model with backward connections switched off within the posterior cortex explained awareness better (53%) than a model without backward connections from the PFC to sensory regions. Our findings provide some support for a subtle, yet crucial, contribution of the frontal cortex in consciousness, and highlight the need to revise current theories of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

In a minimizers scheme, the smallest k-mer by some predefined order is selected as the representative of a sequence window containing w consecutive k-mers, which results in overlapping windows often selecting the same k-mer. Minimizers that achieve the smallest number of selected k-mers over a random DNA sequence, termed the expected density, are desired for improved performance of high-throughput sequencing analyses. Yet, no method to date exists to generate minimizers that achieve minimum expected density. Moreover, existing selection schemes fail to achieve low density for values of k and w that are most practical for high-throughput sequencing algorithms and data structures. Here, we present GreedyMini, a novel greedy algorithm to generate minimizers with low expected density. Moreover, we present innovative techniques to transform minimizers from binary to larger alphabets and to larger k values, an extension of GreedyMini to generate minimizers that achieve low density for a particular DNA sequence, and efficient methods to calculate the exact expected density. We combine these innovations into GreedyMini+, a novel method to generate DNA minimizers for practical values of k and w. We demonstrate over various combinations of practical k and w values that GreedyMini+ generates minimizers that achieve expected densities very close to a recent theoretical lower bound, and both expected and particular densities much lower compared to existing selection schemes.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT4 have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Their potential extends beyond simple language tasks, offering transformative possibilities in scientific research of all fields. By leveraging vast amounts of data and advanced computational power, LLMs can assist researchers in generating novel ideas, automating routine tasks, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. On September 12, 2024, OpenAI released their updated generative artificial intelligence system called ChatGPTo1. This new AI system, built upon chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning, has greatly enhanced logical reasoning abilities and can effectively solve various complex problems from elementary-level mathematical problems to modern scientific research issues in physics, chemistry, and biology. Unlike previous LLMs in which logical reasoning and data analysis abilities are developed through training on actual data, ChatGPTo1 logical reasoning ability and capacity to generate new scientific ideas are primarily acquired through chain-of-thought processes and reinforcement learning rather than pre-training. To examine this, we specifically tested ChatGPTo1 current reasoning and scientific discovery capabilities by developing theoretically complex and quantitatively challenging scientific equations in various fields of neuroscience, such as dynamical systems, nonlinear dynamical systems, dynamical systems on differential manifolds, neural field theory, nonlinear divergence theorems, nonlinear heat conduction equations and Laplace equations and their extensions on differential manifolds, nonlinear statistical analysis methods, deep learning, and other topics involving multiple fields. The current large language models may illustrate a certain degree of general intelligence, even if fundamentally it may be different from human intelligence. However, it does not mean the current LLMs can fully apply such ability in practical applications or that their reasoning potential can be fully tapped. It is essential to explore specific pathways and methods to cultivate their potential for scientific discovery. To accomplish this, we consider how to integrate them with common search engines (such as Google) capabilities and ChatGPT4o cross-modal abilities to better understand new disciplines and scientific discoveries. To this point, the major shortcoming of ChatGPTo1 is that it is not an end-to-end scientific discovery method and lacks the ability to achieve full automation. It also lacks methods for image analysis and full-scale data analysis, making it difficult to use simulation and data analysis to evaluate and test proposed new theories and methods.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.

To address these issues, GENCODE has undertaken the most comprehensive lncRNAs annotation effort to date. This is founded on the manual annotation of full-length targeted long-read sequencing, on matched embryonic and adult tissues, of orthologous regions in human and mouse. Altogether 17,931 novel human genes (140,268 novel transcripts) and 22,784 novel mouse genes (136,169 novel transcripts) have been added to the GENCODE catalog representing a 2-fold and 6-fold increase in transcripts, respectively - the greatest increase since the sequencing of the human genome. Novel gene annotations display evolutionary constraints, have well-formed promoter regions, and link to phenotype-associated genetic variants. They greatly enhance the functional interpretability of the human genome, as they help explain millions of previously-mapped ""orphan"" omics measurements corresponding to transcription start sites, chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding sites. Crucially, our targeted design assigned human-mouse orthologs at a rate beyond previous studies, tripling the number of human disease-associated lncRNAs with mouse orthologs.

Telomeric repeat motifs (TRMs), the minimal repeating unit of a telomere, vary from species to species, with some evolutionary clades experiencing a rapid sequence divergence. To explore the full scope of this evolutionary divergence, many bioinformatic tools have been developed to infer novel TRMs using repetitive sequence search on short sequencing reads. However, novel telomeric motifs remain unidentified in up to half of the sequencing libraries assayed with these tools. A possible reason may be that short reads, derived from extensively sheared DNA, preserve little to no positional context of the repetitive sequences assayed. On the other hand, if a sequencing read is sufficiently long, telomeric sequences must appear at either end rather than in the middle. The TeloSearchLR algorithm relies on this to help identify novel TRMs on long reads, in many cases where short-read search tools have failed. In addition, we demonstrate that TeloSearchLR can reveal unusually long telomeric motifs not maintained by telomerase, and it can also be used to anchor terminal scaffolds in new genome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

While traditional approaches using genetic screens in model organisms have uncovered some fundamental processes underlying these traits, model organisms do not possess the variation required to understand the evolution of traits with complex genetic architectures. In contrast, the advent of genomics at tree-of-life scales enables us to study the genetic interactions underlying these processes by leveraging millions of years of evolutionary trial-and-error. Here, we use the rich species diversity of the genus Myotis - one of the longest-living clades of mammals - to study the evolution of longevity-associated traits and infectious disease using functional evolutionary genomics. We generated reference genome assemblies and cell lines for 8 closely-related ([~]11 MYA) species of Myotis rich in phenotypic and life history diversity. Using genome-wide screens of positive selection, analysis of structural variation and copy number variation, and functional experiments in primary cell lines, we identify new patterns of adaptation in longevity, cancer resistance, and viral interactions both within Myotis and across bats. We find that the rapid evolution of lifespan in Myotis has some of the most significant variations in cancer risk across mammals, and demonstrate a unique DNA damage response in the long-lived M. lucifugus using primary cell culture models. Furthermore, we find evidence of abundant adaptation in response to DNA viruses, but not RNA viruses, in Myotis and other bats. This is in contrast to these patterns of adaptation in humans, which might contribute to the importance of bats as a reservoir of zoonotic viruses. Together, our results demonstrate the utility of leveraging natural variation to understand the genomics of traits with implications for human health and suggest important pleiotropic relationships between infectious disease tolerance and cancer resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

This conclusion, however, is primarily based on analyses of neural responses from macaques. Whether hierarchical variation in timescales is a general brain organizing principle across mammals remains unclear. Here we took a cross-species approach and estimated neuronal timescales of thousands of single neurons recorded across multiple areas in mice, monkeys, and humans using a task-agnostic method. We identify largely consistent hierarchies of timescales in frontal and limbic regions across species: hippocampus had the shortest timescale whereas anterior cingulate cortex had the longest. Within this scheme, variability across species was found, most notably in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. We show that variation in timescales is not simply related to differences in spiking statistics nor the result of cytoarchitectonic features such as cortical granularity. Thus, hierarchically organized timescales are a consistent organizing principle across species and appear to be related to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092
"Comparative analysis of MS/MS search algorithms in label-free shotgun proteomics for monitoring host-cell proteins using trapped ion mobility and ddaPASEF","10.1101/2024.11.03.621185","biorxiv",8.43,1.35,8.43,8.43,8.43,"Plisnier, M.; Khalil, S.","Somar Khalil","GSK","2024-11-03","1","new results","cc_by_nc_nd","biochemistry","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/11/03/2024.11.03.621185.source.xml","Host cell proteins (HCPs) are critical quality attributes that can impact the safety, efficacy, and quality of biotherapeutics. Label-free shotgun proteomics is a vital approach for HCP monitoring, yet the choice of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) search algorithms directly influences identification depth and quantification reliability. In this study, six prominent MS/MS search tools, Mascot, MaxQuant, SpectroMine, FragPipe, Byos, and PEAKS, were systematically benchmarked for their performance on complex samples spiked with isotopically labeled proteins from Chinese hamster ovary cells, using trapped ion mobility spectrometry and parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation in data-dependent acquisition mode. Key performance metrics, including peptide and protein identifications, data extraction precision, fold-change accuracy, linearity, and measurement trueness, were evaluated. A Bayesian modeling framework with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling was employed to robustly estimate fold-change means and variances, alongside local false discovery rates through posterior probability calibration. Bayesian decision theory, implemented via expected utility maximization, was used to balance accuracy against posterior uncertainty, providing a probabilistic assessment of each tools performance. Through this cumulative analysis, variability across tools was observed: some excelled in identification sensitivity and protein coverage, others in quantitative accuracy with minimal bias, and a few offered balanced performance across metrics. This study establishes a rigorous, data-driven framework for tool benchmarking, delivering insights for selecting MS/MS tools suited to HCP monitoring in biopharmaceutical development.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Here, we report the molecular mechanism underlying a DANGEROUS MIX (DM) autoimmunity, comprising DM2h/RPP1 NLR and its incompatible partner DM3, an alpha/beta hydrolase. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the oligomeric nature of two natural DM3 variants in a trimer of dimer configuration. The polymorphism triggering autoimmunity is located at the dimer interface, resulting in drastic structural differences such that dimerizing helix and loop reinforcing the interface is lost and disordered. Structure-function analysis shows that integrity of the dimer interface, but neither maintenance of hexamer nor its enzymatic activity, is the key factor contributing to autoimmunity. Our finding pinpoints checkpoints embedded in the oligomeric configuration of a host enzyme that controls the switching mechanism of NLR activity.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

We demonstrate the performance of the modified AlphaFold2, referred to as DEERFold, in switching the predicted conformations guided by experimental or simulated distance distributions. Remarkably, the intrinsic performance of AlphaFold2 substantially reduces the number and the accuracy of the widths of the distributions needed to drive conformational selection thereby increasing the experimental throughput. The blueprint of DEERFold can be generalized to other experimental methods where distance constraints can be represented by distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

The primary target of neutralizing antibodies is the fusion (F) glycoprotein on the surface of the RSV and hMPV virion. As a result of the structural conservation between RSV and hMPV F, three antigenic regions are known to induce cross-neutralizing responses: sites III, IV, and V. Leveraging LIBRA-seq, we identify five RSV/hMPV cross-reactive human antibodies. One antibody, 5-1, potently neutralizes all tested viruses from the major subgroups of RSV and hMPV and provides protection against RSV and hMPV in a mouse challenge model. Structural analysis reveals that 5-1 utilizes an uncommon genetic signature to bind an epitope that spans sites 0, II and V, defining a new mode of antibody cross-reactivity between RSV and hMPV F. These findings highlight the molecular and structural elements influencing RSV and hMPV cross-reactivity as well as the potential of antibody 5-1 for translational development.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

How cell type diversification is constrained by the stable separation between families over vast evolutionary times remains unknown. Here, integrating single-nucleus multiomic sequencing and deep learning, we show that hundreds of sequence features (motifs) divide into distinct sets associated with accessible genomes of specific cell type families. This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations. We propose that long-term stability of cell type families is maintained through genome access specified by conserved motif sets, or  vocabularies, whereas cell types diversify through flexible use of motifs within each set.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

IME has been noted across diverse genes and organisms, but remains mysterious in many respects. For example, how does intron sequence affect the magnitude of IME? In this study, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to assess the effect of varying intron sequence on gene expression in a high-throughput manner, in human cells, using tens of thousands of synthetic introns with natural splice sites and randomized internal sequence. We observe that most random introns splice efficiently and enhance gene expression as well as or better than fully natural introns. Nearly all introns stimulate gene expression [~]eight-fold above an intronless control, at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the primary mechanism acts to increase mRNA levels. IME strength is positively associated with splicing efficiency and with the intronic content of poly-uridine stretches, which we confirm using reporter experiments. Together, this work elucidates sequence determinants of IME from tens of thousands of random introns, and confirms that enhancement of gene expression is a general property of splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly polishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using Pacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly. Our pipeline introduces a method, PHARAOH (Phasing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity), which uses ultra-long ONT data to ensure alignments are accurately phased and to correctly introduce heterozygous edits in falsely homozygous regions. We demonstrate that the DeepPolisher pipeline can reduce assembly errors by half, with a greater than 70% reduction in indel errors. We have applied our DeepPolisher-based pipeline to 180 assemblies from the next Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) data release, producing an average predicted Quality Value (QV) improvement of 3.4 (54% error reduction) for the majority of the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1730758124092

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730758124092
