While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1741817305803

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1741817305803

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Despite this, only 3% of their encoded specialised metabolites have been matched to molecules and understanding how their biosynthesis is controlled is essential to fully exploit their potential. Here we use Streptomyces formicae and the formicamycin biosynthetic pathway as a model to understand the complex regulation of specialised metabolism. We analysed all three pathway-specific regulators and found that biosynthesis is subject to negative feedback and redox control via two MarR-family proteins while activation of the pathway is dependent on a cytoplasmic two-component system. Like many Streptomyces antibiotics, formicamycins are only produced in solid culture and biosynthesis is switched off in aerated liquid cultures. Here, we demonstrate that a redox-sensitive repressor named ForJ senses oxygen via a single cysteine residue that is required to repress formicamycin biosynthesis in liquid cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

In heterodichogamy, two hermaphroditic morphs exploit distinct temporal reproductive niches by alternating phases of male and female flowering, promoting disassortative mating. This system is widespread within Juglandaceae, and known to be controlled by ancient balanced polymorphisms in walnuts (Juglans) and hickories (Carya). Here we identify distinct inheritance mechanisms controlling heterodichogamy in two separate Juglandaceae genera, the wingnuts (Pterocarya and Cyclocarya). We first document the occurrence of heterodichogamy in Pterocarya and map its genomic basis to haplotypes overlapping a single candidate gene in the FANTASTIC FOUR superfamily (GFAFL). These haplotypes segregate throughout the entire genus and the dominant haplotype controls female-first flowering. We show heterodichogamy in the sister genus Cyclocarya is associated with a distinct pair of ancient haplotypes at the same locus in both diploids and tetraploids, but with a dominant allele controlling male-first flowering. We infer a well-resolved fossil-calibrated phylogeny of Juglandaceae and date the divergence of the Pterocarya and Cyclocarya haplotypes to 51 and 44 million years ago, more recent than the divergence of these genera. In Pterocarya female-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific suppression of the recessive copy of GFAFL during early male flower development. In Cyclocarya male-first heterozygotes, the dominant haplotype is associated with allele-specific activation of the recessive copy of GFAFL during male flower development, while the dominant copy itself shows higher expression in female flowers. We propose a model for the evolution of reciprocal sex matching heterodichogamy through the combination of cis-regulatory divergence and allelic interactions involving 'fast' and 'slow' alleles at a single gene regulating flowering time. The non-independent expression of alleles in both systems is reminiscent of trans-sensing phenomena in other systems and suggests a mechanism mediated by DNA homology or an RNA intermediary. Notably, the dominant haplotypes in both genera show parallel architecture with a hemizygous region containing tandem duplicates of the same 1 kb motif downstream of the transcribed region of GFAFL which may be linked with such a mechanism. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of heterodichogamy and contribute to an emerging view that diverse genetic pathways can be co-opted during its evolution and facilitate turnover in its genetic control.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

In a proof-of-principle application, we used STREAM-4D to analyze TMS-EEG and diffusion MRI tractography data in a neurotypical subject across three stimulation sites: premotor, parietal, and occipital cortex. STREAM-4D revealed extensive structural connections associated with the TMS-evoked source models, involving thalamocortical, ipsilateral cortico-cortical, and transcallosal cortico-cortical connections. Activity-weighted structural connectivity differed for the three stimulation sites but shared two extensively connected nodes: the ipsilateral thalamus and putamen.

Its therapeutic application reduces but does not abolish the progression of COVID-19 in humans. Here we report a strong synergy of Nirmatrelvir with inhibitors of the ER chaperone GRP78 (HSPA5, BiP). Combining Nirmatrelvir with the GRP78-antagonizing drug candidate HA15 strongly inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2, to a far greater extent than either drug alone, as observed by diminished cytopathic effect, levels of detectable virus RNA, TCID50 titers, accumulation of the non-structural protein 3 (NSP3), as well as Spike and N proteins. The original SARS-CoV-2 strain as well as an Omicron variant were similarly susceptible towards the drug combination. Other GRP78 inhibitors or siRNAs targeting GRP78 also fortified the antiviral effect of Nirmatrelvir. In a hamster model of COVID-19, the combination of Nirmatrelvir with HA15 alleviated pneumonia-induced pulmonary atelectasis more effectively than the single drugs. In conclusion, inhibition of the virus Main protease and cellular GRP78 cooperatively diminishes virus replication and may improve COVID-19 therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Calcium imaging is such a key method which, however, records neuronal activity only indirectly and is therefore difficult to interpret. These difficulties arise primarily from the kinetics, nonlinearity, and sensitivity of the calcium indicator, but also depend on the methods for calcium signal analysis. Here, we evaluate the ability of the recently developed calcium indicator GCaMP8 to reveal neuronal spiking, and we investigate how existing spike inference methods (CASCADE, OASIS, MLSpike) should be adapted for optimal performance. We demonstrate, both for principal cells and interneurons, that algorithms require fine-tuning to obtain optimal results with GCaMP8 data. Specifically, supervised algorithms adapted for GCaMP8 result in more linear and therefore more accurate recovery of complex spiking events. In addition, our analysis of cortical ground truth recordings shows that GCaMP8s and GCaMP8m - but not GCaMP6, GCaMP7f or GCaMP8f - are able to reliably detect isolated action potentials for realistic noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate that, due to their fast rise times, GCaMP8 indicators support shorter closed-loop latencies for real-time detection of neuronal activity. Together, our study provides demonstrations, tools, and guidelines to optimally process and quantitatively interpret calcium signals obtained with GCaMP8.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741817305803

It poses the difficult problem of continuous tracking of multiple agents, including both self and others. To understand how this tracking is implemented neurally, we examined responses of hippocampal neurons while humans performed a joystick-controlled continuous prey-pursuit task involving two simultaneously fleeing prey (and, in some cases, a predator) in a virtual open field. We found neural maps encoding the positions of all the agents. All maps were multiplexed in single neurons and were disambiguated by the use of the population coding principle of semi-orthogonal subspaces, which can facilitate cross-agent generalization. Some neurons, more common in the posterior hippocampus, had narrow tuning functions reminiscent of place cells, lower firing rates, and high information per spike; others, which were found in both anterior and posterior hippocampus, had broad tuning functions, higher firing rates, and less information per spike. Semi-orthogonalization was selectively associated with the broadly tuned neurons. These results suggest an answer to the problem of navigational individuation, that is, how mapping codes can distinguish different agents, and establish the neuronavigational foundations of pursuit.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

The GrimACE uses computer vision to provide automated mouse grimace scale (MGS) assessment together with pose estimation in a dark, safe environment. We validated the system by analysing pain after brain surgeries (craniotomies) with head implants under two analgesia regimes. Human-expert and automated MGS scores showed very high correlation (Pearson's r=0.87). Both expert and automated scores revealed that a moderate increase in pain can be detected for up to 48 hours after surgeries, but that both a single dose of meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) or 3 doses of buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg) + meloxicam (5mg/kg s.c.) provide adequate and comparable pain management. Simultaneous pose estimation demonstrated that mice receiving buprenorphine + meloxicam showed increased movement 4h after surgery, indicative of hyperactivity, a well-known side-effect of opioid treatment. Significant weight loss was also detected in the buprenorphine + meloxicam treatment group compared to the meloxicam-only group. Additionally, detailed BehaviorFlow analysis and automated MGS scoring of control animals suggests that habituation to the GrimACE system is unnecessary, and that measurements can be repeated multiple times, ensuring standardised post-operative recovery monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date.

MethodsWe conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment.

FindingsNeuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 56.5% (48/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy, a comparable rate to other AGA-associated neuropathies. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms.

InterpretationOur findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741817305803

Studies on rodents have confirmed this reduced FL is driven by a loss of sarcomeres aligned in series (serial sarcomere number; SSN) along a muscle. However, studies on rodents have focused primarily on rat plantar flexor SSN at two aging timepoints, leaving an incomplete view of age-related changes in SSN. Hence, this study investigated SSN as a contributor to the age-related loss of muscle mass in five hindlimb muscles across four aging timepoints in rats. Methods: The soleus, medial gastrocnemius (MG), plantaris, tibialis anterior (TA), and vastus lateralis (VL) were obtained from 5 young (8 months), 5 middle-aged (20 months), 5 old (32 months), and 5 very old (36 months) male F344BN rats. After fixation of muscles in formalin and digestion in nitric acid, fascicles were teased out end-to-end to measure FL. SSN was determined by dividing FL by sarcomere length measured via laser diffraction. Muscle wet weight, anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA), and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) were also determined for insight on age-related losses of whole-muscle mass and in-parallel muscle morphology. Results: Age-related SSN loss was apparent after middle age for all muscles, with the plantaris showing the smallest (8%) and the VL the greatest (21%) loss. The MG and VL appeared to plateau in their SSN loss by 32 months, while the soleus and TA underwent continued loss from 32 to 36 months. In all muscles, SSN loss evidently contributed in part to the loss of muscle mass, alongside losses of contractile tissue in parallel (indicated by ACSA and PCSA). Conclusion: As SSN is closely tied to biomechanical function, these findings present SSN as a distinct target for improving muscle performance in older adults.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

It allows differential analyses at fragment and MS1 level, recovering up to 50-fold more regulated proteins compared to a state-of-the-art approach. Using gradient boosting on tree features, we address the largely unsolved challenge of scoring quantification accuracy, as opposed to precision. Our method clusters peptides with similar quantitative behavior, providing a new approach to the protein grouping problem and enabling identification of regulated proteoforms directly from bottom-up data. Combined with deep learning classification, we infer phosphopeptides from proteome data alone, validating our findings with EGFR stimulation data. We then describe proteoform diversity across mouse tissues, revealing distinct patterns of post translational modifications and alternative splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Long thought to form exclusively homooligomeric structures, we reveal that heterooligomerization is a conserved and important feature of eukaryotic Prx1/AhpC-type peroxiredoxins. We demonstrate that heterooligomer formation modulates peroxoredoxin oligomeric state and enhances structural stability. In yeast, Tsa1-Tsa2 peroxiredoxin heterodecamers form in response to oxidative stress and incorporated Tsa2 stabilizes the decameric state. Beyond yeast, we show that human PRDX1 and PRDX2, as well as plant and parasitic peroxiredoxins, engage in functional heterooligomerization. These findings challenge the long-held paradigm of peroxiredoxin homooligomerization and reveal a novel mechanism for regulating redox homeostasis.

We demonstrate that the DFRSox2 dramatically enhances the search efficiency of Sox2 as compared to the negatively-charged DFRSox17. An enhanced search on naked DNA is primarily mediated by an increase in target recognition rate during 1D sliding.

Their fast calculation from allele frequencies allows for rapid downstream admixture graph inference. One frequently overlooked assumption of the f4-test is a constant substitution rate. This assumption is typically questionable when comparing distantly-related lineages. Using simulations, we find that rate variation across lineages decreases the accuracy of the f4-test to detect the presence of reticulations in large data sets or with high average mutation rate. But when f-statistics are combined to infer an admixture graph, rate variation across lineages has a small effect on accuracy. Network inference was accurate on a simple network with 1 reticulation only, but extremely inaccurate to infer a complex network with 4 reticulations, even from large data sets and without rate variation. Yet in both cases, the network's major tree was inferred reliably. Rate variation significantly increased the distance between the true and closest estimated network, the score gap between the true and best-scoring network, and the rate of incorrectly rejecting 1 reticulation as adequate, under our simple network. We propose that identifiability, or lack thereof, is underlying the contrasting results between our simple and complex networks. Our findings suggest that the major tree is one feature that might be identifiable from f-statistics. In practice, we recommend evaluating a large set of top-scoring networks inferred from f-statistics, and even so, using caution in assuming that the true network is part of this set when inferred networks are complex. The extent of rate variation should be assessed in the system under study, especially at deeper time scales, in systems with rapid molecular evolution or with fast-evolving loci.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Converging evidence from neuroimaging studies and genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggests the involvement of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum dysfunction in the pathophysiology of AN. However, identifying the causal role of circuit-specific genes in the development of AN-like phenotype remains challenging and requires the combination of novel molecular tools and preclinical models. The activity-based anorexia (ABA) rat model recapitulates many aspects of the behavioural phenotypes of AN in humans and we have previously demonstrated that suppressing neural activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) circuit prevented pathological weight loss in ABA rats. Here, we used a novel viral-based translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) technique to identify transcriptional changes within this neural pathway associated with susceptibility to ABA in female rats. We reveal 1424 differentially expressed genes between Susceptible and Resistant rats, highlighting important transcriptional changes associated with ABA within this pathway. The changes observed were independent of current calorie deficit and associated with metabolic, mitochondrial and neural functions. Further, we show that genes upregulated in Resistant rats were involved in mitochondrial function, while downregulated genes were associated with cytoskeletal, postsynaptic and axonal functions, supporting the hypothesis that hyperexcitability of cortico-striatal circuit function is a critical mediator of pathological weight loss in ABA. These findings provide novel insights into circuit-specific gene expression patterns that may contribute to susceptibility to developing AN in humans and highlight potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

However, the molecular mechanisms governing cell state transitions within the neo-intima in human CAD remain poorly understood, and no lipid-independent therapies are currently approved for its treatment. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell gene expression profiling, epitope mapping, and spatial transcriptomics from 27 human coronary arteries. Our analysis identified fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as a marker of modulated VSMCs within the neo-intima. Genetic lineage tracing in mice confirmed that FAP cells in the plaque originate from medial VSMCs. Additionally, non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in patients with CAD revealed focal FAP uptake in atherosclerotic lesions. Spatial transcriptomics further delineated the distinct localization of VSMC and immune cell subsets within plaques, with FAP states enriched in the neo-intima. To explore the therapeutic potential of targeting de-differentiated VSMCs, we developed an anti-FAP bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) and demonstrated that it significantly reduced the plaque burden in multiple mouse models of atherosclerosis. Collectively, our study provides the first single-cell and spatially resolved map of human CAD, establishes FAP as a marker of modulated smooth muscle cells, and demonstrates the broader potential of immunotherapeutics for lipid independent targets in atherosclerotic CAD.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

We propose using anticlustering as an automated method to assign samples to balanced batches. Anticlustering effectively negates differences in (numeric and/or categorical) covariates among batches, and implements user-defined restrictions on the number of batches, the number of samples per batch, and whether to assign certain samples to the same batch (""must-link constraints""). A simulation study shows that anticlustering is better at achieving balance among batches than previous approaches. An application from the UCSF-Stanford Endometriosis Center for Discovery, Innovation, Training and Community Engagement (""ENACT"", https://enactcenter.org/) is presented as a real-life example. In the application, multiple samples provided by an individual had to be processed on the same batch, so that comparisons among different samples of the same patient were not diluted by batch effects.

ACLY-deficient NK cells upon IL-15 activation exhibited significant defects in glycolysis, proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity, without decreased intracellular lipids. Notably, ACLY-deficiency specifically resulted in reduced NK cell responses to activating receptors associated with the adapter proteins DAP10 or DAP12. This is due to decreased DAP12 and increased DAP10 transcript and protein, coupled with epigenetic profiling that demonstrated altered histone acetylation of these genes in ACLY KO.

These broken ends are efficiently resolved by homologous recombination to yield D-loops and erroneous end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, DNA synthesis downstream of an seDSB is highly inefficient. In contrast, when two forks converge at an SSB, they generate a double-ended DSB (deDSB) that efficiently completes DNA synthesis through double-strand break repair that is not dependent on homologous recombination. Leading, but not lagging, seDSBs can undergo extensive nucleolytic degradation that disassembles the divergent fork. These  secondary collapse events efficiently resolve seDSBs but without completion of DNA synthesis. Moreover, PARP inhibition can enhance fork collapse at unmodified SSBs but not at abasic site SSBs, contrary to expectations. Our findings distinguish end resolution from replication completion and demonstrate flexibility in how PARP inhibition affects fork collapse.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

However, platform heterogeneity, batch effects, and the lack of unified methods for single- and multi-omics analyses represent relevant drawbacks that hinder the extrapolation of a meaningful biological interpretation. Statistical meta-analysis is widely used in order to integrate several omics datasets of the same type, leading to the extrapolation of robust molecular signatures within the investigated system. Conversely, statistical meta-analysis does not allow the simultaneous investigation of different molecular layers, and, therefore, the integration of multi-modal data deriving from multi-omics experiments. Although in the last few years a number of valid tools designed for multi-omics data integration have emerged, they have never been combined with statistical meta-analysis tools in a unique analytical solution in order to support meaningful biological interpretation. Network science is at the forefront of systems biology, where the inference of molecular interactomes allowed the investigation of perturbed biological systems, by shedding light on the disrupted relationships that keep the homeostasis of complex systems.

In vivo crosslinking is a powerful tool for probing these interactions, with photoactivatable amino acids representing a promising next step. Here, we evaluated the application of photo-leucine in the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. This amino acid analog is incorporated into proteins, but high concentrations inhibit the growth of B. subtilis. We investigated photo-leucine homeostasis and identified the branched-chain amino acid importers BcaP and BraB as well as the bipartite exporter AzlCD as key players of its uptake and export, respectively. Additionally, we identified a previously uncharacterized exporter, AexB, a member of the ""sleeping beauty"" group of EamA amino acid exporters. Expression of the aexB gene is positively regulated by the transcription factor AerB, that is normally normally inactive. Selective pressure by photo-leucine triggered the acqusition of a point mutation in aerB, allowing AerB to activate aexB expression. Mutants highly resistant to photo-leucine carried a single amino acid exchange, Ala-494 to Thr, in the leucine-tRNA synthetase LeuS. Molecular docking analysis revealed that this mutation alters the leucine-binding pocket, in a manner that still allowed binding of leucine, but not photo-leucine. While high photo-leucine incorporation is beneficial for effective crosslinking, our results suggest that B. subtilis intrinsically limits its incorporation to maintain cellular tolerance. Thus, evolutionary processes provide adaptive mechanisms to adjust amino acid analogue incorporation to tolerable levels, making photo amino acids a candidate for life cell investigation of protein struture and interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Importantly, we subsequently found that the PQQAR mutant is transmitted in the direct contact hamster model despite lacking an intact FCS. However, competition transmission showed that the mutant was attenuated compared to WT SARS-CoV-2. Together, the data argue that the FCS is required for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis but is not strictly required for viral transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Historically, their conformational states have been defined by the DFG motif: DFG-in and DFG-out. However, this binary paradigm overlooks the broader conformational heterogeneity of apo STKs, which encompasses multiple metastable states within an expanded DFG-Phe ensemble. We introduced a novel nomenclature that integrates the dynamics of the DFG-Phe, activation loop, and C-helix, highlighting how these regions respond to various ensemble perturbations (e.g., mutations, ligand binding, and protein-protein interactions). A major bottleneck in studying kinases lies in sampling their wide-ranging conformations because static snapshots often remain trapped in specific free energy minima, limiting traditional molecular dynamics simulations from exploring multiple functionally relevant states starting from a single structure. To accelerate conformational sampling, we introduce a computational framework that integrates AlphaFold, machine learning, physics-based simulations, and Markov state modeling. Rather than focusing on single-structure snapshots or structural hypotheses generated by protein structure prediction models, our framework captures shifts in conformational populations under varying perturbations, shedding light on both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the transitions. A key innovation lies in our machine learning algorithms, which capture slowly varying structural features to uncover hidden states and generate latent representations of conformational motions across different kinase domains. The physics-refined structural ensemble sampled from the latent layers is then used to launch new simulations that more comprehensively explore the full conformational landscape than traditional molecular simulation approaches. By capturing how these conformational shifts influence downstream protein-protein interactions, conformational allostery, and cryptic pocket formation, our accelerated simulation framework provides deeper insights into STK mechanisms and enables the development of new therapeutic modalities. Finally, by uniting our comprehensive conformational definition with an AI-accelerated molecular simulation strategy, we capture generalized conformational dynamics in kinases and how their heterogeneity is influenced by ensemble-level perturbations. This framework can be extended to investigate broader protein families--such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and tumor necrosis factors (TNFs)--where functional outcomes are dictated by conformational heterogeneity.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

To go much beyond this number, smaller and simpler genetic systems are needed to avoid significant technical challenges. Chloroplast genomes offer multiple advantages for codon compression and reassignment. Here we report a recoding scheme for the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplast genome, in which two stop codons and one or more of the codons for arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine and serine, all of which have two cognate tRNAs, are absent, compressing the genetic code to 51 codons. Firstly, several recoding strategies were tested on the essential rpoA gene, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast RNA polymerase. A defined compression scheme, which relied on swapping the target codons with the permitted frequent codons, could replace the native protein coding sequence without affecting chloroplast protein expression levels or the strain fitness. The same strategy was successfully used for codon compression of ycf1, encoding a subunit of the chloroplast translocon, psaA and psbA, intron-containing highly expressed genes encoding reaction centres subunits of both photosystems, and an 8.5 kb operon encoding essential and non-essential genes. Finally, we tested degeneracy of the 51-codon genetic code by exploring the combinatorial design for the large subunit of RuBisCO, relying on restoration of photosynthesis in an rbcL mutant strain. More than 70 functional sequences with diverse codon adaptation indices were recovered. In all codon-compressed genes there was no observable penalty on photosynthetic growth.

Significance StatementWe demonstrate the use of a chloroplast genome as a synthetic biology platform to test modifications of the universal genetic code. Elimination of 13 of the 64 possible triplet codes (codons) was possible for several essential and/or highly expressed genes without affecting chloroplast function. The technology is mature, paving the way for codon compression of the entire genome and thus enabling further radical rearrangement or expansion of the genetic code.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

For example, Jurkat leukemic T cells fundamentally contributed to uncovering T cell signaling, activation, and immune responses. However, the immortalization process can alter key cellular properties, and researchers widely believe this process could significantly change RNA modification machinery and modification sites. In this study, we focus on pseudouridine ({Psi}), one of the most abundant mRNA modifications, and compare {Psi} profiles in mRNA from primary and immortalized T cells using direct RNA sequencing (DRS). Surprisingly, 87% of {Psi}-sites were shared between the two cell types, primarily in transcripts encoding proteins involved in essential cellular processes, including RNA-modification regulation. Furthermore, the analysis of the 13% of sites unique to each cell type reveals that Jurkat cells contained transcripts linked to immune activation and oncogenesis, while primary T cells contained transcripts associated with calcium signaling and intracellular trafficking. We provide a list of these genes, which should be considered when using immortalized cells to study RNA modifications in immunology contexts. Most differences were driven by whether the mRNA was present or absent in the immortalized or primary cell type. Interestingly, RNA-modification enzyme expression levels were highly conserved in both cell types. This suggests that site-specific differences in {Psi} levels arise from regulatory processes acting in trans rather than differences in modification enzyme levels.

Significance StatementIt is widely believed that RNA modification machinery and modification sites could be significantly altered in immortalized cells, yet this has never been tested. Focusing on pseudouridine ({Psi}), we map {Psi} in the transcriptomes of primary and immortalized human T cells. Surprisingly, most sites are conserved in the primary and immortalized T cells, with several important examples of cases with cell type specificity and should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, we evaluated RNA-modification machinery levels in primary and immortalized T cells, finding high conservation across the cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that RNA modifications are largely conserved between primary and immortalized cells, and the edge cases can be considered individually.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

In these conditions, fibrotic tissues are characterized by the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and pro-fibrotic myofibroblasts. However, the role of CD8+ T cells in driving myofibroblast activity remains unexplored. Our aim was to investigate this interaction between CD8+ T cells and skin myofibroblasts and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.

MethodsPrimary skin-derived myofibroblasts were co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or sorted T cells in a 3D collagen type I hydrogel. To model autoimmunity, allogeneic mismatching was applied. T cell activation and cytokine expression were assessed using flow cytometry and Luminex. Myofibroblast activation was analysed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), while activation-induced contraction was measured macroscopically. Intracellular signalling pathway activation in myofibroblasts was evaluated using luciferase reporter cell lines.

ResultsCo-culture of myofibroblasts with PBMCs strongly induced hydrogel contraction and expression of activation-related markers such as podoplanin, fibroblast activation protein, pSTAT3 and IL-6 in myofibroblasts. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were also activated by co-culture as identified by increased CD25 and CD69 expression and elevated IL-2 and IFN-{gamma} production. Upon co-culture with either sorted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CD8+ T cells more strongly induced myofibroblast contraction and activation than CD4+ T cells. This was not associated with cytotoxicity but with increased IL-6 production by CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells and STAT3/TGF{beta}-induced signaling in myofibroblasts. Use of either the JAK/STAT3-inhibitor tofacitinib or the TGF{beta} receptor inhibitor SB-505124 blocked the activated myofibroblast phenotype, and combined use of both inhibitors had an additive effect on myofibroblast activation and contraction.

ConclusionsCD8+ T cells drive primary skin derived myofibroblast contraction and activation not via cytotoxicity-related program but via cytokine release. This sheds light on novel mechanisms of immune cell mediated tissue fibrosis. Furthermore, our results suggest that combining JAK/STAT inhibition with an anti-fibrotic agent that blocks matrix synthesis might be promising in mitigating immune cell mediated tissue fibrosis in connective tissue rheumatic disorders and has added value over blocking these pathways individually.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

Specialized villus lymphatic capillaries, lacteals, undergo constant VEGF-C-dependent renewal to maintain their function in a hyperosmolar, inflammatory microenvironment exposed to dietary by-products. The mechanisms of lacteal adaptation remain incompletely understood. We integrated new and published single-cell RNA-sequencing data to profile murine small-intestinal lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and identified three distinct subsets. Lacteal LECs display a transcriptional signature resembling Ptx3 immune-interacting LECs characterized by high expression of Aqp1, encoding the aquaporin-1 water channel. LEC-specific deletion of Aqp1 reduced lacteal length, impaired lipid uptake, and limited weight gain on a high-fat diet, underscoring the importance of water homeostasis in lacteal maintenance. AQP1 also promoted VEGF-C-dependent LEC migration under osmotic stress and, uniquely, was upregulated during inflammatory remodelling in secondary lymphedema and lymphatic malformations, but not during embryonic lymphangiogenesis. These findings link lacteal regeneration to inflammatory lymphatic remodelling and highlight tissue osmolarity as a key biophysical factor in postnatal lymphangiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803

We propose that affinity-enhancing SHMs are selectively enriched in public antibody clonotypes, surpassing the background frequency seen in antibodies carrying the same V genes, but with different epitope specificities. Employing a human IGHV4-59/IGKV3-20 public antibody as a model, we compare SHM signatures in antibodies also using these V genes, but recognizing other epitopes. Critically, this comparison identified clonotype-enriched mutations in the light chain. Our analyses also show that these SHMs, in combination, enhance binding to a previously uncharacterized viral epitope, with antibody responses to it increasing after multiple vaccinations. Our findings offer a framework for identifying affinity-enhancing SHMs in public antibodies based on convergence and clonotype-enrichment and can help guide vaccine design aimed to elicit public antibodies.","NA","biorxiv",1741817305803
