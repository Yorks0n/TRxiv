While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704945

OMEGA computationally fragments target genes into short, high-fidelity Golden Gate-compatible oligonucleotides that can be ordered as a pooled library and assembled across multiplexed subpools. We systematically optimized the number of fragments per gene and orthogonal ligation sites per reaction and determine that OMEGA can assemble up to 2.6 kb constructs using as many as 70 Golden Gate sites. To validate the approach, we assembled and functionally screened a library of 810 natural and synthetic GFP variants, recovering 94-97% of target sequences with high uniformity.

Traditional methods based on sequence homology and statistical models often struggle with complex genetic variations and novel sequences due to their limited ability to interpret the ""language of genes."" To overcome these challenges, we explore Genomic Language Models (gLMs) -inspired by Large Language Models in Natural Language Processing- to enhance bacterial gene prediction. These models learn patterns and contextual dependencies within genetic sequences, similar to how LLMs process human language. We employ transformers, specifically DNABERT, for bacterial gene prediction using a two-stage framework: first, identifying Coding Sequence (CDS) regions, and then refining predictions by identifying the correct Translation Initiation Sites (TIS). DNABERT is fine-tuned on a curated set of NCBI complete bacterial genomes using a k-mer tokenizer for sequence processing. Our results show that GeneLM significantly improves gene prediction accuracy. Compared to Prodigal, a leading prokaryotic gene finder, GeneLM reduces missed CDS predictions while increasing matched annotations. More notably, our TIS predictions surpass traditional methods when tested against experimentally verified sites. GeneLM demonstrates the power of gLMs in decoding genetic information, achieving state-of-the-art performance in bacterial genome analysis. This advancement highlights the potential of language models to revolutionize genome annotation, outperforming conventional tools and enabling more precise genetic insights.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704945

Centrioles and cilia are dispensable in 3D in vitro mouse rosettes, mimicking key events of implantation, including polarization and lumenogenesis. In gastruloids, a model system that recapitulates developmental processes up to E8.5, centriole loss results in early disassembly. In contrast, cells devoid of cilia continue to form elongated, differentiated and polarized gastruloids, with minor differences at 96 h.

Metatranscriptomic analyses suggest viral functional genes are actively expressed, potentially enhancing host metabolism of complex organic matter (COM). Indeed, purified viruses from deep-sea sediments were shown to facilitate COM metabolism in certain deep-sea microorganisms, enabling the isolation of previously uncultured bacterial taxa. Notably, in these newly isolated bacteria, polysaccharides induced chronic virus release without cell lysis, a process that may assist host metabolism of polysaccharides.

Objective To evaluate the association of PI-RADS with prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), overall survival (OS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and biochemical recurrence (BCR) across multiple cohorts. Design, Setting, Participants A retrospective registry cohort was collected from Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) for men with clinical suspicion of PCa. HUS cohort included 4,674 men who underwent diagnostic MRI during the PI-RADS version 2 era (2015-2019, median follow-up [mFU] 5.0 years). Validation cohorts were gathered from Tampere University Hospital (n=1,474, 2016-2021, mFU 2.2 years) and Lille University Hospital (N=301, 2016-2024, mFU 6.2 years).

The MEEGNet pipeline also integrates latent space visualization tools, adapted for MEG and EEG data. These include saliency maps and Grad-CAM methods, which enhance the interpretability of ANN-based classification and help address the black-box critique of such models. Importantly, the MEEGNet library is designed for extensibility, allowing the neuroscience and machine learning communities to add functionalities and ANN models.

Through comprehensive in vitro, and in silico analyses, we identified that SB431542 directly binds to SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and disrupt its canonical function in inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. This restored lysosomal acidification and normalized perinuclear LAMP-1 localization, significantly impairing virion assembly as evidenced by disrupted nucleocapsid-RNA association and reduced intracellular viral titers. Additionally, SB431542 downregulated the CLEAR network genes responsible for lysosomal biogenesis, further restricting viral egress pathways. Our temporal analyses revealed that at later infection stages (36-48 hpi), SARS-CoV-2 exploits TGF-{beta}-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and apoptosis for viral release--processes effectively inhibited by SB431542 through suppression of GADD45b and BAX expression. These multiple mechanisms resulted in an exceptional EC50 of 515 nM against SARS-CoV-2. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in embryonated chicken eggs, where SB431542 conferred dose-dependent protection against lethal infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) challenge, with a favourable therapeutic index of 34.54. Remarkably, sequential passaging of SARS-CoV-2 for 50 generations under SB431542 selection pressure failed to generate resistant variants, contrasting sharply with the rapid resistance emergence typical of direct-acting antivirals. These findings establish SB431542 as a promising broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor with a unique triple-mechanism approach that simultaneously targets viral entry via TGF-{beta}/Smad modulation, disrupts ORF3a-mediated lysosomal dysfunction affecting assembly, and attenuates TGF-{beta}-induced apoptosis during late-stage infection--collectively imposing multiple selective constraints that impede escape mutation development.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

In this study, we generated a comprehensive and curated TE library for the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) by integrating two bioinformatic pipelines (EDTA and DeepTE). Our annotation revealed that TEs account for approximately 37% of the F. vesca genome. Analysis of TE-derived inverted repeats (IRs) and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) demonstrated their association with 24-nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) production and differential DNA methylation patterns across tissues, suggesting a role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, particularly during fruit ripening. This MITE-mediated epigenetic regulatory mechanism was confirmed by evaluating gene expression and chromatin organization at FvH4_7g18570, which encodes the alcohol acyl transferase (FvAAT1). Three MITEs located upstream or downstream of the FvAAT1 coding sequence were shown to influence epigenetically this gene expression. Furthermore, we analyzed 210 re-sequenced accessions from the F. vesca European germplasm collection to identify and annotate TE insertion and deletion polymorphisms. A principal component analysis (PCA) based on these polymorphisms revealed subpopulation structures that reflect geographic origins. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) uncovered significant associations between specific TE polymorphisms and economically important fruit traits, including aroma-related volatile compounds and fruit size. Among them, the insertion of a hAT MITE near FvH4_2g00610 correlated with increased levels of {gamma}-decalactone, a desirable aroma compound in strawberries. These findings underscore the functional significance of TE-derived elements as key contributors to phenotypic diversity through novel regulatory functions.

Virulence in Staphylococcus aureus is driven by the production of virulence factors that facilitate nutrient acquisition and promote immune evasion and subversion. One key virulence regulatory system is the Sae two-component system (TCS), which upregulates the production of various virulence factors. The sensor histidine kinase SaeS, a member of the intramembrane family of histidine kinases (IM-HKs), lacks a signal-binding domain, leaving the mechanisms by which these HKs sense signals and regulate gene expression unclear. We report that de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is essential for maintaining Sae activity. Disruption of genes involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis reduces Sae-dependent promoter activity under pyrimidine-limited conditions. Phos-tag electrophoresis confirmed that pyrimidine limitation impacts SaeS kinase activity. The effect of pyrimidine limitation on SaeS was abrogated in a strain producing only the catalytic domain, suggesting that pyrimidines regulate SaeS activity at the membrane. Additionally, defective pyrimidine biosynthesis caused membrane defects and increased incorporation of free fatty acids into the membrane. Further, providing an extracellular sink for free fatty acids restored Sae activity in these mutants.

Here, we identify four heterodimeric complexes responsible for chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization in humans: CHSY1-CHPF, CHSY1-CHPF2, CHSY3-CHPF and CHSY3-CHPF2. Using a novel in vitro glycosylation assay based on chemo-enzymatically synthesized fluorescent substrates, we demonstrate that all four complexes exhibit chain polymerization activity. The cryo-EM structure of the CHSY3-CHPF complex provides, for the first time, molecular insights into the chondroitin sulfate chain polymerization reaction. The architecture of the catalytic sites suggests that CHSY1 and CHSY3 are enzymatically active, while CHPF and CHPF2 primarily play a stabilizing role. Mutational analysis of purified enzyme complexes, combined with an in cellulo complementation assay, confirms that only CHSY1 and CHSY3 have bifunctional glycosyltransferase activities. Based on the spatial arrangement of the catalytic sites, we propose that chondroitin sulfates chain polymerization follows a non-processive, disruptive mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

The mandible adductor muscles occupy most of the head's internal volume, and their contraction generates forces that could risk cuticle failure. Here we quantified ant worker plane head shape disparity and explored how it influences stress dissipation under biting conditions. We combined a geometric morphometric approach under a phylogenetic comparative framework and biomechanical simulations to test the hypothesis that idealized head shapes poorly explored by current ant lineages exhibit biomechanical limitations that could be negatively selected, while an idealized shape representing the median ant worker head shape would present a superior mechanical performance. Our results revealed that narrow heads with deep vertex depressions distribute stresses more evenly, but usually at high levels. Broader heads with convex posterior margins, in contrast, concentrate stresses around the mandibular articulations, making them more prone to failure under high bite forces. Most ant lineages exhibit a head shape that allows mild stresses to spread along the head while concentrating higher stresses around the mandibular articulations. This evolutionary pattern results in a limited morphospace occupation, with most ants clustering around a typical shape and only a few lineages exploring extreme morphologies.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Traditionally, Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) groups have contributed to the design of clinical research but less often to the analysis and reporting of findings. This study is wholly led by a patient group with no direct input from clinicians, thus presenting an entirely novel and unique patient-centric view. Methods: This report draws on data from a Wellbeing Survey led by the Edinburgh IBD Science team as part of the MUSIC IBD cohort study (www.musiscstudy.uk) with over 1375 IBD respondents over two time periods in 2023 from United Kingdom. The PPI group utilised high-level topic analysis and their own lived experience of IBD to explore the 415 free-text survey responses. Regular discussions allowed the team to reflect on patient narratives and generate findings collaboratively. PPI members contributed to both the structure and content of the final write-up, utilising their diverse backgrounds and skillsets. Results: The analysis provided in-depth exploration of several key themes affecting wellbeing in IBD patients. Of interest, the PPI group discussed and explored themes such as 'what does remission mean?', access to care, expectations of self-management, mental and women's health. The patient narratives highlighted the variability of IBD experiences, the interconnectedness of these issues, and the importance of holistic, patient-centric approaches to care. The findings emphasise the necessity for improved support, both within and beyond healthcare settings. Conclusion: This patient-led research approach demonstrates that allowing patients to lead in analysis ('taking the reins') and reporting provides deeper and impactful insights into IBD experiences. By integrating patient perspectives, this study advocates for a patient-dominant approach to research and care, which can improve outcomes and support ways to address the complexities of living with IBD. The model highlights challenges and benefits of this approach, serving as a foundational template for future patient-led collaborations, in addition to the immediate impact of patients' wellbeing from shared experiences, to educating clinicians and people without IBD about the impact of IBD on patients' lives.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704946

We estimated the genetic relationship among 370,259 Danes using Danish healthcare registries and validated those with retrievable pedigree relationships from a national family registry. We also compared their IBD sharing with 488,376 British individuals from the UK Biobank.

Our analysis revealed the fine-grained population genetic history of Denmark and identified distinct coastal and island communities with a history of genetic isolation and bottlenecks. We observed a significant population decline in Jutland compared to Zealand during the late medieval period to the start of early modern period, accompanied by migration from Jutland to Zealand, corresponding to historical evidence.

We identified two major IBD sharing patterns between Denmark and Great Britain: early coast-to-coast connections between South Jutland and eastern England, likely driven by Viking settlements, continuous trade and people movements across the North Sea from the Middle Ages through early modern times, and later city-to-city connections such as those between London and Kobenhavn likely influenced by urbanisation and Industrial Revolution. Further comparisons using other North Sea countries showed both shared and unique histories of genetic exchange with Denmark and Britain.

Our study provides novel genetic evidence of migration across the North Sea from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. It highlights the power of nationwide biobanks in reconstructing fine-scale historical population movements among closely related populations.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

There is a need to better understand obesity subtypes and to develop approaches for stratification. In this study we investigated both metabolomic and proteomic signatures in serum and blood plasma samples discriminating metabolically healthy from unhealthy obesity.

MethodsWe investigated cross-sectional metabolomic and proteomic data from participants of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. Participants were grouped into metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) based on available health data in the study. A total of 461 individuals were included in the analysis, with n=130 MHO and n=331 MUO. Random forest (RF) classifiers were used to discriminate metabolically healthy from unhealthy obesity and to identify molecular features characteristic of MHO/MUO. Linear regression models were used to assess associations between each relevant metabolite/protein and MHO/MUO phenotypes independently of age, sex and body composition.

ResultsThe MHO/MUO RF classifier achieved a performance of AUC = 0.709, 95% CI = (0.698,0.721). Three plasma proteins and 12 circulating metabolites were identified as relevant predictors of MHO/MUO phenotypes. Linear regression models confirmed the Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) association to be independent of age, visceral fat composition, medication or serum triglyceride levels.

ConclusionAPOC3 was identified as a novel predictor for obesity stratification, highlighting the importance of circulating triglyceride levels in relation to metabolic health.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704946

The aim of this study was to elucidate the architecture of this region and the way in which it is presented to antibodies.

Isolated anti-1147 antibodies interacted with it regardless of how the peptide was presented, be that freely exposed via the N-terminus, organized as a pseudocycle, or adsorbed on the surface. MDS showed that peptide 1147 is capable of closely approaching the membrane. Analysis of the surface properties of peptide 1147 in membrane-bound states and in available conformations in the full-sized S protein reveals interface for interaction with antibodies. Interestingly, the latter bears similarities to one published peptide-antibody complex. However, these antibodies, in spite of their high diagnostic significance, show no virus-neutralizing activity, indicating that peptide 1147 has no therapeutic value as a synthetic vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Genetically encoded oscillators (GEOs) built from bacterial MinDE-family ATPase and Activator modules generate fast orthogonal protein waves in eukaryotic cells, providing an experimental model system for genetic and biochemical coordination of synthetic protein dynamics. Here, we use budding yeast to experimentally define and model phase portraits that reveal how the breadth of frequencies and amplitudes available to a GEO are genetically controlled by ATPase and Activator expression levels and noise. GEO amplitude is encoded by ATPase absolute abundance, making it sensitive to extrinsic noise on a population level. In contrast, GEO frequency is remarkably stable because it is controlled by the Activator:ATPase ratio and thus affected primarily by intrinsic noise. These features facilitate noise-guided design of different expression strategies that act as filters on GEO waveform, enabling us to construct clonal populations that oscillate at different frequencies as well as independently tune frequency and amplitude variation within a single population. By characterizing 169 biochemically distinct GEOs, we provide a rich assortment of phase portraits as starting points for application of our waveform engineering approach. Our findings suggest noise-guided design may be a valuable strategy for achieving precision control over dynamic protein circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Although sequence-based computational methods can excel at predicting TF binding sites, they often exhibit TF-specific performance biases and rely heavily on high-quality training data. Here, we propose a structure-guided approach using AlphaFold 3 (AF3) to model TF-DNA complexes for downstream biophysical evaluation with FoldX. We benchmark this method on a SNP-SELEX dataset in which reference and alternative DNA alleles are tested for differential TF binding in vitro. For each allele pair, we generate AF3 models and assess binding differences using FoldX-derived binding energy changes and AF3's interface predicted template modelling (ipTM) score. Across three TFs, SPIB, SF-1 (steroidogenic factor 1, encoded by NR5A1) and PAX5, differences in ipTM ({triangleup}ipTM) often align with SNP-SELEX results, slightly surpassing energy-based metrics, although performance varies by TF, with notably poorer performance for PAX5. We further apply this approach to clinically relevant non-coding SNVs from published studies, accurately recapitulating 5 of 6 reported effects. These findings highlight the promise of highly interpretable structural modelling for non-coding variant interpretation, which could even encompass complex homomeric or heteromeric TF assemblies. AF3 provides robust TF-DNA complex structures that can capture subtle differences in binding induced by single-nucleotide changes. Augmented by biophysical binding evaluation, such an integrative approach can elucidate how non-coding variants affect TF binding and regulatory function.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

E. coli, a major causative agent of bloodstream infections, has evolved highly virulent and MDR strains, which contribute to the increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), complicating clinical management and reducing the efficacy of conventional antibiotic therapies. This study highlights the negative implications of MDR E. coli sepsis through the genomic and phenotypic characterization of E. coli 266631E isolated from a sepsis patient. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and minimum inhibitory concentration analysis revealed resistance to multiple antibiotics, including amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Whole genome sequencing identified a broad array of AMR genes encoding resistance to various antibiotic classes, such as macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, and cephalosporins. Notably, the CTX-M-15 gene, a key extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase determinant, was found in both the bacterial chromosome and an IncF-type plasmid, emphasizing the potential for horizontal gene transfer and rapid dissemination of resistance. Confirming the taxonomy of the isolate through querying its 16S rRNA sequence and genome in recognised bacterial taxonomic databases presented a challenge. The isolate showed genetic similarity to E. coli, E. fergusonii, and Shigella species despite their phenotypic differences and variations in their pathogenic traits. However, a simple phenotypic laboratory procedure, based on the biochemical and cultural differences among these bacteria in Coliform ChromoSelect Agar, confirmed the isolate as E. coli. This study highlights the importance of applying phenotypic approaches to support genomic identification of clinically significant bacteria, as this will help guide proper diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening infections like sepsis.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Across datasets, we delineate two replicable axes of human white matter development. First, we find a deep-to-superficial axis, in which superficial tract regions near the cortical surface exhibit greater age-related change than deep tract regions. Second, we demonstrate that the development of superficial tract regions aligns with the cortical hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-association axis, with tract ends adjacent to sensorimotor cortices maturing earlier than those adjacent to association cortices. These results reveal developmental variation along tracts that conventional tract-average analyses have previously obscured, challenging the implicit assumption that white matter tracts mature uniformly along their length. Such developmental variation along tracts may have functional implications, including mitigating ephaptic coupling in densely packed deep tract regions and tuning neural synchrony through hierarchical development in superficial tract regions - ultimately refining neural transmission in youth.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Moreover, sArdA family contains two subgroups, one of which is structurally similar to the N-terminal end of ArdA, while the other one - to the C-terminal end. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that genes encoding these proteins evolved into evolutionarily stable subfamilies, named sArdN and sArdC, respectively. Alphafold structure prediction of sArdA interaction with RM systems revealed four states of EcoKI, which differ the angle between its two M-subunits while interacting with different agents. Interestingly, both sArdN and sArdC triggered the same intermediate closed state of EcoKI indicating the possible new interaction pathways of Ards with RM systems.

For phenotypic studies in Escherichia coli cells, we cloned the sardN gene from the chromosome of Corynebacterium pilbarense and the sardC gene from Lactococcus cremoris. Both genes were shown to protect {lambda} phage DNA from restriction by the type I RM system. However, they revealed specificity to different restriction-modification systems. Specifically, sArdC was more effective against EcoR124II, whereas sArdN was more potent against EcoKI. Furthermore, both genes demonstrated high antimethylation activity against EcoKI.

However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unclear. Here, we report that SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a highly conserved protein quality control system responsible for clearing misfolded proteins from the ER, plays a key role in glucagon production by regulating turnover of the nascent proform of the PC2 enzyme (proPC2). Using a mouse model with SEL1L deletion in proglucagon-expressing cells, we observed a progressive decline in stimulated glucagon secretion and a reduction in pancreatic glucagon content. Mechanistically, we found that endogenous proPC2 is a substrate of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, and that degradation of misfolded proPC2 ensures the maturation of activation-competent proPC2 protein. These findings identify ERAD as a novel regulator of PC2 biology and an essential mechanism for maintaining  cell function.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

We imaged pyramidal cells (PCs), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons (INs) and found that locomotion reduced firing in PCs and VIP INs while increasing activity in SST and PV cells. Prolonged optical depolarization experiments and simulations revealed that intracellular theta oscillations are predominantly driven by inhibitory inputs in PCs and VIP cells. Firing rate-laser intensity (F-I) curves revealed distinct gain modulation across cell types, with a divisive gain reduction in PC bursting during locomotion, while simple spikes are unaffected.

However, the mechanisms by which pHe, intracellular pH (pHi), and Ca2+ levels coordinate the bidirectional transport of lysosomes remain poorly understood.

In this study, we identify RNF13 as a critical regulator of lysosomal positioning through its ubiquitin- dependent degradation of ARL8B. RNF13 activity is modulated by both pHi and Ca2+ levels. Specifically, we demonstrate that Ca2+-activated apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG-2) promotes retrograde lysosomal transport while simultaneously increasing pHi and decreasing lysosomal pH (pHlys). Elevated pHi deprotonates RNF13 at His332, enabling its interaction with Ca2+-bound ALG-2. This interaction activates RNF13, which inhibits ARL8B-mediated anterograde lysosomal transport. Furthermore, we show that alkaline pHe elevates pHlys, activating the lysosomal Ca2+ channel TRPML3. This activation enhances RNF13 activity, driving lysosomes to adopt a perinuclear localization. Thus, conditions such as starvation or alkaline pHe, which induce ALG-2 activation and pHi elevation, facilitate RNF13- mediated ARL8B degradation. In contrast, under acidic pHi conditions, RNF13 activity remains suppressed regardless of ALG-2 activation, leading to increased ARL8B levels. Additionally, we provide evidence linking the loss of RNF13 activity to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy-73, a neurological disorder characterized by severe developmental symptoms.

These findings deepen our understanding of lysosomal positioning mechanisms, highlighting the interplay between lysosomal Ca2+ release and dynamic changes in cytoplasmic and lysosomal pH.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

We report that deletion of the mRNA-translation repressor, eIF4A2 in early KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma leads to a dysregulated protein synthesis landscape characterised by a strongly upregulated secretome, enlarged secretory compartments, increased oxidative metabolism and acquisition of senescence-like characteristics. Paradoxically, this overdriven protein synthesis landscape delays tumorigenesis and leads to appearance of clusters of non-proliferative, p21-positive KRAS-expressing cells in the lung. Administration of rapamycin to reduce mRNA translation suppresses senescence and restores tumorigenesis following eIF4A2 deletion. Importantly, some eIF4A2 knockout cells overcome senescence to form tumours that exhibit enhanced MAP-kinase signalling and, in contrast to eIF4A2+/+ lesions, these may be eradicated by administration of a MEK inhibitor.

Heart rate variability (HRV) can evaluate autonomic function and monitor overexertion, potentially helping to mitigate PEM. This study aimed to use continuous multi-day HRV recordings to monitor overexertion and study autonomic function in Long COVID.

MethodHeart rate and HRV were continuously measured in 127 patients with long COVID (43{+/-}11 years, 32% male) and 21 healthy controls (42{+/-}13 years, 48% male), and daily life activities tracked in a logbook. Participants underwent a (sub)maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine heart rate at the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) to study HRV responses to exercise at different intensities.

ResultsHRV was lower in patients with long COVID compared to healthy controls during various daily activities and sleep (p<0.027). HRV remained lower for 24 hours after exercise below, at or above VT1 in patients, but not in healthy controls (p=0.010). Nighttime HRV decreased with intense exercise and longer durations in patients with long COVID (p=0.018), indicative of exercise-induced diurnal disturbances of the autonomic nervous system in long COVID.

ConclusionHeart rate variability, assessed by wearables, confirms autonomic dysfunction in patients with long COVID. The delayed recovery of the sympathovagal balance after exercise close and above to VT1 suggests that VT1 can be practically interpreted as a PEM threshold.

ApplicationThese results confirm the applicability of wearables to assess autonomic function and manage overexertion in long COVID patients.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSPatients with long COVID often experience fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise (PEM). HRV can be used as a non-invasive tool to measure autonomic function and recovery. Anecdotal evidence suggests lower HRV in patients with long COVID, but measurements are usually very short.

What this study addsThis study demonstrates that continuous HRV monitoring through wearables can effectively identify overexertion and autonomic dysfunction during daily activities in patients with long COVID. Patients with long COVID have a lower heart rate variability during sleep and HRV remained significantly lower for a longer period after moderate-to-heavy exercise, that is generally associated with the induction of post-exertional malaise.

How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThis study supports the use of wearables for assessing autonomic function and overexertion in daily life, helping patients with long COVID in pacing daily activities to mitigate symptoms of post-exertional malaise. HRV tracking after exercise shows that VT1 is a potential threshold for PEM. Sports physicians and physiotherapists can incorporate HRV biofeedback measures into pacing advice to patients. Additional research is needed to further investigate the effect of such an intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704946

Although peptides are the cognate ligands for many of these receptors, identifying endogenous peptide agonists for GPCRs remains a significant challenge. Deep learning-based protein structure prediction algorithms, such as AlphaFold (AF) have utility in non-structural tasks including protein-protein interaction prediction, suggesting they may be useful for predicting GPCR-peptide agonist interactions. Leveraging a dataset of experimentally validated agonist and non-agonist GPCR-peptide interactions from Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that AF-Multimer confidence metrics enable partial discrimination between GPCR-agonist and non-agonist complexes. To better reflect agonist-bound conformations, AF-Multistate templates are used to produce active-state GPCR-peptide complexes, improving discriminatory power. Embeddings from the final hidden layer of AF-Multimer's neural network, which capture structural and interaction patterns, were used to train random forest classifiers to assess whether AF-Multimer protein representations can distinguish agonist from non-agonist complexes. Feature performance analysis reveals that AF-Multimer's pair representations outperform single representations, with distinct subregions of the pair representation providing complementary predictive signals. Building on these findings, we developed DeorphaNN--a graph neural network that integrates active-state GPCR-peptide structural predictions, interatomic interactions, and pair representations to predict agonist identity. DeorphaNN's predictive utility generalizes to datasets outside of C. elegans, including annelids and humans, and experimental validation of predicted agonists for two orphan GPCRs uncovers their cognate agonists. Our approach offers a resource to accelerate GPCR deorphanization through the in silico identification of receptor-agonist candidates for AI-guided experimental validation.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Using C. elegans, we demonstrate that TC-NER deficiency leads to DNA damage-induced motoneuronal and developmental failure, primarily caused by the lack of lesion removal due to persistent lesion-stalling of RNA polymerase II. If, in the absence of TC-NER, lesion-stalled RNA polymerase II is processed and removed, global genome NER acts as backup pathway to repair transcription-blocking lesions and prevents DNA damage-induced developmental failure. Our results furthermore show that processing of lesion-stalled RNA Polymerase II facilitates TC-NER and involves the activity of multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases. These findings reveal that persistently stalled RNA polymerase II, rather than TC-NER deficiency, is the major driver of severe disease features associated with TC-NER defects.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

More recently, links have been reported between iron and the severity of viral infections. In this study, we characterize a crucial relationship between iron metabolism and IAV infection and disease. Methods: Iron-related gene expression was assessed in human airway epithelial cells (AEC) infected with IAV. AECs were cultured with ferric iron, iron-loaded transferrin, or iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), prior to infection with IAV. Mice were placed on a high iron diet for 8 weeks prior to infection with IAV or treated with anti-transferrin receptor-1 (TFR1) antibody during IAV infection. The effects of iron modulation and depletion of TFR1-mediated responses on IAV infection were assessed. Measurements and main results: Iron-related gene expression and metabolism are altered systemically and in lung tissues and AECs during IAV infections. Increasing iron availability increases viral titer in AECs, while DFO protects against iron-induced increased susceptibility to infection. Increasing systemic iron loading, which increases iron levels in the lung, increases viral titer, proinflammatory responses, airway inflammation, and worsens IAV-induced disease in terms of lung function and weight loss in vivo. Inhibition of TFR1 protects against IAV-induced disease in vivo. Conclusion: IAV infections remain a major threat to human health and global economies. Strategies that boost protective, or reduce pathogenic, host responses may provide broadly effective, long-term therapeutic options. We have identified a key role for iron metabolism in modifying host responses to IAV that can be harnessed to protect against disease.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

One of the most fascinating adaptations to this lifestyle is the specific silencing of individual rDNA genes in the human host that are de-repressed following host-to-vector transmission. In this study, we defined the epigenetic signatures of rRNA transcription and found that rDNA silencing relies on aerobic glycolysis, the sole energy-generating pathway in the human host. We show that disruption of NAD+ regeneration during lactate fermentation promotes rDNA de-repression and identify the sirtuin histone deacetylase Sir2a as the mediator between fluctuating NAD+ levels and a functional transcriptional outcome. Hence, rDNA activation appears to be coupled to the metabolic state of the parasite as it transitions from aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration during host-to-vector transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Bacterial Sec substrates fold outside the cell and often use DsbA-catalysed disulfide bond formation between cysteines to ensure correct folding. Extracellular protein misfolding triggers a stress response that involves production of dual function HtrA-family chaperone/proteases. In Gram-negative bacteria this is called the envelope stress response and in Gram-positive bacteria the secretion stress response, but the exact signals sensed by bacteria to trigger these stress responses are not well understood. In Streptomyces bacteria the secretion stress response is mediated by the CutRS and CssRS two-component systems which control the levels of four conserved HtrA-family chaperones. Here we show that the CutS sensor kinase contains two conserved cysteine residues in its extracellular sensor domain that control CutS activity. CssS also has two conserved and invariant cysteines in its sensor domain, and we propose that CutS and CssS detect the extracellular redox state and work together to ensure secreted proteins fold correctly in the fluctuating soil environment. Further analysis of ~12,800 genomes indicated that 98.9% of strains across all bacterial classes have at least one sensor kinase with two or more extracellular cysteine residues, suggesting that extracellular redox sensing by two-component systems is widespread in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Consistent with that, the expression of Sbp1 in human cells reduced the cytoplasmic condensates of FUS and TDP43 mutants (FUS-P525L and TDP43 lacking nuclear localization signal-{Delta}NLS) and increased nuclear localization of the FUS-P525L in an RGG-motif dependent manner. In accordance with the yeast data, we observed that the viability of cells expressing FUS-P525L improved upon the expression of Sbp1. In-cell sedimentation assay revealed that purified Sbp1 could partition FUS-P525L, but not the TDP43-{Delta}NLS mutant, from enriched insoluble condensates to soluble fraction. In-vitro sedimentation assay using a two-component purified system confirmed that partitioning of FUS, but not TDP43, increased to the soluble fraction in an RGG-motif-dependent manner. Finally, incubating the cells expressing FUS-P525L and TDP43-{Delta}NLS mutant with RGG-peptide resulted in a reduction of condensate size within the cells, suggesting the sufficiency of RGG peptides. Overall, our results identify a role of RGG-peptide in disassembling mutant FUS and TDP43 condensates implicated in ALS, projecting their possible therapeutic role in treating ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Uniquely among plasma sandwich immunoassay tests, cf-nucleosomes are nucleoproteins with a complex electrochemistry. Formaldehyde crosslinking is common in the investigation of cellular nucleoproteins by chromatin immunoprecipitation. cf-nucleosome sandwich immunoassay similarly involves isolation from plasma by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We investigated immunoassay of crosslinked plasma cf-nucleosomes in human cancer samples. Experimental Design: Plasma cf-nucleosomes were covalently crosslinked by blood collection in tubes containing a formaldehyde-releasing agent. Plasma samples were collected from asymptomatic healthy volunteers, treatment-naive cancer patients diagnosed with one of 21 different cancer types, and hospitalized patients with non-cancer conditions. Samples were assayed for a variety of nucleosome species at two independent sites and using immunoassays available from different commercial manufacturers. The assay cutoff was set at the highest cf-nucleosome level measured for any asymptomatic control subject to obtain results for cancer patients at 100% observed specificity.Results: An elevated level of crosslinked plasma cf-nucleosomes was observed in 112 of 229 cancer patients tested (49% sensitivity), including 11 of 32 Stage I solid cancers (34% Stage I sensitivity). Elevated levels also occurred in hospitalized patients with non-cancer pathologies, but no false-positive results occurred among 150 asymptomatic control subjects. Conclusions: Immunoassay of crosslinked plasma cf-nucleosomes achieved clinically meaningful sensitivity for cancer at 100% observed specificity in asymptomatic subjects, and shows promise for the identification of asymptomatic individuals at high risk of an undetected cancer.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704946

Traditional community detection algorithms assign each node to one module, but this representation cannot capture integrative, multi-functional nodes that span multiple communities. Despite the increasing availability of overlapping community detection algorithms (OCDAs) to capture such integrative nodes, there is no objective procedure for selecting the most appropriate method and its parameters for a given problem. Here we overcome this limitation by introducing a data-driven method for selecting an OCDA and its parameters from performance on a tailored ensemble of generated benchmark networks, assessing 22 unique algorithms and parameter settings. Applied to the human structural connectome, we find that the `Order Statistics Local Optimization Method' (OSLOM) best identifies ground-truth overlapping structure in the benchmark ensemble and yields a seven-network decomposition of the human cortex. These modules are bridged by fifteen overlapping regions that generally sit at the apex of the putative cortical hierarchy---suggesting integrative, higher-order function---with network participation increasing along the cortical hierarchy, a finding not supported using a non-overlapping modular decomposition. This data-driven approach to selecting OCDAs is applicable across domains, opening new avenues to detecting and quantifying informative structures in complex real-world networks.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Molecular glue degraders (MGD) are monovalent small molecules that accomplish this by redirecting E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins, offering the potential to degrade previously unliganded and ''undruggable'' proteins in cancer, neurodegenerative, and other diseases. While attractive due to their drug-like properties, MGDs are exceptionally hard to discover and have largely been identified serendipitously. The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase is the second most widely used effector for TPD, though current VHL-based degraders are primarily large heterobifunctional PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) designed using target-based ligands. Here, we have instead pursued target-agnostic discovery of VHL MGDs leveraging proprietary ultra-miniaturized microfluidics devices (Picowells) to facilitate unbiased RNA-seq screening of a biased E3-focused library. This resulted in dGEM3, a novel VHL molecular glue that targets the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex member GEMIN3 for degradation. Through a combination of cellular, biochemical, and biophysical assays, we have characterized the GEMIN3 degron within its helicase ATP-binding domain, and how the kinetics of ternary complex formation impact degradation. These findings provide insights on the re-programmability of VHL for novel targets using drug-like molecular glues.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Phosphorylation is particularly common for intrinsically disordered proteins and can significantly modulate their function and potential to interact with binding partners. To understand the biophysical origins of how phosphorylation of disordered proteins influences their function, it is valuable to investigate how the modifications lead to changes in their conformational ensembles. Here, we have used a top-down data-driven approach to develop a coarse-grained molecular dynamics model compatible with the CALVADOS protein simulation model to study the effects of serine and threonine phosphorylation on the global structural properties of disordered proteins. We parameterise the model using experimental data on the effects of phosphorylation on global dimensions. By comparing with baseline models and simulations using the phosphomimetics aspartate and glutamate, we show that the effect of phosphorylation on the global dimensions of disordered proteins is mostly driven by the additional charge. We envisage that our model can be applied to study the effects of phosphorylation of disordered proteins at the proteome scale as well as to study the important roles of protein phosphorylation on phase separation.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

However, high-efficiency editing requires careful optimization for each locus to be modified which can be tedious and time-consuming. In this work, we developed a simple, fast and cheap method for the Editing and Assembly of SYnthetic operons using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering (EASY-CRISPR) in Escherichia coli. Highly efficient editing of the different constitutive elements of the operons can be achieved by using a set of optimized guide RNAs and single- or double-stranded DNA repair templates carrying relatively short homology arms. This facilitates the construction of multiple genetic tools, including mutant libraries or reporter genes. EASY-CRISPR is also highly modular, as we provide alternative and complementary versions of the operon inserted in three loci which can be edited iteratively and easily combined. As a proof of concept, we report the construction of several fusions with reporter genes confirming known post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms and the construction of saturated and unbiased mutant libraries. In summary, the EASY-CRISPR system provides a flexible genomic expression platform that can be used both for the understanding of biological processes and as a tool for bioengineering applications.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Further investigation into coding variants revealed 835 significant associations, including well-established ACMG pathogenic variants and multiple putatively novel associations.

We used fMRI to quantify V1 preferred spatial frequency and cortical magnification as a function of both eccentricity and polar angle, and across individual observers (n=40). We found that the two measurements: (1) declined proportionally with eccentricity; (2) covaried systematically with polar angle, but with variation in cortical magnification double that of preferred spatial frequency; and (3) covaried across individuals. These data reveal a link between V1 preferred spatial frequency and cortical magnification within observers -as a function of visual field location- and between observers -when summed over visual field location.

This unregulated response to self is fuelled by heightened metabolic programmes, which offers a promising new direction to uncover novel treatment strategies. {beta}hydrolase domain-containing protein 11 (ABHD11) is a mitochondrial hydrolase that maintains the catalytic function of ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH), and its expression in CD4+ T cells has been linked to remission status in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the importance of ABHD11 in regulating T cell metabolism and function - and thus, the downstream implication for autoimmunity - is yet to be explored. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of ABHD11 dampens cytokine production by human and mouse T cells. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ABHD11 inhibition are attributed to increased 24,25-epoxycholesterol (24,25-EC) biosynthesis and subsequent liver X receptor (LXR) activation, which arise from a compromised TCA cycle. The impaired cytokine profile established by ABHD11 inhibition is extended to two patient cohorts of autoimmunity. Importantly, using a murine model of accelerated type 1 diabetes (T1D), we show that targeting ABHD11 suppresses cytokine production in antigen-specific T cells and delays the onset of diabetes in vivo. Collectively, our work provides pre-clinical evidence that ABHD11 is an encouraging drug target in T cell-mediated autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

Using long-reads, we generated a Capuchino Seedeater (Sporophila) pangenome, including 16 individuals from seven species, to investigate how SVs contribute to species and coloration differences. Leveraging this pangenome, we mapped short-read data from 127 individuals to perform FST scans and genome-wide association studies. Species divergence primarily arises from SNPs and indels (< 50 bp) in non-coding regions of melanin-related genes, as larger SVs rarely overlap with divergence peaks. One exception was a 55 bp deletion near the OCA2 and HERC2 genes, associated with feather pheomelanin content.

We retrieved 71 cetacean mitochondrial genomes from a public database and designed 20 candidate primer sets, which were assessed in silico for their specificity and capacity to differentiate cetacean sequences. Four primer sets with the best in silico performance were selected for empirical validation using DNA from tissue samples and eDNA from seawater collected from aquarium pools and Hong Kong coastal waters. All four primer sets effectively amplified cetacean DNA from tissue samples. However, in the aquarium pool tests, three primer sets failed to accurately identify one or more cetacean species due to a lack of interspecific variation within the amplified region. From these, we selected one primer set targeting 268 bp insert length in mitochondrial 12S rRNA region, named Ceta, and applied it to water samples collected from Hong Kong coastal waters, where the iconic Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) was observed.

Many of the Variovorax genomes in the NCBI database were generated using only short-read data and were assembled to the permanent draft stage. We acquired a set of these isolates and used the MinION long-read sequencing device to generate additional data to allow hybrid assemblies of these genomes. Here we present the finished assemblies of 15 Variovorax isolates from diverse ecosystems that were previously only available as permanent drafts. When added to the previously published Variovorax assemblies for EPS, CSUSB, and VAI-C and those published by other groups, we found significant diversity in genome architecture. We found that there are plasmids, megaplasmids, and chromids that are distinguishable using Guanine-Cytosine (G+C content) content as a signal. We identified a plasmid integration event in NFACC27 and identify potential evolutionary relationships in the second replicons based on ParB homology as well as ANI.

Contemporary single-cell studies simultaneously measure genome-wide transcription levels for thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. While the characterization of cell population differences has often occurred through differential expression analysis, tiny effect sizes become statistically significant when thousands of cells are available for each population, compromising biological interpretation. Moreover, these large studies have spurred the development of methods to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) directly from the data, and GRN databases are becoming more comprehensive. In this work, we propose a statistical model for gene expression measures and an inference method that leverage GRNs to deconvolve transcription factor (TF) activity from gene expression, by probabilistically assigning mRNA molecules to TFs. This shifts the paradigm from investigating gene expression differences to regulatory differences at the level of TF activity, aiding interpretation and allowing prioritization of a limited number of TFs responsible for significant contributions to the observed gene expression differences. The inferred TF activities result in intuitive prioritization of TFs in terms of the (difference in) estimated number of molecules they produce, in contrast to other widely-used methods relying on arbitrary enrichment scores. Our model allows the incorporation of prior information on the regulatory potential between each TF and target gene through prior distributions, and is able to deal with both repressing and activating interactions. We compare our approach to other TF activity estimation methods using two simulation experiments and two case studies.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

MethodsWe used nationwide data from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, using 28- and 180-days risk periods following BNT162b2 vaccination or a positive test for SARS-Cov-2 infection. Individuals aged 5-19 years during the study period (1st January 2021-31st December 2022) were included. We used a common data model, using individual level data linked from nation-wide registers and a shared analysis script to harmonize data and analysis. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) comparing outcome rates in risk windows to unvaccinated or uninfected follow-up rates. This was supplemented with self-controlled case series analyses. Results from different countries were analyzed jointly in a meta-analysis.

ResultsWe observed no clear association between BNT162b2 vaccination and new-onset AH, GBS or T1D. Neither did we observe any clear association with recurrent hospital visits following BNT162b2 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection. An association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS was observed in both the 28-day and 180-day risk window (relative risk (RR) 15.10, 95% CI, 1.11-205.94, and RR 3.85, 1.33-11.14, respectively).

ConclusionsBNT162b2 vaccination was not associated with new-onset or recurrent hospital visits of these diseases in children and adolescents. Sars-CoV-2 infection was associated with new-onset GBS. Estimates were however uncertain due to the small number of cases.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704946

To improve the efficiency of this process and accelerate the development of new mAbs, we characterized and isolated antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) from the spleen of immunized mice before cell fusion. This approach resulted in a high yield of hybridoma generation by increasing the probability of successive pairing between the most suitable cell fusion partners. Specifically, we developed an optimized workflow combining Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) with antibody secretion assays, using a panel of five cell-surface markers (CD3, TACI, CD138, MHC-II, and B220) that allowed us to identify a particular ASC subset with key characteristics. Such ASCs exhibited a plasmablast phenotype with high MHC-II expression and secreted high levels of Ag-specific antibodies in immunized mice. These features were also found in hybridomas, suggesting a preferential fusion of myeloma cells with this ASCs subset. Finally, the targeted electrofusion of TACI-high and CD138-high sorted ASCs led to a 100% fusion yield compared to a non-targeted approach. In particular, over 60% of these generated hybridomas secreted Ag-specific mAbs. Collectively, these results pave the way for a highly efficient method to produce new mAbs by cell fusion, which could facilitate hybridoma generation and expand therapeutic applications of mAbs.","NA","biorxiv",1742767704946

While COVID-19 exacerbated the decline in routine vaccination through disruption of healthcare services and the diversion of resources, factors including vaccine hesitancy, socioeconomic disparities and vaccine policy also contribute to changes in vaccination behavior. Understanding the factors that influence vaccination choice is necessary to develop effective public health policy.

MethodsWe collect county-level MMR vaccination rates for kindergarten children from 2017 - 2024 for 2,266 U.S. counties, evaluate coverage patterns and trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and implement multivariable weighted logistic regression models to identify factors associated with low and declining MMR vaccination rates in U.S. counties.

FindingsWe reveal a nationwide decline in MMR rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, with declines observed in 1,688 of the counties evaluated. We find state-level non-medical exemption (NME) policies to be strongly associated with low and declining MMR rates. We identify a positive association in vaccination rates across vaccine types. We find higher MMR rates are positively associated with Republican-aligned counties and declines in MMR rates to be positively associated with COVID-19 death rates.

InterpretationThe significant association between NMEs and low and declining MMR rates suggest these state level policies are harmful and reduce vaccination coverage. The positive associations among vaccine types suggest spillover effects in vaccine seeking behavior. The association between MMR rates and Republican-aligned counties contrast COVID-19 vaccination patterns, highlighting the complex nature of political polarization on vaccine-related behavior, while the association between MMR declines and COVID-19 death rate reveals an additional burden posed by the pandemic.

While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1742767704946
