We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark. Methods: A cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza. Results: Among 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80). Conclusion: COVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754698

In 2021, Jesse Bloom reported on the recovery of a dataset of raw sequencing reads that had been removed from the NCBI SRA database at the request of the data generators, a scientific team at Wuhan University (Wang et al., 2020b). Bloom concluded that the data deletion had obfuscated the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that deletion may have been requested to comply with a government order; further, he questioned reported sample collection dates on and after January 30, 2020. Here, we show that sample collection dates were published in 2020 by Wang et al. together with the sequencing reads, and match the dates given by the authors in 2021. Collection dates of January 30, 2020 were manually removed by Bloom during his analysis of the data. We examine mutations in these sequences and confirm that they are entirely consistent with the previously known genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 of late January 2020. Finally, we explain how an apparent phylogenetic rooting paradox described by Bloom was resolved by subsequent analysis. Our reanalysis demonstrates that there was no basis to question the sample collection dates published by Wang et al..

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Engineered gut bacteria offer a promising alternative due to their ability to persist in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and sense and respond to specific environmental signals. However, probiotics that have previously been engineered to report on inflammatory and other disease biomarkers in the Gl tract rely on fluorescent or bioluminescent reporters, whose signals cannot be resolved in situ due to the poor penetration of light in tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probiotic biosensors that can be imaged in situ using ultrasound - a widely available, inexpensive imaging modality providing sub-mm spatial resolution deep inside the body. These biosensors are based on the clinically approved probiotic bacterium E. coli Nissle, which we engineered to transiently colonize the GI tract, sense inflammatory biomarkers, and respond by expressing air-filled sound-scattering protein nanostructures called gas vesicles. After optimizing biomolecular signaling circuits to respond sensitively to the biomarkers thiosulfate and tetrathionate and produce strong and stable ultrasound contrast, we validated our living biosensors in vivo by noninvasively imaging antibiotic-induced inflammation in mice. By connecting cell-based diagnostic agents to ultrasound, this ""diagnostic yogurt"" will make it easier, cheaper, and less painful to diagnose and monitor IBD or other GI conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Their significance is highlighted by peroxisome biogenesis disorders; severe childhood diseases marked by disrupted lipid metabolism. One mechanism regulating peroxisome abundance is through selective ubiquitylation of peroxisomal membrane proteins that triggers peroxisome degradation via selective autophagy (pexophagy). However, the mechanisms regulating pexophagy remain poorly understood in mammalian cells. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved AAA-ATPase p97 and its membrane embedded adaptor UBXD8 are essential for maintaining peroxisome abundance. From quantitative proteomic studies we reveal that loss of UBXD8 affects many peroxisomal proteins. We find depletion of UBXD8 results in a loss of peroxisomes in a manner that is independent of the known role of UBXD8 in ER associated degradation (ERAD). Loss of UBXD8 or inhibition of p97 increases peroxisomal turnover through autophagy and can be rescued by depleting key autophagy proteins or overexpressing the deubiquitylating enzyme USP30. Furthermore, we find increased ubiquitylation of the peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70 in cells lacking UBXD8 or p97. Collectively, our findings identify a new role for the p97-UBXD8 complex in regulating peroxisome abundance by suppressing pexophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

In Escherichia coli, the gene encoding RF2, prfB, contains an in-frame premature RF2-specific stop codon. Therefore, a programmed ribosomal frameshift is required to translate full-length RF2. Here, we investigate the diversity of prfB frameshifting through bioinformatic analyses of >12,000 genomes. We present evidence that prfB frameshifting autoregulates RF2 levels throughout the bacterial domain since (i) the prfB in-frame stop codon is always TGA or TAA, both of which are recognized by RF2, and never the RF1-specific TAG stop codon, and (ii) species that lack the autoregulatory programmed frameshift likely need higher RF2 levels since, on average, they have significantly higher RF2-specific stop codon usage. Overexpression of prfB without the autoregulatory frameshift motif is toxic to Bacillus subtilis, an organism with intermediate RF2-specific stop codon usage. We did not detect the programmed frameshift in any Actinobacteriota. Consistent with this finding, we observed very low frameshift efficiency at the prfB frameshift motif in the Actinobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Our work provides a more complete picture of the evolution of the RF2 programmed frameshifting motif, and its usage to prevent toxic overexpression of RF2.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein-protein interaction interfaces, we find 87% are predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further, FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.

Significance StatementPeptides can regulate protein interactions by binding to specific interfaces, and fragments of larger proteins have high potential to function in this manner. Recently developed experimental methods allow massively parallel measurement of protein fragment-based inhibition in vivo. However, we have lacked comparable computational methods to predict which protein fragments act as inhibitors and how they bind. Here we report a new approach, FragFold, which leverages high-throughput AlphaFold predictions of protein - fragment binding to tackle these problems at scale. FragFold is successful at predicting inhibitory protein fragments and their binding modes across diverse protein structures and functions. This new approach stands to enable proteome-wide discovery of inhibitory protein fragments and aid the interpretation of high-throughput experimental measurements of inhibitory activity.

All CoVs encode a proofreading 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 (nsp14-ExoN) that mediates proofreading and high-fidelity replication and is critical for other roles in replication and pathogenesis. The in vitro enzymatic activity of nsp14 ExoN is enhanced in the presence of the cofactor nsp10. We introduced alanine substitutions in nsp14 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) at the nsp14-10 interface and recovered mutant viruses with a range of impairments in replication and in vitro biochemical exonuclease activity. Two of these substitutions, nsp14 K7A and D8A, hadimpairments intermediate between WT-MHV nsp14 and the known ExoN(-) D89A/E91A nsp14 catalytic inactivation mutant.

Here, we investigate how extracellular pH changes with age and its impact on longevity, using fly and mouse models. We find that extracellular acidification occurs in flies during aging and correlates to mortality rate. With age, flies also become more susceptible to die from acidotic stress, which can be prevented by alkalotic treatment. Acidification is caused by insufficient acid elimination, linked to downregulation of genes in the fly excretory tract that control pH and ATP production, essential for active secretion initiation. In mice, we show that lymph-drained interstitial fluids acidify with age. Expression of genes, whose pathogenic loss-of-function variants cause tubular acidosis in humans, is decreased in the kidneys of aging mice. Overall, this study sheds light on dysregulated systemic acid-base balance as a conserved pathophysiological mechanism of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Two essential technologies underpin this achievement: the ability to clone entire genomes in host organisms, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the successful transplant of these genomes into recipient cells to generate living organisms. In all previous work the recipient cell in genome transplantation experiments has been Mycoplasma capricolum. In this study, we explored the potential of using Mycoplasma mycoides strains as recipient cells for genome transplantation. By increasing polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration from 5% to 10%, we successfully transplanted various M. mycoides strains using several M. mycoides recipient cells.

Symptoms usually manifest in the first year of life and include prolonged severe seizures, developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. DS patients have an increased mortality rate, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Approximately 90% of patients carry a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium ion channel, NaV1.1. The NaV1.1 channel is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. Previous studies have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which specifically downregulates SCN1A gene expression. This natural antisense transcript (NAT) can be modulated by AntagoNATs, small synthetic oligonucleotides developed to inhibit NAT function. In a DS mouse model, AntagoNATs were shown to modulate Scn1a expression by targeting the Scn1a NAT, improving seizure frequency after repeated administration. Here, we have developed novel AntagoNATs and incorporated these into a clinically relevant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy vector, to test in a DS mouse model (Scn1a+/-) and provide a one-off treatment approach. Eighteen AntagoNATs were tested in vitro; from the best performing candidates, we selected two AntagoNAT sequences (K & H) for in vivo testing as they had the highest homology (90%) to human SCN1A NAT. We administered both vectors to newborn Scn1a+/- mice via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) injection to target the brain and heart. AAV9-AntagoNAT-H significantly increased survival, decreased febrile seizures and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency compared to the PBS control group. When administered at P14 by ICV and IV injection, AAV9-AntagoNAT-H increased survival. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated for the first time the delivery of AntagoNAT technology via an AAV9 vector and thus offering the possibility of a one-time treatment for DS patients.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

This study investigated this concept using a psoriasis humanized mouse model.

MethodsHealthy human skin was grafted onto SCID/beige mice (n=25), and one month later, psoriatic lesions were induced by intradermal injection of autologous, in vitro IL-2- preactivated PBMCs. Following lesion development, topical dexamethasone (DEX) was applied to induce lesion remission. After lesions disappeared, the mice were exposed to either sonic or sham stress for 24 hours.

ResultsSonic stress led to the relapse of psoriatic lesions in all human skin xenografts within 14 days. This relapse was associated with significant changes in psoriasis-related skin characteristics: increased epidermal thickness, K16 expression, keratinocyte proliferation, antimicrobial peptide expression (S100A7, h{beta}2-defensin), and immune activation markers (HLA-DR, ICAM-1, CD1d, MICA-NKG2D). Additionally, epidermal and dermal immune cells (CD3+, CD8+, CD11c+, CD56+, ILC3, c-KIT+ or tryptase+ cells) and psoriasis-associated pro-inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, IL-22, IL-15, IL-17A/F, IFN-{gamma}, and TNF) were found to be increased. Neurogenic inflammation biomarkers (NGF, NK1-R, and substance P) were also significantly upregulated in stressed mice. Treatment with the FDA-approved neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, aprepitant, prevented stress-induced psoriatic relapses in 4 out of 5 mice and normalized most inflammatory and neurobiological markers.

ConclusionsThese findings provide novel, conclusive evidence that perceived stress can trigger psoriatic lesions in human skin xenografts in vivo and highlight the role of substance P-dependent neurogenic inflammation in this process.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

MirGeneDB now contains entries for 21,822 microRNA genes (5,160 of these from the new species) belonging to 1743 microRNA families. The inclusion of these new species allowed us to refine both the evolutionary node of appearance of a number of microRNA genes/families, as well as MirGeneDBs phylogenetically informed nomenclature system. Updated covariance models of all microRNA families, along with all smallRNA read data are now downloadable. These enhanced annotations will allow researchers to analyze microRNA properties such as secondary structure and features of their biogenesis within a robust phylogenetic context and without the database plagued with numerous false positives and false negatives.

Whereas these pathways have been extensively studied individually, their integrated dynamics, including the interplay between protein synthesis and degradation, and the coordination between lysosomal and UPS pathways, remain underexplored. Here, we couple stable isotope pulse-labeling and mass spectrometry to quantify and kinetically model proteome dynamics following mTOR inhibition in cultured human cells. Using a combination of genetics and pharmacological inhibitors, we identify proteins strictly degraded by one pathway, those that undergo multimodal degradation, and others that can flexibly access the proteasome or lysosome subject to the availability of either. Our data resource, comprised of [~]5.2 million proteomic measurements, reveals that the UPS and lysosomal pathway operate with disparate kinetics, and highlights the rapid nature of lysosomal degradation. Additionally, we observe that cells coordinate the synthesis and degradation of translation initiation and elongation factors, leading to preferential synthesis from key classes of mRNA transcripts. Taken together, this work illuminates the complex, integrated pathways influencing proteostasis when mTOR is inhibited, provides a rich resource detailing the kinetics of protein synthesis and degradation, and establishes a robust methodology for measuring proteome dynamics on a per-protein basis in the context of cellular stress.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

While microbial communities were mostly host-specific, we found both specialist and generalist bacteria, even among closely related species, with notable variation between host species. Some generalists emerged host-specific only at the strain level, suggesting recent host switches. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence of codiversification between hosts and symbionts. Instead, symbiont gains, losses, and replacements led to functional differences, such as the ability to degrade pollen-derived pectin.

While lytic spread was sensitive to the presence of capsid entry/uncoating inhibitors, non-lytic spread was not.

Here, we show that one such protein, BLTP3A/UHRF1BP1, associates with VAMP7-positive vesicles via its C-terminal region and anchors them to lysosomes via the binding of its chorein domain containing N-terminal region to Rab7. Upon damage of lysosomal membranes and resulting mATG8 recruitment to their surface by CASM, BLTP3A first dissociates from lysosomes but then reassociates with them via an interaction of its LIR motif with mATG8. Such interaction is mutually exclusive to the binding of BLTP3A to vesicles and leaves its N-terminal chorein domain, i.e. the proposed entry site of lipids into this family of proteins, available for binding to another membrane, possibly the ER. Our findings reveal that BLTP3A is an effector CASM, potentially as part of a mechanism to help repair or minimize lysosome damage by delivering lipids.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

While emerging multiplexed imaging methods can simultaneously localize genomic regions and nuclear proteins, their ability to accurately measure DNA-protein interactions is constrained by the diffraction limit of optical microscopy. Here, we describe expansion in situ genome sequencing (ExIGS), a technology that enables sequencing of genomic DNA and superresolution localization of nuclear proteins in single cells. We applied ExIGS to fibroblast cells derived from an individual with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome to characterize how variation in nuclear morphology affects spatial chromatin organization. Using this data, we discovered that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant euchromatin repression that may erode cell identity. Further, we show that lamin abnormalities heterogeneously increase the repressive environment of the nucleus in tissues and aged cells. These results demonstrate that ExIGS may serve as a generalizable platform for connecting nuclear abnormalities to changes in gene regulation across disease contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae worldwide exhibit introgressions from the sister species S. paradoxus, despite the average sequence identity between these species being lower than 90%. While S. cerevisiae isolates from the Neotropics are known for their high levels of introgression, the evolutionary events leading to the unusually high prevalence of them remain unclear. Here, we sequenced 216 S. cerevisiae isolates living in open agave fermentation across Mexico, a habitat at the interface of natural and industrial environments. The genomes of these strains revealed considerable genetic diversity and population structure linked to geographic distribution, which had been overlooked due to undersampling of this megadiverse region. These strains, along with those from French Guiana, Ecuador, and Brazil, form a broader Neotropical phylogenetic cluster that is notably enriched with introgressions. Surprisingly, the origins and conservation patterns of introgressions indicate multiple hybridization events, suggesting an unprecedented scenario of flexible species barriers in this region. Our findings underscore concurrent evolutionary processes--geographical stratification and multiple introgressions--that shape the genomes of a diverse lineage of S. cerevisiae. Yeasts from the Neotropics thus provide a natural laboratory for exploring the mechanisms and adaptive significance of introgressive hybridization in eukaryotic genome evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Although an EEG shows advantages in availability and cost compared to the current diagnostic tools, it is not routinely used in clinical practice. Previous reviews have either focused on single disease populations and/or solely on resting state EEG. To evaluate the utility of EEG for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis, we conducted a systematic review across Alzheimers disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Lewy Body Dementia (DLB).

MethodsWe searched databases Pubmed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for articles published from 2000 to 2023 investigating resting-state and task-based EEG-markers in biomarker-proven AD, FTD and DLB.

ResultsOur search yielded a total of 12010 studies, of which 71 papers were eligible: 34 on AD, 18 on DLB and 9 on FTD. Slowing of the frequency spectrum was a common observation across diseases, achieving excellent sensitivity in AD and DLB. Research on FTD was limited and with varying results in the discrimination from healthy controls, although connectivity analysis and microstates are promising avenues. In differential diagnosis, both spectral and connectivity metrics show encouraging results. Task-based EEG emerges as a promising tool in early AD.

ConclusionEEG shows promise as a cost-effective, non-invasive tool for early detection and differential diagnosis. Future research should aim to collect standardized data from multicentric cohorts, across multiple diseases and stages, and explore the neural underpinnings of these diseases, to improve interpretability of the findings.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754698

We show kaposin RNA is both necessary and sufficient for NS remodelling, and ablating kaposin colocalization with NSs using kaposin-deficient recombinant viruses impairs viral gene expression. This is the first example of an RNA (cellular or viral) capable of scaffolding NS and the first study to define kaposin as an important regulator of KSHV gene expression and, by extension, KSHV-associated disease.

Here, we report the structure of the complete extracellular flagellum, encompassing the hook, hook-filament junction, filament, and cap. This structure reveals intermediates of filament assembly, providing a molecular blueprint for flagellin folding and insertion at the filament tip. Mutagenesis and functional assays demonstrate the crucial roles of the terminal regions of the cap in flagellin incorporation, and of the structural integrity of the hook-filament junction. Finally, the structure of the cap and hook-filament junction prior to filament assembly reveals the structural basis for the initiation of filament assembly.

Lysogenic bacteriophages can integrate their genome into the bacterial chromosome and are known to promote genetic transfer between bacterial strains. However, the contribution of lysogenic phages to the incidence of AMR is poorly understood. Here, in a set of 187 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from 82 patients with CF, we evaluate the links between prophages and both genomic and phenotypic resistance to five anti-pseudomonal antibiotics: tobramycin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, aztreonam, and tazobactam. We find that P. aeruginosa isolates contain on average 3.06 +/-1.84 (SD) predicted prophages. We find no significant association between the number of prophages per isolate and the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) for any of these antibiotics. We then investigate the relationship between particular prophages and AMR. We identify a single lysogenic phage that is associated with phenotypic resistance to the antibiotic tobramycin. Consistent with this association, we identify AMR genes associated with resistance to tobramycin in these strains and find that they are not encoded directly on prophage sequences. These findings suggest that prophages are infrequently associated with the AMR genes in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754698

Transcription initiation was dispensable for de novo and steady-state histone acetylation at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. However, at steady state, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. These results demonstrate that deposition of specific histone modifications at TSSs is not dependent on transcription and that transcription limits the maintenance of these marks.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Downstream brain regions that depend on a steady supply of information from a neural population subject to this representational drift face a challenge: they must stabilise their readout using only statistical regularities in neural activity. Recent studies have described how representational drift induces deterioration in the accuracy of fixed decoders. Here, we highlight that while a variety of underlying statistics of drift at the level of individual neurons can produce comparable deterioration of a fixed decoder, these different statistics result in dramatically different deterioration rates in adaptive decoders. We describe an adaptive decoding strategy that can read out from a model drifting population long after fixed decoders degrade completely, and demonstrate that in simulated models this strategy is better-suited to heavy-tailed drift statistics, in which individual neurons make sudden and large changes in tuning. We investigate the extent to which these advantageous statistics manifest in experimental in-vivo measurements of drift by considering two existing and well-studied datasets that observe drift in the posterior parietal cortex and the visual cortex. We find preliminary support for sudden jumps in neural tuning that would allow a downstream observer to more easily distinguish changes in representation from noise. These observations are a step towards refining the larger picture of mechanisms underpinning the robustness of information transfer between brain regions that can function in spite of changes in representation driven both by drift and by the learning of new information.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Despite their growing application, a significant challenge remains in ensuring the reproducibility of GEMs, primarily due to inconsistent reporting and inadequate model documentation of model results. Addressing this gap, we introduce FROG analysis, a community driven initiative aimed at standardizing reproducibility assessments of CBMs and GEMs. The FROG framework encompasses four key analyses including Flux variability, Reaction deletion, Objective function, and Gene deletion to produce standardized, numerically reproducible FROG reports. These reports serve as reference datasets, enabling model evaluators, curators, and independent researchers to verify the reproducibility of GEMs systematically. BioModels, a leading repository of systems biology models, has integrated FROG analysis into its curation workflow, enhancing the reproducibility and reusability of submitted GEMs. In our study evaluating 65 GEM submissions from the community, approximately 40% reproduced without intervention, 28% requiring minor adjustments, and 32% needing input from authors. The standardization introduced by FROG analysis facilitated the detection and resolution of issues, ultimately leading to the successful reproduction of all models. By establishing a standardized and comprehensive approach to evaluating GEM reproducibility, FROG analysis significantly contributes to making CBMs and GEMs more transparent, reusable, and reliable for the broader scientific community.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Here, we investigate how beta-arrestins direct location-biased signaling of the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R). Using novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) conformational biosensors and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity reporters, we reveal that in response to the endogenous agonist Angiotensin II and the beta-arrestin-biased agonist TRV023, beta-arrestin 1 and beta-arrestin 2 adopt distinct conformations across different subcellular locations, which are intricately linked to differential ERK activation profiles. We also uncover a population of receptor-free catalytically activated beta-arrestins in the plasma membrane that exhibits insensitivity to different agonists and promotes ERK activation on the plasma membrane independent of G proteins. These findings deepen our understanding of GPCR signaling complexity and also highlight the nuanced roles of beta-arrestins beyond traditional G protein pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Integration of both methodologies has resulted in the development of electrophilic degraders where recruitment of a suitable E3 ubiquitin ligase is achieved through formation of a covalent bond with a cysteine nucleophile. Expanding the scope of electrophilic degraders requires the development of electrophiles with tempered reactivity that enable selective ligase recruitment and reduce cross-reactivity with other cellular nucleophiles. In this study, we report the use of chemical moieties that enable nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions in the rational design of electrophilic protein degraders. Appending an SNAr covalent warhead to several preexisting small molecule inhibitors transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a defined E3 ligase recruiter. The SNAr covalent warhead is versatile; it can recruit various E3 ligases, including DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 11 (DCAF11), DDB1 and CUL4 associated factor 16 (DCAF16), and possibly others. The incorporation of an SNAr covalent warhead into the BRD4 inhibitor led to the discovery of degraders with low picomolar degradation potency.

Each sleep stage, such as NREM and REM, has distinct rhythms, making it even harder for models trained on awake tasks to generalise and decode memory replay during sleep. To overcome this, we developed the Sleep Interpreter (SI), an artificial neural network. We first collected a large EEG dataset from 135 participants, recording brain activity during both awake tasks and overnight sleep. Using a Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) technique with 15 pairs of auditory cues and visual images, we tracked when specific memories were reactivated during sleep. The SI model was then trained separately for NREM and REM stages, using contrastive learning to align neural patterns between wakefulness and sleep while filtering out the background rhythms that previously hindered decoding. We also examined how specific sleep rhythms, such as slow oscillations and their coupling with spindles, influenced decoding performance. In a 15-way classification task during sleep, our model achieved a Top-1 accuracy of up to 40.05% on unseen subjects, surpassing all other available decoding models. Finally, we developed a real-time sleep decoding system by integrating an online automatic sleep staging process with the SI model for each sleep stage. This ability to decode brain activity during sleep opens new avenues for exploring the functional roles of sleep. By making our dataset and decoding system publicly available, we provide a valuable resource for advancing research into sleep, memory, and related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

KIFC1 was identified as a new interaction partner and phosphorylation substrate of AURKA at S349 and T359. In addition, KIFC1 interacted with both, AURKA and TPX2, in an RNA-dependent manner. Our data suggest a riboregulation of mitotic protein-protein interactions during spindle assembly, offering new perspectives on the control of cell division processes by RNA-protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

The Gillespie algorithm, a widely used stochastic simulation method, is pervasively employed to model these systems. However, this algorithm typically assumes that DNA is homogeneously distributed through- out the nucleus, which is not realistic. In this study, we evaluated whether stochastic simulations based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity can accurately capture the dynamics of gene regulation. Our findings indicate that when transcription factors diffuse slowly, these simulations fail to accurately capture gene expression, highlighting the necessity to account for spatial heterogeneity. However, incorporating spatial heterogeneity considerably increases computational time. To address this, we explored various stochastic quasi-steady-state approximations (QSSAs) that simplify the model and reduce simulation time. While both the stochastic total quasi-steady state approximation (stQSSA) and the stochastic low-state quasi-steady-state approximation (slQSSA) reduced simulation time, only the slQSSA provided an accurate model reduction. Our study underscores the importance of utilizing appropriate methods for efficient and accurate stochastic simulations of gene regulatory dynamics, especially when incorporating spatial heterogeneity.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Metabolic cues are particularly potent regulators of sleep, allowing animals to alter their sleep timing and amount depending on food availability and foraging duration. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, suppresses sleep in response to acute food deprivation, presumably to forage for food. This process is dependent on a single pair of Lateral Horn Leucokinin (LHLK) neurons, that secrete the neuropeptide Leucokinin. These neurons signal to insulin producing cells and suppress sleep under periods of starvation. The identification of individual neurons that modulate sleep-metabolism interactions provides the opportunity to examine the cellular changes associated with sleep modulation. Here, we use single-cell sequencing of LHLK neurons to examine the transcriptional responses to starvation. We validate that a Patch-seq approach selectively isolates RNA from individual LHLK neurons. Single-cell CEL-Seq comparisons of LHLK neurons between fed and 24-hr starved flies identified 24 genes that are differentially expressed in accordance with starvation state. In total, 12 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes were identified. Gene-ontology analysis showed an enrichment for Attacins, a family of anti-microbial peptides, along with a number of transcripts with diverse roles in regulating cellular function. Targeted knockdown of differentially expressed genes identified multiple genes that function within LHLK neurons to regulate sleep-metabolism interactions. Functionally validated genes include an essential role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase insomniac, the sorbitol dehydrogenase Sodh1, as well as AttacinC and AttacinB in starvation-induced sleep suppression. Taken together, these findings provide a pipeline for identifying novel regulators of sleep-metabolism interactions within individual neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Such reactivation can be triggered by targeted memory reactivation (TMR), a technique in which a tone previously associated with a memory during wake is re-presented during subsequent sleep. Prior work has shown that TMR in REM reduces arousal responses to negative stimuli. The present study builds on this by measuring autonomic responses and brain activity as well as behaviour. Participants rated the arousal of 48 affective images, paired with semantically matching sounds. Half of these sounds were cued during REM in the subsequent overnight sleep cycle. Participants rated the images in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner with pulse oximetry 48 hours after encoding, and again after two weeks. Results showed that TMR during REM was also associated with reduced brain activity in the two primary nodes of the Salience Network (SN): the Anterior Insula and dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC), as well as the orbitofrontal cortex, subgenual cingulate, and left amygdala, all of which are known to be important for emotional processing. TMR markedly reduced the emotional heart rate deceleration (HRD) response, and also reduced subjective arousal ratings for highly arousing images, while increasing ratings for less arousing images. We conclude that REM TMR can facilitate a decrease in physiological and neurological responses to arousal. These findings have potential implications for the use of TMR in treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Genetic effects on gene expression have been extensively characterized by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, yet data from non-European populations is limited. This restricts our understanding of disease to genes whose regulatory variants are common in European populations. While previous work has leveraged data from multiple populations to improve GWAS power and polygenic risk score (PRS) accuracy, multi-ancestry data has not yet been used to better estimate cis-genetic effects on gene expression. Here, we present a new method, Multi-Ancestry Gene Expression Prediction Regularized Optimization (MAGEPRO), which constructs robust genetic models of gene expression in understudied populations or cell types by fitting a regularized linear combination of eQTL summary data across diverse cohorts. In simulations, our tool generates more accurate models of gene expression than widely-used LASSO and the state-of-the-art multi-ancestry PRS method, PRS-CSx, adapted to gene expression prediction. We attribute this improvement to the ability of MAGEPRO to more accurately estimate causal eQTL effect sizes (p<3.98x10^(-4), two-sided paired t-test). With real data, we applied MAGEPRO to 8 eQTL cohorts representing 3 ancestries (average n=355) and consistently outperformed each of 6 competing methods in gene expression prediction tasks. Integration with GWAS summary statistics across 66 complex traits (representing 22 phenotypes and 3 ancestries) resulted in 2,331 new gene-trait associations, many of which replicate across multiple ancestries, including PHTF1 linked to white blood cell count, a gene which is overexpressed in leukemia patients. MAGEPRO also identified biologically plausible novel findings, such as PIGB, an essential component of GPI biosynthesis, associated with heart failure, which has been previously evidenced by clinical outcome data. Overall, MAGEPRO is a powerful tool to enhance inference of gene regulatory effects in underpowered datasets and has improved our understanding of population-specific and shared genetic effects on complex traits.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754699

The cellular UndP pool is shared by other polysaccharide synthesis pathways and in peptidoglycan (PG) biogenesis. Disruptions in cytosolic polysaccharide synthesis steps are detrimental to bacterial survival due to affecting UndP recycling. In contrast, bacteria can survive disruptions in the periplasmic steps, suggesting a tolerance mechanism to mitigate UndP sequestration. Here we investigated tolerance mechanisms to disruptions of polymerases that are involved in UndP-releasing steps in two related polysaccharide synthesis pathways: the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and the O antigen (OAg), in Escherichia coli and Shigella flexneri. Our study reveals that polysaccharide polymerisation is crucial for efficient UndP recycling. In E. coli K-12, cell survival upon disruptions in OAg polymerase is dependent on a functional ECA synthesis pathway and vice versa. This is because disruptions in OAg synthesis leads to the redirection of the shared lipid-linked sugar substrate UndPP-GlcNAc towards increased ECA production. Conversely, in S. flexneri, the OAg polymerase is essential due to its limited ECA production, which inadequately redirects UndP flow to support cell survival. We propose a model whereby sharing the initial sugar intermediate UndPP-GlcNAc between the ECA and OAg synthesis pathways allows UndP to be redirected towards ECA production, mitigating sequestration issues caused by disruptions in the OAg pathway. These findings suggest an evolutionary buffering mechanism that enhances bacterial survival when UndP sequestration occurs due to stalled polysaccharide biosynthesis, which may allow polysaccharide diversity in the species to increase over time.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Circulating IL-6 was 100-fold higher in OT-PDACIL6 than in OT-PDACparental mice. OT-PDACIL6 tumors were present at 5 days post-implantation, and undetectable by 10 days post implantation. Flow cytometry revealed increased T cells and NK cells, and decreased T regulatory cells in OT-PDACIL6 as compared to OT-PDACparental tumors. Increased lymphoid aggregates were apparent by histological assessment and may account for elevated T cell content. Antibody-based depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prevented tumor clearance and significantly reduced survival of OT-PDACIL6 mice. The anti-tumor immune response to OT-PDACIL6 rendered mice immune to re-challenge with OT-PDACparental tumors.

Here, we show that resting T cells exhibit a bimodal distribution in buoyant mass, which is not captured by surface marker based canonical immunophenotypes or physical parameters such as volume, density, dry mass, or light scattering. Functionally, we demonstrate that T cells with lower buoyant mass exhibit reduced proliferation, tend towards effector differentiation, and become more exhausted in the presence of innate tumor-secreted factors. Conversely, T cells with higher buoyant mass show greater memory potential and resistance to exhaustion.

To uncover clinically translatable mechanisms of psychopathology, it is critical to define how the spatial organization of these networks relates to genetic risk during development. Objective: To determine the relationship between transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence. Design: The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 21 collection sites across the United States. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of ABCD baseline data, collected 2017-2018. Setting: The ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site community-based study. Participants: The sample is largely recruited through school systems. Exclusion criteria included severe sensory, intellectual, medical, or neurological issues that interfere with protocol and scanner contraindications. Split-half subsets were used for cross-validation, matched on age, ethnicity, family structure, handedness, parental education, site, sex, and anesthesia exposure. Exposures: Polygenic risk scores of transdiagnostic genetic factors F1 (PRS-F1) and F2 (PRS-F2) derived from adults in Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobanks datasets. PRS-F1 indexes liability for common psychiatric symptoms and disorders related to mood disturbance; PRS-F2 indexes liability for rarer forms of mental illness characterized by mania and psychosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: (1) P-factor derived from bifactor models of youth- and parent-reported mental health assessments. (2) Person-specific functional brain network topography derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. Results: Total participants included 11,873 youths ages 9-10 years old; 5,678 (47.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 9.92 (0.62) years. PFN topography was found to be heritable (N=7,459, 57.06% of vertices h2 pFDR<0.05, mean h2=0.35). PRS-F1 was associated with p-factor (N=5,815, r=0.12, 95% CI [0.09--0.15], p<0.001).

To overcome this limitation, we have developed a genetically encoded fluorescent protein-based biosensor for malonyl-CoA that can be used to capture malonyl-CoA dynamics in single cells. This biosensor, termed Malibu (malonyl-CoA intracellular biosensor to understand dynamics), exhibits an excitation-ratiometric change in response to malonyl-CoA binding. We first used Malibu to monitor malonyl-CoA dynamics during inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis using cerulenin in E. coli, observing an increase in Malibu response in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In HeLa cells, we used Malibu to monitor the impact of fatty acid biosynthesis inhibition on malonyl-CoA dynamics in single cells, finding that two inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthesis, cerulenin and orlistat, which inhibit different steps of fatty acid biosynthesis, increase malonyl-CoA levels.

Here, we model how discrimination ability in one partner coevolves with cooperativeness in the other and analyse the resulting evolutionary trajectories in the mutualism-antagonism continuum. We show that strong ecological change, such as a radical host shift or colonisation of a new environment, can trigger transitions in both directions including back-and-forth transitions between antagonism and mutualism. Moreover, we find an evolutionary tipping point: a stable mutualism may break down to antagonism if the cost of either mutualistic service or discrimination ability gradually increases above a threshold beyond which this transition cannot be reversed by reducing costs again.

Psilocybin induces dose-dependent transient (4-6 hours) usually pleasant changes in perception, cognition, and emotion by non-selectively agonizing the 5-HT2A receptors and negatively regulating serotonin reuptake, and long-term positive antidepressant effect on mood and well-being. Long-term effects are ascribed to the psychological quality of the acute experience, increase in synaptodensity and temporary (1-week) down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors. Electroencephalography, a non-invasive neuroimaging tool, can track the acute effects of psilocybin; these include the suppression of alpha activity, decreased global connectivity, and increased brain entropy (i.e. brain signal diversity) in eyes-closed resting-state. However, few studies investigated how these modalities are affected together through the psychedelic experience. The current research aimed to evaluate the psilocybin intoxication temporal EEG profile. 20 healthy individuals (10 women) underwent oral administration of psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg ) as part of a placebo-controlled cross-over study, resting-state 5-minute eyes closed EEG was obtained at baseline and 1, 1.5, 3, 6, and 24 hours after psilocybin administration. Absolute power, relative power spectral density (PSD), power envelope global functional connectivity (GFC), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZ), and a Complexity via State-Space Entropy Rate (CSER) were obtained together with measures of subjective intensity of experience. Absolute power decreased in alpha and beta band, but increased in delta and gamma frequencies. 24h later was observed a broadband decrease. The PSD showed a decrease in alpha occipitally between 1 and 3 hours and a decrease in beta frontally at 3 hours, but power spectra distribution stayed the same 24h later. The GFC showed decrease acutely at 1, 1.5, and 3 hours in the alpha band. LZ and showed an increase at 1 and 1.5 hours.

Further, complexity over a source space showed opposing changes in the Default Mode Network (DMN) and visual network between conditions, suggesting a relationship between signal complexity, stimulus integration, and perception of self. In an exploratory attempt, we found that a change in gamma GFC in DMN correlates with oceanic boundlessness. Psychological effects of psilocybin may be wrapped in personal interpretations and history unrelated to underlying neurobiological changes, but changes to perception of self may be bound to perceived loss of boundary based on whole brain synchrony with the DMN in higher frequency bands.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754699

To extract cognitive dynamics at the single-trial level, we applied cognitive dynamics estimation, a recently developed method that generates whole-brain activation maps for four cognitive dimensions (emotion processing, selective attention, self-referential thought, and working memory) using a meta-analytic platform. We then performed C-DSA to calculate the difference between internal and external attention for each cognitive dimension. C-DSA revealed significant differences between internal/external attention in all cognitive dimensions, but especially in emotion processing. Moreover, the difference between attention conditions of selective attention was negatively associated with the severity of depression and state-anxiety, but positively associated with trait-anxiety. Our findings suggest that C-DSA applies to both naturalistic and controlled dynamic processes and may be valuable in clinical settings by linking dynamic cognitive mechanisms with issues like ageing and psychiatric disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Here, we utilized an optogenetic approach to investigate the claustrum's influence on neuronal activity within the dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC) of mice. We conducted two-photon calcium imaging to assess dPFC cell responses during exposure to visual stimuli and widefield photostimulation of claustrum axons embedded in the dPFC. We identified three distinct subpopulations of neurons - sensory responsive, opto responsive, and opto-boosted cells - each exhibiting unique response dynamics to combined visual and optogenetic stimuli. Our findings reveal that stimulation of claustrum axons can normalize neuronal responsiveness, while enhancing neural variability, and significantly increasing network homogeneity. Training in a Pavlovian task showed that while enhanced variability with claustrum axon stimulation in neural responses persists, training does not further increase this variability but instead leads to greater network homogeneity. Additionally, we also performed claustrum axon silencing experiments that revealed that the claustrum may operate bidirectionally to maintain enhanced variability and homogeneity in the prefrontal cortex. These results highlight the crucial role of the claustrum in dynamically modulating dPFC activity, impacting both neuronal variability and network synchronization.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Our results reveal the kinetics of factor association with the ribosome and, among other things, highlight the respective antagonistic roles of IF2 and IF3 in the process. Importantly, our comparisons of in vivo binding kinetics of the two naturally occurring isoforms of IF2 reveal that the longer IF2 isoform directly interacts with the transcriptional factor NusA, a finding further corroborated by pull-down and cross-linking experiments. We further show that cells with compromised binding between IF2 and NusA display slow adaptation to new growth conditions. Taken together, these results suggest a novel coupling mechanism between transcription and translation initiation, important for the rewiring of the transcriptome during a shift of growth media.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

The functionality of these anchors is influenced by the residence time of CTCF on chromatin, which is determined by its binding affinity and its interactions with nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated factors. In this study, we demonstrate that CTCF occupancy is driven by CTCF motifs strategically positioned at the entry sites of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that, upon binding, the N-terminus of CTCF is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF priming nucleosome (CpN). CTCF recognizes its binding sites if they are not methylated. It can then displace the CpN, provided the nucleosome is not marked by CpG methylation or repressive histone modifications. Under these permissive conditions, the N-terminus of CTCF recruits SMARCA5 to reposition the CpN downstream, thereby creating nucleosome-free regions that enhance CTCF occupancy and cohesin stalling. In contrast, when CpNs carry repressive epigenetic marks, CTCF binding is transient, without nucleosome displacement or chromatin opening. In such cases, cohesin is not effectively retained at CTCF binding sites. We propose that the epigenetic status of CpNs governs cell-specific CTCF binding patterns, ensuring the maintenance of chromatin architecture throughout the cell cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the ability to recover co-occurrence estimates using standard and penalised likelihood under varying sample size and interaction scenarios while increasing model complexity in two dimensions: the number of interacting species and the number of covariates. We demonstrate that the ability to quantify interactions in species occupancy using these models is highly sensitive to sample size and interaction strength. Even in the simplest scenario, there is high bias and low coverage in natural parameters (used for inference) for sample sizes below 400 sites. Strong co-occurrence is detected consistently above 400 sites, but weak co-occurrence is never consistently detected even with 3000 sites. We demonstrate that mean predictive ability is less affected by sample size and complexity, with low bias in derived probabilities at 100 sites.

Goal-directed learning arises from a distributed neural circuit including the prefrontal, posterior parietal and temporal cortices. However, the role of cortico-cortical functional interactions remains unclear. To tackle this question, we combined information decomposition theory with human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and studied whether and how learning signals are encoded through neural interactions. Our findings revealed that  information gain - or the decrease in uncertainty regarding the causal relationship between an action and its consequence - is represented within a distributed cortical network, incorporating the visual, parietal, lateral prefrontal, and ventromedial/orbital prefrontal cortices. Remarkably, cortico-cortical interactions encoded information gain in a synergistic manner, beyond what individual regions represented alone. Synergistic interactions encoded information gain at the level of pairwise and higher-order relations, such as triplets and quadruplets. Higher-order synergistic interactions were characterised by long-range relations gravitating over the ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortices, which played a receiving role in the broadcasting of information gain over cortical circuits. Overall, the current study provides evidence that information gain is encoded in both synergistic and higher-order functional interactions, as well as through the broadcasting of information gain signals toward the prefrontal reward circuitry. Moreover, our research offers a new perspective on how information relevant to cognition is encoded and broadcasted within distributed cortical networks and brain-wide dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Central to GCE is the development of orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs wherein engineered aaRSs recognize chosen ncAAs and charge them onto tRNAs that decode blank codons (e.g., the amber stop codon). Many orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs covering a wide range of ncAAs have been generated by directed evolution, yet the evolution of new aaRS/tRNA pairs by standard strategies remains a labor-intensive process that often produces aaRS/tRNA pairs with suboptimal ncAA incorporation efficiencies. In this study, we present a strategy for evolving aaRSs that leverages OrthoRep to drive their continuous hypermutation in yeast. We demonstrate our strategy in 8 independent aaRS evolution campaigns starting from 4 different aaRS/tRNA parents targeting 7 distinct ncAAs. We observed the rapid evolution of multiple novel aaRSs capable of incorporating an overall range of 13 ncAAs tested into proteins in response to the amber codon. Some evolved systems reached efficiencies for amber codon-specified ncAA-dependent translation comparable to translation with natural amino acids specified by sense codons in yeast. Additionally, we discovered a surprising aaRS that evolved to self-regulate its own expression for greater dependency on ncAAs for translation. These findings demonstrate the potential of OrthoRep-driven aaRS evolution platforms in supporting the continued growth of GCE technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

However, the strategies these cells invoke to cope under low iron conditions and the extent to which they are responsible for new production (i.e., the fraction of primary production supported by nutrients from outside of the euphotic zone) is unclear. Here, we examine how a representative picoeukaryote, the chlorophyte Bathycoccus sp., recently isolated from the iron-limited subarctic North Pacific Ocean, responds to iron limitation and quantify its potential contribution to carbon export. Iron-limited Bathycoccus exhibits reductions in cellular growth rate, volume, and carbon and nitrogen quotas along with a restructuring of cellular metabolism. Gene expression and pathway analyses show evidence of cellular strategies to mitigate iron limitation but constitutive expression of genes related to nitrogen uptake and utilization. Additionally, when grown on nitrate, cellular carbon and nitrogen quotas ranged from 0.02 to 0.17 pmol C cell-1 and 3.3 x 10-3 to 2.2 x 10-2 pmol N cell-1, respectively, as a function of iron status. Based on the measured cellular quotas, we estimate that representative picoeukaryotes, such as Bathycoccus, in HNLC North Pacific waters can account for a majority of new production under ambient iron limited conditions, supporting the need for a paradigm shift in our thinking of the role small eukaryotic phytoplankton play in the global carbon cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Although aPKC-Par6 can phosphorylate Lgl at three serine sites to exclude it from the apical domain, paradoxically, aPKC-Par6 and Lgl can also form a stable kinase-substrate complex whose function remains unclear and with conflicting roles proposed for Par6. We report the structure of human aPKC{iota}-Par6 bound to full-length Llgl1, captured through an aPKC{iota} docking site and a Par6 PDZ contact. This soluble tripartite complex traps a phospho-S663 Llgl1 intermediate bridging between aPKC and Par6, impeding phosphorylation progression. Thus, aPKC{iota} is effectively inhibited by Llgl1pS663 whilst Llgl1 is captured by aPKC{iota}-Par6. Mutational disruption of Lgl-aPKC interaction impedes complex assembly and Lgl phosphorylation, whereas disrupting the Lgl-Par6PDZ contact promotes complex dissociation and completion of Lgl phosphorylation cycle. We incorporate these findings into a Par6 PDZ-regulated substrate capture-and-release model that we demonstrate requires binding by Cdc42-GTP and the apical partner Crumbs to drive complex disassembly.

Not only must these materials reach the appropriate cellular locale fully intact and in therapeutically relevant concentrations, they must also retain activity upon arrival. The question of residual activity is especially critical when delivery involves exposure to the late endocytic pathway, whose acidic lumenal environment can denature and/or degrade internalized material. ZF5.3 is a compact, stable, rationally designed mini-protein that efficiently escapes intact from late endocytic vesicles, with or without covalently linked protein cargo. Here, using insights from mechanistic studies on the pathway of endosomal escape and classic knowledge regarding the bioinorganic chemistry of zinc(II) coordination in small proteins, we re-designed the sequence of ZF5.3 to successfully alter the timing (but not the efficiency) of endosomal escape. The new mini-protein we describe, AV5.3, escapes earlier than ZF5.3 along the endocytic pathway with no loss in efficiency, with or without enzyme cargo. More importantly, earlier endosomal escape translates into higher enzymatic activity upon arrival in the cytosol. Delivery of the pH-sensitive protein dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) with AV5.3 results in substantial catalytic activity in the cytosol, whereas delivery with ZF5.3 does not. The activity of AV5.3-DHFR upon delivery is sufficient to rescue a genetic DHFR deletion in CHO cells. This work provides evidence that programmed trafficking through the endosomal pathway is a viable strategy for the efficient cytosolic delivery of therapeutic proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), possesses a complex cell envelope that determines many of the key physiologic and virulence properties that facilitate infection, which comprises multiple classes of unique lipids. The macrophage phagosome is a key reservoir of infection in pulmonary TB and multiple studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) is limiting in this environment. The ability of Mtb to sense and respond to phosphate starvation is required for virulence in animal models and replication in human macrophages in vitro. Here, we show that during Pi restriction the Mtb lipidome is markedly remodelled such that phospholipids are replaced with multiple classes of phosphorus-free lipids, some of which have not been documented before. Further, we discover that Mtb can metabolise phospholipid polar heads derived from host pulmonary surfactant as an alternative phosphate source, which sustains cell division for several generations during Pi restriction. These dual manipulations of phospholipid metabolism provide Mtb with an escape from phosphate restriction specific to the infection of alveolar macrophages, one of the earliest steps in establishing pulmonary tuberculosis. The changes in envelope lipidome remodelling, akin to that observed in some marine and terrestrial bacteria suggests that standard Mtb culture conditions that use media with high concentrations of Pi do not reflect the physiologic environment during infection, thereby potentially undermining vaccine and drug development for tuberculosis. Moreover, the distinct Mtb phosphate-free lipids and the metabolic pathways that generate them could provide new antibiotic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

KCNC1 encodes Kv3.1, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit that is highly and selectively expressed in neurons capable of generating action potentials at high frequency, including parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in cerebral cortex (PV-INs) known to be important for cognitive function and plasticity as well as control of network excitation to prevent seizures.

Our results indicate that global heterozygous expression of the A421V variant leads to epilepsy and premature lethality.

A novel RNA-binding protein, Pro-rich Coiled-coil Containing Protein 2B (PRRC2B), has been reported by multiple laboratories to mediate uORF-dependent and independent regulation of translation initiation required for cell cycle progression and proliferation. We identified two alternative spliced isoforms in human and mouse hearts and HEK293T cells, full-length (FL) and exon 16-excluded isoform {triangleup}E16. A congenital heart disease-associated human mutation-mimicry knock-in of the equivalent variant in the mouse genome leads to the depletion of the full-length Prrc2b mRNA but not the alternative spliced truncated form {triangleup}E16, does not cause any apparent structural or functional disorders. In contrast, global genetic inactivation of the PRRC2B gene in the mouse genome, nullifying both mRNA isoforms, caused patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and neonatal lethality in mice. Bulk and single nucleus transcriptome profiling analyses of embryonic mouse hearts demonstrated a significant overall downregulation of multiple smooth muscle-specific genes in Prrc2b mutant mice resulting from reduced smooth muscle cell number. Integrated analysis of proteomic changes in Prrc2b null mouse embryonic hearts and polysome-seq and RNA-seq multi-omics analysis in human HEK293T cells uncover conserved PRRC2B-regulated target mRNAs that encode essential factors required for cardiac and vascular development. Our findings reveal the connection between alternative splicing regulation of PRRC2B, PRRC2B-mediated translational control, and congenital cardiovascular development and disorder. This study may shed light on the significance of PRRC2B in human cardiovascular disease diagnosis and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754699

Prior work showed that coccidioidomycosis cases in California sharply increase by nearly 2-fold following wet winters that occur one- and two-years following drought. Statewide drought between 2020-2022 followed by heavy precipitation during the 2022-2023 winter raised concerns over potential increases in coccidioidomycosis cases in the fall of 2023, prompting California Department of Public Health (CDPH) to issue public health alerts. As anticipated, California saw a near record number of cases in 2023, with 9,054 provisional cases reported. During the 2023-2024 California wet season, precipitation was 115% the long-term average, furthering concerns about continued high coccidioidomycosis risk. We developed an ensemble model to forecast coccidioidomycosis cases in California in 2024-2025. Using this model, we predicted a total of 11,846 cases (90% PI: 10,056-14,094) in California between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, encompassing the preliminary state report of 10,593. Our model forecasted 12,244 cases statewide between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 -- a 62% increase over the cases reported during the same period two years prior, and on par with the high incidence seen in 2023. The Southern San Joaquin Valley (5,398 cases, 90% PI: 4,556-6,442), Southern Coast (3,322, 90% PI: 2,694-3,961), and Central Coast (1,207 cases, 90% PI: 867-1,585) regions are expected to see the largest number of infections. Our model forecasts that disease incidence will exhibit pronounced seasonality, particularly in endemic regions, with cases rising in June and peaking in November at 1,411 (90% PI: 815-2,172) cases statewide - 98% higher than the peak two years prior (714) and nearly as high as the peak in 2023 (1,462). Near-term forecasts have the potential to inform public health messaging to enhance provider and patient awareness, encourage risk reduction practices, and improve recognition and management of coccidioidomycosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754699

ME/CFS diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME/CFS patients' low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n<100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME/CFS cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME/CFS status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME/CFS cases' restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME/CFS status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME/CFS status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the 'healthy volunteer' selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME/CFS diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754699

In cell culture this can occur by the induction of intercellular membrane connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures (TLSs), which are capable of trafficking the viral genome between cells. Here, we showed that TLSs are present at the site of IAV infections in vivo, and then used in vitro models to ask how IAVs induce their formation. We found that TLS induction cannot be induced by cytokine signalling from infected to uninfected cells, but requires IAV replication within cells. IAV replication can form filamentous virions with structural similarities to TLSs, but we found that TLS induction is independent of virion morphology. We therefore looked at the intracellular responses to infection. Using a pan-caspase inhibitor, we found that TLS induction by IAVs requires the onset of apoptosis. Our results, which suggest that IAVs control their ability to spread directly from cell to cell by driving infected cells into apoptosis, identifies a new way in which a virus can manipulate its host to evade antiviral immune responses.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome.

As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs.

Duplicated genes expanded uniquely in the human lineage likely contributed to brain evolution, including the increased complexity of synaptic connections between neurons and the dramatic expansion of the neocortex. Discovering duplicate genes is challenging because the similarity of paralogs makes them prone to sequence-assembly errors. To mitigate this issue, we analyzed a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome sequence (T2T-CHM13) and identified 213 duplicated gene families likely containing human-specific paralogs (>98% identity). Positing that genes important in universal human brain features should exist with at least one copy in all modern humans and exhibit expression in the brain, we narrowed in on 362 paralogs with at least one copy across thousands of ancestrally diverse genomes and present in human brain transcriptomes. Of these, 38 paralogs co-express in gene modules enriched for autism-associated genes and potentially contribute to human language and cognition. We narrowed in on 13 duplicate gene families with human-specific paralogs that are fixed among modern humans and show convincing brain expression patterns. Using long-read DNA sequencing revealed hidden variation across 200 modern humans of diverse ancestries, uncovering signatures of selection not previously identified, including possible balancing selection of CD8B. To understand the roles of duplicated genes in brain development, we generated zebrafish CRISPR ""knockout"" models of nine orthologs and transiently introduced mRNA-encoding paralogs, effectively ""humanizing"" the larvae. Morphometric, behavioral, and single-cell RNA-seq screening highlighted, for the first time, a possible role for GPR89B in dosage-mediated brain expansion and FRMPD2B function in altered synaptic signaling, both hallmark features of the human brain.

Here, we characterize calcium activity in Langerhans cells, skin-resident macrophages responsible for surveillance and clearance of cellular debris after tissue damage. Langerhans cells reside in the epidermis and extend dynamic dendrites in close proximity to adjacent keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. We find that homeostatic Langerhans cells exhibit spontaneous and transient changes in calcium activity, with calcium flux occurring primarily in the cell body and rarely in the dendrites. Triggering somatosensory axon degeneration increases the frequency of calcium activity in Langerhans cell dendrites. By contrast, we show that Langerhans cells exhibit a sustained increase in intracellular calcium following engulfment of damaged keratinocytes. Altering intracellular calcium activity leads to a decrease in engulfment efficiency of keratinocyte debris.

Mitigation of arboviral outbreaks relies largely on the use of insecticides, but the effectiveness of such responses is threatened by the evolution of insecticide resistance. Monitoring mosquito susceptibility to different insecticides is therefore vital for informed decisions regarding outbreak responses. In this study, we elucidate the patterns of resistance to two insecticide classes within the primary vectors of West Nile virus in the northeast and midwestern regions of the continental United States, Culex pipiens and Culex restuans.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEgg collections were performed throughout Illinois from 2018-2020, and adults were tested for insecticide resistance to permethrin and malathion. Individuals from each sampling location were sequenced to determine the presence of kdr target-site mutations, and biochemical assays were performed to determine increases in detoxification enzymes and insensitive acetylcholinesterase. Results from the bottle assays indicate variable resistance rates in Illinois, however lowered mortality was found in most of the regions that were tested. The kdr mutation (L1014F) was present in 50% of Culex pipiens sequenced, and more prevalent in southern Illinois compared with northern and central (p < 0.001). Different mechanisms were predictive of resistance by species and insecticide, with permethrin resistance being affected by kdr-allele frequency and oxidase levels and malathion resistance by - and {beta}-esterases in Cx. pipiens. For Cx. restuans -esterase and oxidase levels were predictive of permethrin resistance while {beta}-esterase and insensitive acetylcholinesterase levels were predictive of malathion resistance.

Conclusions/SignificanceWe documented variation in insecticide resistance levels that appear to be driven by population differences in kdr mutation rates and metabolic resistance mechanisms. The presence of different mechanisms in species and regions has implications for approaches to resistance management and highlights the need to implement and maintain insecticide resistance monitoring practices.

Author SummaryMosquitoes are the vectors of many major diseases including malaria, dengue, yellow fever, zika, and West Nile virus. Insecticides are often used to control mosquitoes and the outbreaks they cause. However, evidence has shown that populations of different mosquito species worldwide have developed resistance to our most common insecticides. This study shows that West Nile virus vectors in Illinois, (Culex pipiens and Culex restuans) are no exception to this trend. Egg collections were made throughout the state during the 2018-2020 field seasons and the resulting adults were tested for resistance to two common insecticides using the CDCs bottle bioassay protocol. The results indicate that rates of resistance vary throughout the state and population differences in resistance mechanisms are driving this variation.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Here, we investigated how the low-dimensional organization of intrinsic functional connectivity patterns based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging relates to brain energy expenditure measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. By incrementally adding more dimensions of brain organization (via functional gradients), we were able to show that increasing amounts of variance in the map of brain energy expenditure could be accounted for. In particular, the brain organization dimensions that explained a large amount of the variance in intrinsic brain function also explained a large amount of the regional variance in the energy expenditure maps. This was particularly true for brain organization maps based on the strongest connections, suggesting that ""weak"" connections may not explain as much energy variance. Notably, our topological model was more effective than random brain organization configurations, suggesting that brain organization may be specifically associated with energy optimization. Finally, using brain asymmetry as a model for metabolic efficiency, we found that optimizing energy expenditure independently in each hemisphere outperformed non-independent optimization. This supports the concept of hemispheric competition rather than lateralization in energy allocation. Our results demonstrate how the spatial organization of functional connections is systematically linked to optimized energy expenditure in the human brain, providing new insights into the metabolic basis of brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Downstream effectors activated by cOAs are typically non-specific proteins that induce damage to essential cellular components, thereby preventing phage epidemics. Due to these toxic effects, it is crucial that the production and concentration of cOAs remain under tight regulatory control during infection-free periods or when deactivating the immune response after clearing an infection. Type III CRISPR loci often encode enzymes known as ring nucleases (RNs) that bind and degrade specific cOAs, while some effectors are auto-deactivating. Despite the discovery of several classes of RNs, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of type III CRISPR-Cas loci in this context is lacking. Here, we examined 38,742 prokaryotic genomes to provide a global overview of type III CRISPR loci, focussing on the known and predicted RNs. The candidate RNs Csx16 and Csx20 are confirmed as active enzymes, joining Crn1-3. Distributions and patterns of co-occurrence of RNs and associated effectors are explored, allowing the conclusion that a sizeable majority of type III CRISPR systems regulate cOA levels by degrading the signalling molecules, which has implications for cell fate following viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation.

Based on re-analysis of three pre-existing perceptual choice datasets, the authors claim that application of a deconvolution method designed to account for the overlap of stimulus- and response-aligned components, eliminates key signatures of evidence accumulation from the CPP measured in response-aligned average waveforms. From this the authors conclude that these apparent signatures were an artifact of component overlap and that the CPP may not trace evidence accumulation. Here, we argue that the analysis and interpretation of these perceptual choice data are critically flawed. First, we demonstrate with simple simulations that the deconvolution method used by the authors is categorically not designed to correctly capture evidence accumulation signals and, consequently, cannot reliably determine their presence or absence. Second, even within the parameters of their approach, we highlight that the results presented do not in fact support their claim that deconvolution eliminates evidence accumulation signatures from the CPP. Lastly, we list numerous signatures of evidence accumulation identified in the CPP in previous research, other than the response-aligned average waveform criteria on which the present work narrowly focused.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

We reasoned that while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state an entirely atomic level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding, and given a description of the larger protein context, and builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking. Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a kcat/KM of 11000 M-1min- 1, considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Explosive growth of targeted protein degradation (TPD) drug development has spurred renewed interest in proximity-inducing molecules and especially Molecular Glue Degraders (MGDs). These compounds catalyze destruction of disease-causing proteins by reshaping protein surfaces and promoting cooperative binding between ubiquitylating enzymes and target proteins. MGD discovery for pre-defined targets is a major challenge in contemporary drug discovery. The field is limited by a lack of approaches that can exploit charged ligand-binding pockets, thus excluding a major fraction of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) that evolved to recognize exceedingly common acidic and basic degrons. Here we solve these important chemical challenges through chemocentric MGD discovery of ZZ1, a BET-family protein degrader and a prodrug of a negatively charged glue (c-Glue). ZZ1 activation unmasks a sulfinic acid moiety that binds the modular GID/CTLH ubiquitin ligase complex via a basic pocket in its YPEL5 subunit. YPEL5 is a CRBN structural homolog and an essential non-Cullin ubiquitin ligase cofactor expressed in cancers of the bone marrow. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized capacity of YPEL5 to recruit GID/CTLH substrates, and they provide a powerful strategy to discover c-Glues that induce proximity to ubiquitin ligases with similarly desirable properties.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

There are uncertainties about whether treatments in the acute or post-acute phase of infection can prevent PCC. We report an update to a previous systematic review on the effects of interventions to prevent PCC.

MethodsWe updated our previous peer-reviewed searches on February 9, 2024. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature resources to identify trials and comparative observational studies reporting on any intervention provided during the acute (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or post-acute phase (4-8 weeks) of COVID-19 and our primary outcome of incidence of PCC, ascertained at 3 months or longer following infection and capturing, at a minimum, symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and one or more aspects of cognitive function. Non-recovery from COVID-19 was included if necessary. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, breathlessness/dyspnea, post-exertional malaise, health-related quality of life, psychopathology, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, return to work/education, and adverse effects of the intervention. For screening we employed artificial intelligence to prioritize records and modified our methods to rely on single-reviewer screening after 50% of citations were screened in duplicate. Study selection and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers and data extraction relied on verification of another reviewers work. We grouped studies by intervention type and timing, and by acute-care setting, and performed meta-analysis where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary outcome, excluding studies with high risk of bias, using non-recovery as a proxy outcome, and evaluating the outcome at more than 12 months of follow-up. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

ResultsTwenty-four studies (5 randomized and 19 non-randomized), all among adults, were included. The acute care setting in nine studies was outpatient and in 15 studies was in-patient; all but one intervention was administered during the acute-phase of illness. The use of convalescent plasma in outpatient acute COVID-19 care probably does not reduce the risk of PCC (relative risk [RR]: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.12; 1 RCT; moderate certainty). There was low-certainty evidence suggesting that probiotics (RR [95% CI]: 0.32 [0.13-0.78]; 1 RCT) and metformin (0.50 [0.25-0.99]; 1 RCT among individuals with a BMI [&ge;]25 kg/m2) reduce PCC to a small-to-moderate extent in outpatients, while ivermectin (outpatients), antivirals (outpatients), steroids (in-patients), and therapeutic-dose heparin (vs. prophylactic dose; in-patients) may not be effective. Evidence was very low certainty for several other acute-phase pharmacologic intervention and post-acute outpatient assessment and referrals. For outpatient antiviral treatment, while overall PCC risk may not decrease, there might be a slight reduction in psychopathology. Similarly, inpatient antiviral use may not prevent PCC but may offer a small reduction in prolonged general malaise after light exertion. Therapeutic-dose heparin may slightly reduce the risk of cognitive impairment compared to prophylactic-dose heparin among in-patients. The findings remained consistent across all these sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsEvidence suggests that PCC can be prevented to some extent among outpatients with the use of probiotics and metformin during the acute phase of COVID-19. Effects from interventions used among in-patients and within the post-acute phase are uncertain at this time. Evidence on commonly recommended interventions including rehabilitation or multidisciplinary care was lacking.

Through a CRISPR-based screen, we identified Galvanin, a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein that is required for human neutrophils to change their direction of migration in response to an applied electric field. Our results indicate that Galvanin rapidly relocalizes to the anodal side of a cell on exposure to an electric field, and that the net charge on its extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive this relocalization. The spatial pattern of neutrophil protrusion and retraction changes immediately upon Galvanin relocalization, suggesting that it acts as a direct sensor of the electric field that then transduces spatial information about a cells electrical environment to the migratory apparatus. The apparent mechanism of cell steering by sensor relocalization represents a new paradigm for directed cell migration.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Here, we propose an ""on-demand release"" model, wherein the formation of microvesicles, a specific group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), is the rate-limiting step. A co-culture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, GRABeCB2.0, and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by PKC, DAGL, Arf6, and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors. This ""on demand release"" model, supported by mathematical analysis, offers a cohesive framework for understanding eCB signaling at the molecular level and suggests that microvesicles carrying signaling lipids regulate neuronal functions in parallel to canonical synaptic vesicles.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

While local adaptation does not manifest in obvious morphological changes, population genomic studies can reveal cryptic diversity and provide insights into local adaptive processes. In this study, we investigated the biogeographic history and genomic diversity across the range of the zebra longwing butterfly Heliconius charithonia, a species with a widespread distribution in the Neotropics, but which is phenotypically homogenous across its range. We examined whole genome sequence data from 55 individuals from the eight described subspecies. We infer that there were at least two distinct colonization events of the Caribbean islands from the mainland. The second colonization wave occurred relatively recently, accounting for the genetic homogeneity observed across the species range. Despite low divergence across most of the genome, two large non-recombining genomic regions showed deeply divergent haplotypes that correspond to chromosomal inversions. Phylogenetic analyses indicate ancient origins of these inversion polymorphisms, and there is no evidence that they were introgressed from another extant lineage of Heliconius. These ancient polymorphisms are likely maintained by heterogeneous selection across the landscape, with the inversion on chromosome 19 likely playing a role in local adaptation to cold and desiccation. Our findings underscore the importance of genomic analysis in uncovering hidden diversity and adaptation in phenotypically homogenous species and highlight the significant role of chromosomal inversions in driving local adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Early pterosaurs had long stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered during flight like a flag in the wind. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system used to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Fluctuating temperatures can also influence the patterns of cytosine DNA methylation, thereby influencing gene expression. However, whether these epigenetic changes provide an adaptative advantage remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that DNA methylation is required to regulate thermomorphogenesis. Hypomethylated drm1 drm2 cmt3 mutants or seedlings treated with 5-azacytidine to block DNA methylation exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth at warm temperatures, primarily due to impaired cell elongation. Moreover, DNA hypomethylation compromises auxin biosynthesis and transport in response to warmth, partially by reducing PIF4 protein levels. Notably, the loss of DNA methylation leads to increased expression of SUPPRESSOR OF drm1 drm2 cmt3 (SDC), which in turn restricts hypocotyl elongation during thermomorphogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that DNAme regulates the inhibition of SDC expression to promote gibberellin biosynthesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of DNA methylation in modulating gene expression in response to temperature fluctuations and provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of thermomorphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Using a combination of confocal fluorescence microcopy and immuno-gold electron microscopy, we show that alterations in astrocyte structural features are driven by microglia phagocytosis, as labeled astrocyte membranes are found within microglia phagolysosomes. Inhibition of complement C3-mediated phagocytosis using the neutrophil inhibitory peptide (NIF) rescued astrocyte structure and decreased cocaine seeking behavior following cocaine self-administration and abstinence. Collectively, these results provide evidence for microglia pruning of accumbens astrocytes across cocaine abstinence which mediates cocaine craving.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

However, most existing analyses rely on bulk data or cultured cell lines, which may fail to identify cell-type-specific enhancers and target genes. Recently, single-cell multimodal data measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells have enabled the inference of enhancer-gene pairs in a cell-type-specific and context-specific manner. However, this task is challenged by the data's high sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of enhancer-gene pairs. To address these challenges, we propose scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In systematic analyses of blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power with greater reproducibility across independent datasets and stronger consistency with orthogonal data modalities. Meanwhile, its computational cost is less than 1% of existing methods. When applied to single-cell multimodal data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and controls, scMultiMap gave the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and revealed new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants in microglia.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

In stark contrast to the amassed knowledge concerning the epidermal growth factor receptors themselves, the extracellular dynamics of individual EGFRLs remain elusive. Here, employing fluorescent probes and a tool for triggering ectodomain shedding of EGFRLs, we show that EREG, a low-affinity EGFRL, exhibits the most rapid and efficient activation of EGFR in confluent epithelial cells and mouse epidermis. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) renal epithelial cells, EGFR- and ERK-activation waves propagate during collective cell migration in an ADAM17 sheddase- and EGFRL-dependent manner. Upon induction of EGFRL shedding, radial ERK activation waves were observed in the surrounding receiver cells. Notably, the low-affinity ligands EREG and AREG mediated faster and broader ERK waves than the high-affinity ligands. The integrity of tight/adherens junctions was essential for the propagation of ERK activation, implying that the tight intercellular spaces prefer the low-affinity EGFRL to the high-affinity ligands for efficient signal transmission. To validate this observation in vivo, we generated EREG-deficient mice expressing the ERK biosensor and found that ERK wave propagation and cell migration were impaired during skin wound repair. In conclusion, we have quantitatively demonstrated the distinctions among EGFRLs in shedding, diffusion, and target cell activation in physiological contexts. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of low-affinity EGFRLs in rapid intercellular signal transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Metabolic pathway kinases (VIP1/VIHs) leading to the production of PP-InsPs are now well characterized in yeast and plants. Previously, the wheat inositol pyrophosphate kinase (TaVIH2) was shown to encode a catalytic active kinase domain. Heterologous expression of TaVIH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed enhanced drought tolerance by modulating the cell composition. In this study, we attempted to identify the interacting protein targets of wheat VIH2-3B using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screen, identifying 52 putative interactors that are primarily involved in cell wall-related functions. Notably, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (FLA7), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein emerged as the most frequently interacting partner in the screen. Further analysis using pull-down assays validated the interaction between TaVIH2-3B and TaFLA7 in vivo. Using the reporter fusion studies, we observed the localization of TaFLA7 to be a plasma membrane. We also observed that this localization of the FLA7 was perturbed in the yeast vip1delta strain. The expression of TaVIH2-3B bearing PP-InsP5K enzymatic activity in yeast mutants rescued the localisation of the FLA7 to the membrane. Expression analysis of TaFLA7 showed differential expression response under drought in wheat shoot tissues. TaFLA7 was also found to be highly expressed during grain development, particularly in the endosperm and seed coat during grain maturation. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential role of TaVIH2 in cell wall remodelling and stress response pathways, offering new insights into the functional roles of VIH proteins in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754699

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754699

Here, we identify three families in which variants in the remaining CPLANE subunit CPLANE2/RSG1 also cause ciliopathy. These patients display cleft palate, tongue lobulations and polydactyly, phenotypes characteristic of Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome. We further show that these alleles disrupt two vital steps of ciliogenesis, basal body docking and recruitment of intraflagellar transport proteins.

The biofilm stability is mediated by its matrix built of secreted exopolysaccharides, eDNA, and structural proteins. Exopolysaccharides of P. aeruginosa - Pel, Psl and alginate - have the highest biomedical relevance, but the mechanisms behind their synthesis and secretion are poorly understood. Here, we employ cryogenic electron microscopy to resolve the 2.5 [A] structure of the outer membrane complex PelBC for Pel exopolysaccharide, which is uniquely composed of the membrane-embedded {beta}-barrel PelB and the asymmetrical ring of 12 lipoproteins PelC at the periplasmic interface. The assembly captured in the lipid-based nanodisc is stabilized by electrostatic contacts of PelC with the periplasmic loops of PelB and multiple interactions with PelB N-terminal helical domains. Within the membrane, the resolved acyl chains of the PelC lipoproteins are alternated by the tryptophan residues immersed into the lipid leaflet, thus offering a stable anchoring architecture. The highly anionic interior of the PelB {beta}-barrel is sealed by three loops at the extracellular side, where the short Plug-S loop is aligned with the periplasmic helical scaffold, being the potential gating element for the Pel exopolysaccharide tunneling. Molecular dynamic simulations of PelB in native-like membrane environments suggest that Plug-S is sufficiently flexible to open a tunnel, and so serve as a gate. The gating model is further supported by single-channel conductivity measurements, which identify two conductance states of PelB. Via mutational analysis we confirm that Plug-S mediates opening of a narrow tunnel, as required for the controlled exopolysaccharide transport. Our structural and functional analysis of the pathogenicity-relevant complex offer a detailed and comprehensive view on this unique machinery and suggest the route taken by the exopolysaccharide at the final secretion step.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses.

Moreover, microtubule-accumulated structures like swarming microtubule assemblies are attractive components for dynamic materials, such as active matter and molecular robots. Thus, dynamic control of microtubule superstructures is an important topic. However, implementing stimulus-dependent control of superstructures remains challenging. This challenge can be resolved by developing designer protein approaches. We have previously developed a Tau-derived peptide (TP), which binds to the inner or outer surface of microtubules depending on the timing of the incubation. In this report, we designed the TP-fused photo-switchable protein Dronpa (TP-Dronpa) that reversibly photoconverts between monomeric and tetrameric states to photocontrol microtubule assemblies. The formation of microtubule superstructures, including bundles and doublets, was induced by tetrameric TP-Dronpa, whereas monomeric TP-Dronpa ensured that microtubules remained dispersed. Tetrameric TP-Dronpa also induced motile aster-like structures and swarming movement of microtubules on a kinesin-coated substrate. The formation/dissociation of these microtubule superstructures can be controlled by light irradiation. This system can generate and photocontrol various microtubule superstructures and provides an approach to facilitate the assembly of dynamic materials for various applications.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754700

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

We performed a 48-week double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled decentralized study (Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity [PEARL]; NCT04488601; registration date 2020-07-28) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rapamycin in mitigating clinical signs of aging in a normative aging cohort. Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week. Future work will aim to identify biometric signatures of clinical effectiveness to inform personalized treatment strategies that more broadly maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754700

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

A transdiagnostic factor for psychopathology is emotion regulation, which is influenced by sex hormones, such as estradiol (E2), across the menstrual cycle on the behavioral and neural level. Whether this is also the case in the antepartum period remains unknown. For the first time, behavioral and neural emotion regulation were investigated in healthy primiparous pregnant females with extremely high E2 levels during the second trimester (N = 15) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Results were compared with naturally-cycling females with high E2 levels (after E2-administration, N = 16) and low E2 levels (early follicular phase, N = 16). Although pregnant females reported the lowest trait use of cognitive reappraisal, all females successfully regulated their emotions by applying cognitive reappraisal in the scanner. On the neural level, all females had increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during downregulation of negative emotions. Pregnant females showed no significant differences in functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction, resting-state) related to emotion regulation compared to the nonpregnant group. However, group differences emerged for amygdala activation. In pregnant females, increased amygdala activity predicted reduced regulation success and was positively associated with depression scores. This first fMRI study during pregnancy indicates that depression scores are reflected in heightened amygdala activity already observable in the antepartum period. Thus, through its association with reduced regulation success, increased amygdala activity suggests a neural risk marker for peripartum mental health. Future research needs to investigate emotion regulation in pregnant and postpartum women to further understand pregnancy-related changes and associations of mood, emotional and neural functions. Eventually, this will allow enhanced identification, prevention, and treatment of peri- and postpartum mental ill-health.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754700

We report genome-wide data from 248 ancient individuals from the largely unsampled period 100-800 CE and co-analyze them with previously reported data. In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections.

Method of StudyIn this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage ({gamma}H2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP).

ResultsWhile no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases.

ConclusionsThese findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

C_LI

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

Here, we describe a comprehensive genomic dataset from the first individual, HG008, including DNA from an adherent, epithelial-like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumor cell line (HG008-T) and matched normal cells from duodenal tissue (HG008-N-D) and pancreatic tissue (HG008-N-P). The data come from thirteen whole genome measurement technologies: Illumina paired-end, Element standard and long insert, Ultima UG100, PacBio (HiFi and Onso), Oxford Nanopore (standard and ultra-long), Bionano Optical Mapping, Arima and Phase Genomics Hi-C, G-banded karyotyping, directional genomic hybridization, and BioSkryb Genomics single-cell ResolveDNA. Most tumor data is from a large homogenous batch of non-viable cells after 23 passages of the primary tumor cells, along with some data from different passages to enable an initial understanding of genomic instability. These data will be used by the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for somatic variant detection. In addition, extensive data from two different normal tissues from the same individual can enable understanding of mosaicism. Long reads also contain methylation tags for epigenetic analyses. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for whole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and normal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural somatic mutations. This first-of-its-kind broadly consented open-access resource will facilitate further understanding of sequencing methods used for cancer biology.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

We aimed to test whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using different epigenetic clocks predict long-term overall, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 2,105 participants to the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged [&ge;]50 years old who were followed for mortality through 2019. EAAs was calculated from the residuals of Horvath, Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Zhang, Lin, Weidner, Vidal-Bralo and Grim epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age. Using cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of EAA (per 5-year) and the DunedinPoAm pace of aging (per 10% increase) with overall, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, adjusting for covariates and white blood cell composition.

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim EAA (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32-1.71) followed by Hannum (P = 0.001; HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.27), Pheno (P = 0.001; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), Horvath (P = 0.007; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.22) and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.008; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) EAAs. Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.29-1.86), whereas Hannum (P = 0.006; HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.44), Horvath (P = 0.02; HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.35) and Grim (P = 0.049; HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00-1.87) EAAs predicted cancer mortality. DunedinPoAm pace of aging was associated with overall (P = 0.003; HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38) and cardiovascular (P = 0.04; HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.55) mortality.

ConclusionsIn a U.S. representative sample, Horvath, Hannum, Pheno, Vidal-Bralo and Grim EAA all predicted overall mortality but only Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality and Horvath, Hannum or Grim EAA predicted cancer mortality. Pace of aging predicted overall and cardiovascular mortality.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754700

Combination of variant effect data from several such experiments provides the opportunity to conduct large-scale analyses of variant effect scores measured across proteins, but can be complicated by variations in the phenotypes that are probed across experiments. Thus, using variant effect datasets obtained with similar MAVE techniques can help reveal general rules governing the effects of amino acid variation for a single molecular phenotype. In this work, we accordingly combined data from six individual variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) experiments and analysed a total of 31,614 variant effect scores reporting solely on the impact of single amino acid residue substitutions on the cellular abundance of proteins. Using our combined variant effect dataset, we derived and analysed a collection of amino acid substitution matrices describing the average impact on cellular abundance of all residue substitution types in different structural environments. We found that the substitution matrices predict the cellular abundance of protein variants with surprisingly high accuracy when given structural information only in the form of whether a residue is buried or exposed. We thus propose our substitution matrix-based predictions as strong baselines for future abundance model development.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

Previous studies have reported that overexpression of ASCL1 or combinations of proneural factors in Muller glia (MG) induces regeneration of functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. Recently, we applied the same strategy in dissociated cultures of fetal human MG and although we stimulated neurogenesis from MG, our effect in 2D cultures was modest and our analysis of newborn neurons was limited. In this study, we aimed to improve our MG reprogramming strategy in a more intact retinal environment. For this purpose, we used an in vitro culture system of human fetal retinal tissue and adult human postmortem retina. To stimulate reprogramming, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver constructs with a glial-specific promoter (HES1) driving ASCL1 alone or in combination with additional developmental transcription factors such as ATOH1 and NEUROD1. Combining IHC, scRNA-seq and electrophysiology, we show for the first time that human MG can generate new neurons even in adults. This work constitutes a key step towards a future clinical application of this regenerative medicine approach for retinal degenerative disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1727647754700

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727647754700

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.
