MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt). Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges' g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges' g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms. Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta 2 and M 2 against G protein coupled alpha 1, beta 1, beta 2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3 mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014). These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta 2 and M 2), specific epitopes of the COVID virus's SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000) Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.

Early cases were associated with this market, and environmental sequencing placed the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity within the market. Phylogenetic analysis also suggested separate introductions of lineages A and B into the human population, a finding that can be tested with additional data. Here, we curated an expanded sequence dataset of early SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes, including newly available sequences from mid-January 2020. In this dataset, we found no additional support for previously proposed alternative progenitor sequences, or for any evolutionary intermediates between lineages A and B in the human population. Instead, we identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages that may have spread from the market, and additional samples of a sublineage of lineage A with three mutations, including one found in closely related bat coronaviruses. Although our analysis of early pandemic genomes suggests that this mutation is unlikely to characterize the immediate SARS-CoV-2 ancestor, it is more plausible than two previously proposed ancestral genomes. These findings reinforce the proposed emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from the wildlife trade at the Huanan market, demonstrating how new data continues to both solidify and clarify our understanding of how the pandemic began.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

A protein destined for degradation is first tagged with a polyubiquitin chain, which is selected by the proteasome. Different ubiquitin chain topologies serve as distinct signals, with K48-linked chains acting as the canonical degradation signal and K11/K48-branched chains providing even more potent targeting, particularly during cell cycle regulation. However, the structural basis for how the proteasome distinguishes between these different chain architectures has remained unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the human 26S proteasome bound to both a K48-linked tetraubiquitin chain and a K11/K48-branched chain. Our structures reveal distinct binding modes for these two types of chain linkage. K48 chains wrap around the Ubiquitin interaction motif of the receptor RPN10 in an unexpected spiral conformation, while K11 branches engage the proteasome through previously uncharacterised interfaces in a cleft formed between RPN2 and RPN10. Through structure-guided mutagenesis and cellular studies, we demonstrate that these binding modes are essential for efficient substrate degradation and cell cycle progression. These findings establish how the proteasome achieves selective substrate recognition through chain topology-specific interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

The effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents in real-world settings is not well understood.

OBJECTIVETo evaluate the effectiveness of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years given within the first five days of acute COVID-19 illness on illness severity during the acute (days 0 to 27) and post-acute phases (days 28 to 179).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis target trial emulation used the electronic health records (EHR) data from twenty-nine medical institutions participating in the NIHs RECOVER consortium. We included data collected between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023, and included all patients with a SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the day of entry. Those who were treated with oral nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test (n=2,923) and those who did not received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days after the positive test during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (control group, n=31,947) were identified.

EXPOSURESTreatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir based on prescription records.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESWe used modified Poisson regression models for binary outcomes to examine the effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir on acute phase hospitalization, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits as well as progression to moderate or severe acute illness among individuals treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir compared to control counterparts. Additionally, we assessed the medications associations with 16 conditions and symptoms during the acute phase of illness and its subsequent association with specific Long COVID diagnostic code U09.9 during the post-acute phase. We reported the absolute risks and estimated the relative risks (RRs), with adjustments made for demographic variables, clinical characteristics, and healthcare utilization, using propensity score matching.

RESULTSThe study cohort included 34,870 adolescents (median [Q1, Q3] age 16.0 [14.0, 18.0]); 46.0% male and 43.2% Non-Hispanic White. Among these patients, 2,923 were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir within 5 days of cohort entry and 31,947 received no treatment. The absolute rates were 0.58% vs. 0.96% for hospitalization, 74.17% vs. 82.66% for outpatient visits, 1.81% vs. 2.28% for ED visits, 3.08% vs. 3.99% for moderate/severe acute illness, and 0.21% vs. 0.20% for long COVID diagnosis in the treatment vs. control group. After propensity score matching, during acute-phase period, compared to the control group, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of any hospitalization (relative risk (RR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29-0.80), outpatient visit (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.82-0.90), and moderate/severe acute illness (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56-0.87). Additionally, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir was associated with reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions in chest pain (RR 0.41; 95% CI 0.26-0.63), fatigue and malaise (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.32-0.76), generalized pain (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.45-0.95), headache (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.83), mental health (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.39-0.80), musculoskeletal (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.94), and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.71). No evidence was found to suggest that the treatment was associated with the risk of long COVID diagnosis U09.9 (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.40-2.32).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEThis study found that treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir in adolescents within 5 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was associated with reduced risk of acute-phase COVID-19 illness and subsequent healthcare utilization. However, treatment was not associated with a lower risk of Long COVID diagnosis.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir reduce the acute COVID-19 illness severity and the risk of developing Long COVID in adolescents aged 12 to 20 years?

FindingsIn this target trial emulation study of 34,870 adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not hospitalized on the cohort entry day, 2,923 who were treated with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir exhibited lower acute illness severity including reduced risk of 7 of 16 specified conditions and symptoms, as well as reduced risk of acute-phase hospitalization and outpatient visits, compared with 31,947 who received no treatment. The association with reduced risk of Long COVID was not observed in this study.

However, the reproducibility and reliability of these findings could remain uncertain for years. Here, we implemented a multi-institutional collaborative approach to define the robust and replicable effects of the psychedelic drug psilocybin on mouse behavior. Five laboratories performed the same experiments to test the acute and persistent effects of psilocybin (2 mg/kg, IP) on various behaviors that psychedelics have been proposed to affect, including anxiety-related approach-avoidance, exploration, sociability, depression-related behaviors, fear extinction, and social reward learning. Through this coordinated approach, we found that psilocybin had several robust and replicable acute effects on mouse behavior, including increased anxiety- and avoidance-related behaviors and decreased fear expression. Surprisingly, however, we found that psilocybin did not have replicable effects 24 hours post psilocybin administration on reducing anxiety- and depression-like behaviors or facilitating fear extinction learning. Additionally, we were unable to observe psilocybin-induced alterations in social preference or social reward learning. Overall, our comprehensive characterization of psilocybin's acute and persistent behavioral effects using ~200 total male and female mice per experiment spread across five independent labs demonstrates with unique certainty several acute drug effects and suggests that psilocybin's persistent effects in mice may be more modest and inconsistent than previously suggested. We believe this unusual multi49 laboratory, highly coordinated research effort serves as a model for facilitating the generation of replicable results and consequently will reduce efforts based on unreliable and spurious results.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 childrens hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023.

EXPOSURESA second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10- CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching.

RESULTSA total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEChildren and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo children and adolescents face an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) following reinfection during the Omicron era?

FindingsDuring the post-acute phase, children and adolescents with reinfection are at statistically significant increased risk of incident PASC outcomes, including an overall PASC diagnosis and 24 most commonly complaints/symptoms/diagnoses associated with PASC. The risks remained consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups.

MeaningThese findings underscore the significant long-term health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and adolescents. Public health strategies should prioritize reinfection prevention, including enhanced vaccination efforts, to mitigate the burden of PASC in the pediatric population.","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484

We analyzed over 130,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, over 85,000 with matched epidemiological data, collected in Massachusetts from November 2021 to January 2023, to investigate viral transmission dynamics at high resolution. The data were drawn from diagnostic testing at >600 facilities representing schools, workplaces, public testing, and other sectors, and encompass the emergence of six major viral lineages, each representing a new outbreak. We found urban areas as key hubs for new lineage introduction and interurban transmission as facilitating spread throughout the state. Young adults, especially those on college campuses, served as early indicators of emerging lineage dominance. Resident-aged populations in college campuses and nursing homes exhibited a higher likelihood of being linked to within-facility transmission, while staff-aged at those facilities were more linked to their surrounding community. Individuals with recent vaccine doses, including boosters, had a lower likelihood of initiating transmission. This dataset shows the value of linking genomic and epidemiologic data at scale for higher resolution insights into viral dynamics and their implication for public health strategy.","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484

However, how adaptive TEs arise in populations and historical contingencies affect TE dynamics remains unknown. Fungal pathogens in agriculture provide unique frameworks to address such questions due to the availability of spatially explicit sampling and well-characterized niche conditions. We characterised TE evolutionary dynamics using an extensive intraspecies sampling of 1,953 genomes across the global distribution range of the major fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Employing a pangenomic approach, we characterise genomic diversity and benchmark methods to robustly infer TE insertion polymorphism, before systematically assessing TEs as a source of adaptive variation. We annotated ~3.2 million TE loci among genomes, finding substantial variation in TE content within and among populations. TE activity surged during the pathogen's expansion from its centre of origin in the Middle East, with unique TE activity profiles arising in derived populations. TE-mediated adaptation emerged from distinct waves of TE mobilization. The highest rates of TE activity were observed over timescales as short as 25 years. 45 TE loci showing local adaptation signatures within 1kb of 49 host genes were identified, with adaptive TE insertions likely related to adaptation to antifungals and the plant host environment. This work highlights the power of vast genomic datasets to unravel intraspecies TE invasion histories and pinpoint factors likely driving recent adaptation. This argues for a shift in focus to incorporate deep population-level TE activity surveys in our pursuit to uncover the molecular drivers of adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Despite nearly a century of research, the computations underlying this projection have not been adequately addressed. In the present study, we employed model-driven psychophysics to fill this gap. We hypothesized that tool-based sensory projection involves the remapping of touch from sensory feedback in the hand into an egocentric coordinate system. We first formalized the computational steps underlying tactile remapping. We designed a novel tool-sensing experiment that allowed us to rigorously test this model. In this task, participants contacted an object with a hand-held rod and then judged whether the object was above or below where they were currently looking. This comparison would only be possible if touch on the tool was projected outside the hand. Crucially, both object location and gaze position varied independently, allowing us to characterize the hand-to-space-to-gaze remapping process. Model-based curve fitting provided strong evidence that all participants in our task projected touch outside their body and into gaze-centered coordinates. Crucially, the resolution of this projection was similar to what has been found for touch on the body. These findings provide the first step towards characterizing the computations underlying the spatial projection of touch on external objects, highlighting the incredible versatility of the sensorimotor system.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Generally, site-specific ablation of material is achieved by scanning a highly focused probe across a selected area, leading to the removal of material. However, the geometries of TEM lamellae milled with the FIB are usually highly non-isometric, with their thickness generally being orders of magnitude smaller than their width and length. Here, we explore a changed probe shape for milling. Instead of using a Gaussian-like spot probe ion beam, we characterize the use of the stigmator as quasi-cylindrical lens to create a highly astigmatic beam that we term  ion knife. Using the ion knife allows for material ablation by spreading the current over a larger area and changes the dimension of the probe with an anisotropic change in apparent beam resolution, as observed in spot burn cross-sections. We demonstrate a method to approximate beam shapes by imaging that allows for convenient alignment of parameters for beam shaping. Finally, exploring shaped probes in cryogenic lamella preparation, we demonstrate the feasibility of cellular lamella milling and sectioning of cryo-lift-out volumes with the ion knife.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

We present BromoCatch, a novel SLP platform based on a small ~13 kDa bromodomain (BD) engineered with a nucleophilic cysteine for covalent ligand engagement. Structure-based designed library of 16 'bumped' binders bearing diverse electrophilic warheads were screened against two different cysteine mutants using differential scanning fluorimetry and intact protein mass spectrometry to monitor covalent complex formation. The para-acrylamide bumped derivative MR116 and the Brd4-BD2 double mutant L387A,E438C formed the most potent and stable adduct, and its binding mode through covalent modification was confirmed by an X-ray cocrystal structure solved to 1.3 Angstrom of resolution. BromoCatch exhibited potent and irreversible target engagement in cells through nanoBRET and residence time assays. Practicality and scope are further demonstrated through the design and proof-of-concept application of a biotinylated conjugate, PROTAC tag degraders, and fluorescent probes of both full-on and switch-on types for ex-cellulo and live-cell imaging.

While abnormal crossover recombination is known to confer risk for aneuploidy, limited data have hindered understanding of the potential shared genetic basis of these key molecular phenotypes. To address this gap, we performed retrospective analysis of preimplantation genetic testing data from 139,416 in vitro fertilized embryos from 22,850 sets of biological parents. By tracing transmission of haplotypes, we identified 3,656,198 crossovers, as well as 92,485 aneuploid chromosomes. Counts of crossovers were lower in aneuploid versus euploid embryos, consistent with their role in chromosome pairing and segregation. Our analyses further revealed that a common haplotype spanning the meiotic cohesin SMC1B is significantly associated with both crossover count and maternal meiotic aneuploidy, with evidence supporting a non-coding cis-regulatory mechanism. Transcriptome- and phenome-wide association tests also implicated variation in the synaptonemal complex component C14orf39 and crossover-regulating ubiquitin ligases CCNB1IP1 and RNF212 in meiotic aneuploidy risk. More broadly, recombination and aneuploidy possess a partially shared genetic basis that also overlaps with reproductive aging traits. Our findings highlight the dual role of recombination in generating genetic diversity, while ensuring meiotic fidelity.","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484

This is because it is especially useful for incorporating fossil data into such analyses, integrating fossils along with their age information directly into the tree as tips or sampled ancestors. Two approaches are common for placing fossil taxa in trees: inference based on morphological character data or using taxonomic constraints to control their topological placement. These approaches have historically been treated as alternatives, though combining the two is theoretically possible. For phylogenetic inference of entirely extinct organisms, additional related fossil taxa other than those for which morphology is available are generally overlooked. Here, we implement a combined approach on an empirical dataset for a group of trilobites. We use a morphological matrix and ages for 56 taxa and age information for another 196 taxa from the Paleobiology Database. To evaluate the effects of a combined approach, we conducted FBD dated phylogenetic analyses using a combined approach with morphology and taxonomic constraints and compared them to analyses of taxa with morphology alone. We find that a combined approach yields topologies that are more stratigraphically congruent, substantially more precise parameter estimates (e.g., divergence times), and more informative tree distributions. These findings are a consequence of the substantial increase in stratigraphic age information and a more representative sample of their temporal distributions.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Among these, histone modifications like H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 play opposing roles in gene activation and repression, respectively. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27me3 is deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), while Trithorax group (TrxG) proteins mediate H3K4me3 deposition. While the functions of these writer complexes have been extensively studied, far less is known about the histone mark readers that interpret these modifications during development. Here, we investigate the antagonistic interplay between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 during Arabidopsis embryogenesis. We identify a developmentally specific interaction between the FIS-PRC2 complex and ALFIN-LIKE (AL) proteins - a family of plant-specific PHD domain proteins that read H3K4me3. Our findings reveal a dynamic competition between these two marks during early embryogenesis that helps shape the epigenomic landscape of the developing seed. Disruption of AL function leads to severe developmental defects and loss of cell identity in early embryos. Moreover, loss of ALs impairs H3K4me3 deposition, resulting in aberrant spreading of H3K27me3, misregulation of developmental genes, and defects that persist into adult plant traits. Together, our results show that proper embryonic development relies on a finely tuned antagonism between activating and repressive chromatin states-an interplay orchestrated not only by their writers but also by specific readers that translate these epigenetic cues into developmental outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

A recent paper investigated motivational trade-offs in bumblebees and concluded that bees can trade-off heat against high sugar rewards.

This siloed approach prevents generalization across biomolecular classes and limits the ability to model interaction interfaces systematically. We introduce ATOMICA, a geometric deep learning model that learns atomic-scale representations of intermolecular interfaces across diverse biomolecular modalities, including small molecules, metal ions, amino acids, and nucleic acids. ATOMICA uses a self-supervised denoising and masking objective to train on 2,037,972 interaction complexes and generate hierarchical embeddings at the levels of atoms, chemical blocks, and molecular interfaces. The model generalizes across molecular classes and recovers shared physicochemical features without supervision. Its latent space captures compositional and chemical similarities across interaction types and follows scaling laws that improve representation quality with increasing biomolecular data modalities. We apply ATOMICA to construct five modality-specific interfaceome networks, termed ATOMICANets, which connect proteins based on interaction similarity with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. These networks identify disease pathways across 27 conditions and predict disease-associated proteins in autoimmune neuropathies and lymphoma. Finally, we use ATOMICA to annotate the dark proteome--proteins lacking known structure or function--by predicting 2,646 previously uncharacterized ligand-binding sites.

Thus, entire continents rely on results from research conducted in wealthier countries whose main findings are unlikely to generalize across other world regions. Moreover, statistical models perform poorly when applied to minorities, a blind spot with serious consequences in biomedicine, and which can only be addressed by analysing microbiome data from currently neglected areas.

This task is especially difficult for complex genomic readouts such as MNase-seq, which maps nucleosome occupancy but is confounded by experimental bias. To overcome these limitations, we introduce pairwise influence by sequence attribution (PISA), an interpretation tool that combinatorially decodes which bases are responsible for the readout at a specific genomic coordinate. PISA visualizes the effects of transcription factor motifs, uncovers previously hidden motifs with complex contribution patterns, and reveals experimental biases of genomics assays. Integrated into a deep learning suite called BPReveal, PISA enables accurate MNase-seq nucleosome prediction models with reduced experimental bias, allowing the de novo discovery of motifs that mediate nucleosome positioning and the design of sequences with altered nucleosome configurations. These results show that PISA is a versatile tool that expands our ability to extract novel cis-regulatory sequence rules from genomics data, paving the way towards deciphering the cis-regulatory code.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Circadian timing in plants is governed by an oscillator gene network of transcriptional regulators that exists in each cell. Wheat provides an opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of the plant circadian oscillator in an important agricultural species. We recently found that a single oscillator component EARLY FLOWERING 3 is expressed at a different time in wheat compared to the model plant Arabidopsis. This was unexpected since there is remarkable conservation of timing of activity of the different oscillator components within a kingdom, for example, even when animals switch from nocturnal to diurnal activity. We have examined how the change in timing of ELF3 transcription between Arabidopsis and wheat has occurred and its implications for circadian oscillator function. We describe an optimised computational model of the wheat circadian oscillator that is informed by experimental data and the structure of the promoter elements driving oscillator gene expression. Our optimised computational models suggest that the dawn-expression of the key oscillator gene ELF3 in wheat occurs due to repression of the ELF3 promoter by TOC1.

Earlier studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and other plant species have revealed the eminent role of alternative precursor mRNA splicing (AS), which allows fine-tuning the expression of numerous genes including light signaling and photosynthesis-related components in response to the ambient light conditions. Starting from the previous finding that AS changes induced by either light or metabolic signals are linked to phospho-signaling, we applied phospho-proteomics to identify proteins that undergo rapid changes in their phosphorylation status upon exposing etiolated seedlings to either light or sucrose. This approach revealed hyperphosphorylation of RS41, a member of the RS subfamily of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. To study the function of the four RS genes RS31, RS31a, RS40, and RS41, a comprehensive set of single and higher order mutants was generated. A complete loss of RS function in the quadruple mutant caused sterility. Moreover, the important role of the RS proteins in seedling photomorphogenesis was demonstrated, with both redundant and specific functions in the regulation of hypocotyl elongation and cotyledon opening. We further identified the critical contribution of the RS proteins to light-dependent alternative splicing, being part of an intricate network of splicing regulatory components. Our study provides novel insight into the complex network of RNA-binding proteins that allow balancing light-responsive splicing and development in Arabidopsis seedlings.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

The pathogenicity was confirmed through reinoculation using fresh urediniospores. This represents the first record of U. plumbarius outside its native range in North America. Its widespread distribution in France appears to result from rapid dissemination, likely facilitated by the plant trade between nursery gardeners.

Hubs are often thought to have emergent nucleus-wide properties depending on transcription factor nuclear concentrations and intrinsic, protein sequence-dependent properties. This global model does not account for gene-specific hub regulation. Using high-resolution lattice light-sheet microscopy in Drosophila embryos, we examined hubs formed by the morphogen transcription factor, Dorsal, at reporter genes with distinct enhancer compositions. We found that snail recruits long-lived, high-intensity hubs; sog exhibits shorter-lived, lower-intensity hubs; and hunchback, lacking Dorsal binding sites, shows only transient hub interactions. Hub intensity and interaction duration correlate with burst amplitude, RNAPII loading rate, and transcriptional output. These findings challenge the global view of hub formation and support a model where hub properties are locally tuned in a gene-specific manner to regulate transcriptional kinetics.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

The jump model has been completely solved analytically and provides the exact distribution of syntenic gene block lengths (SBL) in compared genomes based on gene translocations alone. Comparing the SBL distribution predicted by the jump model with the distributions empirically observed for multiple groups of closely related bacterial and archaeal genomes, we obtained robust estimates of the genome rearrangement to gene flux (gain and loss) ratio. In most groups of bacteria and archaea, this ratio was found to be on the order of 0.1 indicating that the loss of synteny in the evolution of bacteria and archaea is driven primarily by gene gain and loss rather than by gene translocation.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Researchers have begun to explore whether Paxlovid treatment in the acute phase of COVID-19 could help prevent the onset of PASC. Methods and Findings We used electronic health records from the National Clinical Cohort Collaborative (N3C) to define a cohort of 410,026 patients who had COVID-19 since April 1, 2022, and were eligible for Paxlovid treatment due to risk for progression to severe COVID-19. We used the target trial emulation framework to estimate the effect of Paxlovid treatment on PASC incidence. The treatment group was defined as outpatients prescribed Paxlovid within five days of COVID-19 index, and the control group was defined as all patients meeting eligibility criteria not in the treatment group. The follow-up period was 180 days. We estimated overall PASC incidence using a computable phenotype. We also measured incident cognitive, fatigue, and respiratory symptoms in the post-acute period. Paxlovid treatment had a small effect on overall PASC incidence (relative risk [RR] 0.94; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]; p=0.011). It had a slightly stronger protective effect against cognitive (RR 0.86; 95% CI [0.77, 0.95]; p<0.001) and fatigue (RR 0.92; 95% CI [0.86, 0.97]; p=0.002) symptoms. Conclusions In this study, Paxlovid had a weaker preventative effect on PASC than in prior observational studies, suggesting that Paxlovid is unlikely to become a definitive solution for preventing PASC. Differing effects by symptom cluster suggest that the etiology of cognitive and fatigue symptoms may be more closely related to viral load than that of respiratory symptoms. Future research should explore potential heterogeneous treatment effects across PASC subphenotypes. 1","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484

By sub-second live imaging of injured zebrafish larval fins, we identify events across timescales: a millisecond tissue depolarization gradient, followed by seconds-persistent intracellular Calcium responses. Subsequently within one hour, Voltage Sensing Phosphatase activity translates depolarisation into proliferation. Connecting these timescales with an electro-diffusive model showed that ionic fluxes and electric potential become coupled in the fin's interstitial space, enabling organ-wide signal spreading.

Chromatin regulating complexes are frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in HCC, suggesting dysregulation of chromatin environments is a key feature driving liver cancer. To investigate whether the altered chromatin state in HCC cells could be targeted, we designed and utilized an epigenome-focused CRISPR library that targets genes involved in chromatin regulation. This focused approach allowed us to test multiple HCC cell lines in both 2D and 3D growth conditions, which revealed striking differences in the essentiality of genes involved in ubiquitination and multiple chromatin regulators vital for HCC cell survival in 2D but whose loss promoted growth in 3D. We found the core subunits of the menin-MLL1 complex among the strongest essential genes for HCC survival in all screens and thoroughly characterized the mechanism through which the menin-MLL1 complex promotes HCC cell growth. Inhibition of the menin-MLL1 interaction led to global changes in occupancy of the complex with concomitant decreases in H3K4me3 and expression of genes involved in PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Menin inhibition affected chromatin accessibility in HCC cells, revealing that increased chromatin accessibility at sites not bound by menin-MLL1 was associated with the recruitment of the pioneer transcription factor complex NF-Y. A CRISPR/Cas9 screen of chromatin regulators in the presence of menin inhibitor SNDX-5613 revealed a significantly increased cell death when combined with NFYB knockout. Together these data show that menin-MLL1 is necessary for HCC cell survival and cooperates with NF-Y to regulate oncogenic gene transcription.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Here, we show in mice that feeding of antigen-containing diet generates in mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal lamina propria peripherally derived regulatory T (pTreg) cells that exhibit a terminally differentiated effector phenotype as seen with tissue-resident thymus-derived Treg (tTreg) cells. Antigen feeding also enables the generated pTreg cells to acquire Treg-specific epigenomic changes in Treg signature genes including Foxp3, hence the stability of Treg-specific function. Cessation of antigen feeding, however, results in decline in oral tolerance with diminution of pTreg cells. Transcriptomic comparison with tTreg cells has revealed that pTreg cells induced by antigen feeding predominantly express CD101. CD101+ Treg cells with a similar phenotype and epigenetic alterations can be generated in vitro from antigen-primed naive CD4+ T cells by blockade of CD28-mediated co-stimulation during TGF-{beta}-dependent Treg induction. Furthermore, in vivo CD28 signal blockade by CTLA-4-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4-Ig) before antigen feeding can establish oral tolerance in the mice precedingly antigen-sensitized by a non-oral route. The CTLA4-Ig treatment not only suppresses activation of antigen-reactive conventional T cells but also facilitates their differentiation into antigen-specific CD101+ pTreg cells. Thus, continuous oral antigen administration combined with CD28 co-stimulation blockade generates a specific type of antigen-specific functionally stable pTreg cells, which can establish long-term systemic antigen-specific immune tolerance even in antigen-pre-sensitized animals. This strategy for mucosal tolerance induction would be instrumental in treating chronic allergy and other immunological diseases in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

While vaccination played a key role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, variants of concern (VOC) with immune evasive substitutions emerged on multiple occasions, causing widespread breakthrough infections. The combined threats of zoonosis and newly emerging VOCs, coupled with the potential for recombination, underscore the need to assess the breadth of existing vaccine-mediated protection. Here, we investigate a cohort of older individuals (median age 68.5 years) for the potential of cross-neutralisation against Omicron lineage VOC and animal sarbecoviruses induced by four COVID-19 vaccine doses. Despite the recent use of a bivalent mRNA vaccine dose (encoding spike from Wu-1 and omicron), we observed that neutralisation of Omicron lineage VOCs such as BA.1 and BA.2 were reduced compared to SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1, suggesting an imprinted immune response from pre-Omicron lineage viruses. Similarly, both SARS-CoV-1 and a SARS-CoV-1-related bat CoV were neutralised less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that two animal SARS-CoV-2-related viruses, BANAL-20-52 (from bats) and a pangolin-CoV, were more sensitive to serum neutralising antibodies than SARS-CoV-2 Wu-1 itself.

Species distribution models (SDMs) are used for understanding where species live or could potentially live and are a key resource for ecological research and conservation decision-making. However, current SDM methods often perform poorly for rare or inadequately sampled species, which includes most species on earth as well as most of those of the greatest conservation concern. 2. Here, we evaluate the performance of three recently developed modeling approaches specifically designed for data-deficient situations: 1) plug-and-play modeling, 2) density-ratio modeling, and 3) environmental-range modeling. We compare the performance of these methods with Maxent, a widely used method. We compare model performance across sample sizes as well as comparisons limited to only data-poor species. We also ask to what extent model cross-validation performance on training data was correlated with model performance on independent, presence-absence data. 3. We show that, across all species, one or more of the plug-and-play, density-ratio, or environmental-range algorithms outperformed Maxent in 72% of cases, with three of the algorithms having AUC distributions not significantly different from Maxent's. For data-poor species (those with 20 or fewer occurrences), 24 of the algorithms considered had AUC distributions that were not significantly different from Maxent. However, despite these comparable AUC scores, we found that the algorithm outputs (when thresholded to predict presence vs absence) spanned a wide gradient of sensitivity vs. specificity. Specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on training data were strongly correlated with specificity and prediction accuracy assessed on independent presence-absence data, however AUC and sensitivity had weak correlations. We found that only for 16% of species was the model that performed best on the training data the best performing model when evaluated on independent, presence-absence data. Finally, we show how ensembles of models that span the sensitivity-specificity gradient can represent model disagreement in poorly sampled species and improve model predictions. 4.This work supports plug-and-play, density-ratio, and environmental-range modeling as useful alternatives to Maxent, particularly for data-deficient species. While our work suggests that identifying the best model for a given species is challenging, we argue that incorporating the predictions of multiple models provides a useful way forward.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Despite being the first recombinant therapeutic approved by the FDA, insulin remains challenging to access for many around the globe. Here we report on advancements in manufacturing insulin using cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) systems to rapidly produce mature desB30-insulin in less than a day. This is a major advance towards decentralizing insulin manufacturing and bringing production closer to the point-of-care, thereby improving diabetic patient accessibility. To this end, a purified cell-free extract, PUREfrex(R) 2.1, was utilized to synthesize a tagged proinsulin construct that can be captured and converted into mature insulin using an on-column affinity chromatography process. Notably, two chaperones, peptidyl prolyl isomerase (FkpA), and seven kilodalton protein (Skp) were observed to play a critical role during cell-free expression of proinsulin. The proinsulin was then immobilized on a Ni-NTA column where the purification and conversion of cell-free products were performed sequentially to yield desB30-insulin. Following further optimization, this method serves as a time and resource-efficient production process as compared to current methods. When applied simultaneously, the cell-free expression and on-column conversion methods reported here can be adopted to enable rapid on-demand insulin manufacturing in order to improve the accessibility of insulin and prevent future shortages.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Reinforcement learning (RL) has provided a computational framework to study this process, and neural signals linked to RL have been identified in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. More recently, hippocampal contributions to this kind of value-learning have been proposed, at least under some conditions. Here, we test whether the hippocampus provides a signal of the option's identity that aids in credit assignment when learning about several perceptually similar items, and evaluate how this process differs across the lifespan. A sample of 251 younger and older adults, including a subset (n = 76) with simultaneous fMRI, completed an RL task in which they learned the value of four houses through trial-and-error. Older adults showed decreased choice accuracy, accompanied by reduced neural signaling of value at choice but not feedback. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that the precision with which choice options were represented in the posterior hippocampus during choice predicted accurate decisions across age groups. Interestingly, despite previous evidence for neural de-differentiation in older adults, we found no support for a ""blurring"" of these stimulus representations in older adults. Rather, we observed reduced connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and the medial PFC in older adults, and this connectivity correlated with choice consistency. Taken together, these findings identify a hippocampal contribution to incremental value learning, and that reductions in incremental value learning in older adults are associated with the reduced transfer of information between the hippocampus and mPFC, rather than the precision of the information in the hippocampus itself.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Beyond their metabolic roles, amino acids have been increasingly recognized as regulators of plant immunity. However, the molecular mechanisms by which amino acids modulate defense responses remain unclear. In this study, we identify a novel function for serine as a defense-priming signal. Serine pretreatment enhances immune gene expression and primes plants for a more rapid and robust response to pathogen infection, resulting in a significant delay in programmed cell death (PCD) during effector-triggered immunity (ETI). We further demonstrate that serine-induced defense activation is mediated by glutamate receptor-like calcium channel 3.4 (GLR3.4), which subsequently activates calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (CPK5). CPK5 in turn phosphorylates WRKY transcription factors, including WRKY33, to induce key immune genes. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized serine-initiated signaling pathway that primes plant defense, highlighting both its mechanistic novelty and its potential application in sustainable agriculture. Given that serine is a naturally occurring metabolite, its exogenous application--or the use of structurally similar analogs--may offer a cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and non-genetic strategy to enhance disease resistance in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone. The adjusted hazard ratio for hair loss for all patients using semaglutide, for men, and for women compared to bupropion-naltrexone were 1.52 (95% confidence interval (CI):0.86-2.69), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.05-14.49), and 2.08 (95% CI: 1.17-3.72) respectively. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of hair loss with semaglutide in women.

Early studies of mtDNA variation provided the first genetic evidence for the African origin of modern humans. With complete mitochondrial genome sequencing, we can now reconstruct maternal lineages with high resolution, yet large parts of the continent remain underrepresented. Using a newly developed long-range sequencing assay, we generated 1,288 complete mitochondrial genomes from 14 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on previously understudied regions. We combined these with over 3,600 publicly available African mitogenomes to produce a comprehensive dataset and updated overview of maternal genetic diversity across the continent. We contextualized this diversity with autosomal structure and information on major human expansions, integrating archaeological and linguistic evidence. Our analyses reveal a demographic expansion of Niger-Congo speakers around 17 thousand years ago (kya), followed by a second expansion associated with Bantu-speaking groups around 6 kya. We identify haplogroup L3e as a key marker of this early Bantu expansion, tracking its spread across sub-Saharan Africa. Distinct demographic signatures also emerge for different geographic sub-branches of Bantu speakers. These findings highlight the power of mitochondrial DNA to trace maternal ancestry and demographic history in Africa, while also acknowledging its limitations for phylogeographic reconstruction.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

By utilizing only the Pairformer and Confidence modules, our method significantly reduces computational costs while achieving outstanding in silico success rates and diversity in binder generation. Optimizing directly on the distogram allows us to shape the probability distribution of atomic distances, rather than adjusting a single structure, steering the design toward sequences that yield robust structures with well-defined energy minima. By leveraging a fully atomic model trained on a wide variety of macromolecules, we can generate diverse heterocomplexes with flexible ligand conformations--a capability not currently matched by existing methods. This approach enables the design of novel protein interactions with potential applications in biosensors, enzyme engineering, therapeutic development, and biotechnological innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Transposable elements (TEs) are increasingly recognized as contributors to genome evolution, but their role in shaping neural crest regulatory programs remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the domestication of human-specific TEs as transcriptional enhancers during cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) specification, a process critical for vertebrate head development. Using human iPSC-derived CNCCs, we identified [~]250 human-specific TEs acting as active enhancers. These TEs were predominantly LTR5Hs and, to a lesser extent, SVA-E/Fs. We demonstrate that these elements have been co-opted through the acquisition of the conserved CNCC coordinator motif, and are bound by the CNCC signature factor TWIST1, and that their co-option appears to be largely exclusive to CNCCs. To assess their functional relevance, we used CRISPR-interference to repress [~]75% of all the LTR5Hs and SVAs active in CNCCs, which led to widespread transcriptional changes in genes associated with neural crest migration, a process essential for CNCCs to populate the embryo and form craniofacial structures. Using a cell migration assay, we showed that CNCC migration was significantly impaired by CRISPR-mediated TE repression. Finally, we demonstrate that genes near human-specific TEs are more highly expressed in human CNCCs relative to chimpanzee, and TE repression returns their expression to chimpanzee levels. These findings reveal how human-specific TEs have been co-opted to fine-tune CNCC regulatory networks, potentially contributing to the evolution of lineage-specific craniofacial traits.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Most land plants form arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, an ancient trait for enhanced nutrition that was convergently lost in some clades. Carnivory, another nutritional trait, is a more recent adaptation that has convergently arisen in several angiosperm orders. The two biotic interactions similarly help plants acquire mineral nutrients, raising the question of whether they can coexist. However, the mycorrhizal status of carnivorous plants has long remained speculative. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of AM-associated genes in five angiosperm orders harbouring carnivorous species, revealing convergent losses of the AM trait either coincident with or predating the emergence of carnivory. Exceptionally, the carnivorous plant species Roridula gorgonias retains symbiosis-related genes and forms arbuscules upon inoculation assays, demonstrating the two nutritional strategies, although rare, can coexist. The youngest carnivorous lineage, Brocchinia reducta, showed signatures of the early stages of AM trait loss, as reflected by its gene retention and AM colonization patterns. An AM-associated CHITINASE gene encodes a digestive enzyme in the Australian pitcher plant Cephalotus, suggesting gene co-option. These findings illuminate the largely unexplored processes by which plant nutritional strategies evolve and supplant one another over time.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

In nature, protein folds are well-conserved over the course of evolution, such that there are 100,000 times as many extant protein sequences than there are folds. Despite their common shapes, similar protein folds can adopt wide-ranging functions, raising the question: are protein folds so strongly conserved for the purpose of maintaining function-driving energetic changes in protein families? Here we show that a set of key energetic relationships in a family of bacterial transcription factors (TFs) is conserved using high-resolution hydrogen exchange/mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. We compared the TFs to their anciently diverged structural homologs, the periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs), expecting that protein families that share the same fold and bind the same sugars would have similar energetic responses. Surprisingly, our findings reveal the opposite: the ""energetic blueprints"" of the PBPs and the TFs are largely distinct, with the allosteric network of the TFs evolving specifically to support the functional requirements of genome regulation, versus conserved interactions with membrane transport machinery in PBPs. These results demonstrate how the same fold can be adapted for different sense/response functions via family-specific energetic requirements - even when responding to the same chemical trigger. Understanding the evolutionarily conserved energetic blueprint for a protein family provides a roadmap for designing functional proteins de novo, and will help us treat aberrant protein behavior in conserved domains in disease-related drug targets, where engineering selectivity is challenging.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

However, the mechanism of ribosome recruitment to mRNA start sites strikingly differs between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The eukaryotic small (40S) ribosomal subunit binds 5 end caps and scans for the start codon while the bacterial small (30S) subunit directly binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motif close to the initiation site. Pioneer studies have shown rare 30S loading events further upstream within 5 untranslated regions (5UTRs), at ribosome standby sites1-3. Together with the frequent occurrence of long bacterial mRNA 5UTRs and degenerated SD sequences, this indicates that the 30S subunit might bind upstream of the SD more commonly than currently thought. We therefore developed 30S-seq to map 30S-mRNA interactions in a bacterial transcriptome (Escherichia coli), inspired by translation complex profile sequencing (TCP-seq) previously used in eukaryotes4,5. Our results provide new and unsuspected insights into the behaviour of 30S and 70S complexes during the canonical translation initiation process. Notably, 30S subunits are recruited upstream of the start codon, primed to receive the SD released by the departing 70S ribosome. Remarkably, we also find hundreds of non-canonical 30S binding sites within mRNA 5UTRs, sometimes over 100 nucleotides upstream of the start region. We validated several of these upstream ribosome binding sites, and demonstrated their strong impact on gene expression. Thus, even in bacteria, ribosomes frequently bind mRNAs outside of the start region to initiate translation, challenging the classic ribosome binding site model.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

There has been increasing evidence for post-transcriptional control of SPI gene expression by Hfq-dependent small RNAs (sRNAs) such as PinT. This 80-nucleotide sRNA is highly expressed after Salmonella enters host cells and modulates the transition from the SPI-1 to SPI-2 program by targeting different virulence factor mRNAs. It has been elusive, however, how PinT activity could be counteracted when virulence gene suppression were to be relieved. To identify putative inhibitors of PinT, we have mapped the RNA interactome of Salmonella recovered from infected macrophages, using an optimized version of the RIL-seq method. Next to offering an unprecedented view of Hfq-mediated RNA interactions during Salmonellas intracellular infection stage, RIL-seq uncovered the 3 end-derived sRNA InvS as a direct negative regulator of PinT. Biochemical and genetic experiments suggest a decoy mechanism whereby InvS lifts the PinT-mediated repression of virulence factors. Additionally, InvS acts as an mRNA repressor of the host cell adhesion protein, MipA, and PinT interaction with InvS relieves mipA repression.

Optimal transport adjusts data sparsity to match scRNA-seq references, enabling single-cell foundation models such as scGPT to generate unified features. Batch alignment then refines scGPT-transformed embeddings, mitigating batch effects while preserving biological variability. Evaluations on mouse brain samples from five different technologies demonstrate that LLOKI outperforms existing methods and is effective for cross-technology spatial gene program identification and tissue slice alignment. Applying LLOKI to five ovarian cancer datasets, we identify an integrated gene program indicative of tumor-infiltrating T cells across gene panels. Together, LLOKI provides a robust foundation for cross-platform ST studies, with the potential to scale to large atlas datasets, enabling deeper insights into cellular organization and tissue environments.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

These plants capture and digest prey for nutrients and this rare trait has evolved independently at least eleven times in thirteen families within six orders. Among these are the butterworts in the genus Pinguicula. This group of plants captures prey on a basal rosette of sticky leaves where the prey is broken down and digested. Here we present the chromosome-level reference assembly of the carnivorous giant butterwort, Pinguicula gigantea. An additional two assemblies were generated for this study, primarily from long-read sequencing data. In this study, we focus on the genome evolution of Pinguicula, including confirming at least two whole genome duplications since the gamma hexaploidy event at the base of the core eudicots. We provide evidence from full-genome data that the carnivorous family that Pinguicula belongs to, the Lentibulariaceae, is most closely related to the Acanthaceae. We also report multiple tandem duplications of candidate digestive enzyme genes, including a putative tandem duplication of cysteine proteases that is syntenic with two cysteine protease tandem duplication in Utricularia gibba that contain genes with trap specific expression. We also show evidence that these tandem duplications evolved independently in both Pinguicula and Utricularia gibbaUtricularia gibba and were potentially facilitated by different repeat element families.","NA","biorxiv",1744236531484

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1744236531484
