Recent deep learning all-atom methods have been built to address this challenge, but evaluating their performance on the prediction of protein-ligand complexes has been inconclusive due to the lack of relevant benchmarking datasets. Here we present a comprehensive evaluation of four leading all-atom cofolding deep learning methods using our newly introduced benchmark dataset Runs N' Poses, which comprises 2,600 high-resolution protein-ligand systems released after the training cutoff used by these methods. We demonstrate that current co-folding approaches largely memorise ligand poses from their training data, hindering their use for de novo drug design. This limitation is especially pronounced for ligands that have only been seen binding in one pocket, whereas more promiscuous ligands such as cofactors show moderately improved performance. With this work and benchmark dataset, we aim to accelerate progress in the field by allowing for a more realistic assessment of the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

In spite of this overwhelming disease prevalence and staggering cost, its severe impact on patients lives and intense global research efforts, study of the disease has proved challenging due to its complexity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only four loci potentially associated with the disease, although these results did not statistically replicate between studies. A previous combinatorial analysis study identified a total of 73 genes that were highly associated with two long COVID cohorts in the predominantly (>91%) white European ancestry Sano GOLD population, and we sought to reproduce these findings in the independent and ancestrally more diverse All of Us (AoU) population.

MethodsWe assessed the reproducibility of the 5,343 long COVID disease signatures from the original study in the AoU population. Because the very small population sizes provide very limited power to replicate findings, we initially tested whether we observed a statistically significant enrichment of the Sano GOLD disease signatures that are also positively correlated with long COVID in the AoU cohort after controlling for population substructure.

ResultsFor the Sano GOLD disease signatures that have a case frequency greater than 5% in AoU, we consistently observed a significant enrichment (77% - 83%, p < 0.01) of signatures that are also positively associated with long COVID in the AoU cohort. These encompassed 92% of the genes identified in the original study. At least five of the disease signatures found in Sano GOLD were also shown to be individually significantly associated with increased long COVID prevalence in the AoU population. Rates of signature reproducibility are strongest among self-identified white patients, but we also observe significant enrichment of reproducing disease associations in self-identified black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino cohorts. Signatures associated with 11 out of the 13 drug repurposing candidates identified in the original Sano GOLD study were reproduced in this study.

ConclusionThese results demonstrate the reproducibility of long COVID disease signal found by combinatorial analysis, broadly validating the results of the original analysis. They provide compelling evidence for a much broader array of genetic associations with long COVID than previously identified through traditional GWAS studies. This strongly supports the hypothesis that genetic factors play a critical role in determining an individuals susceptibility to long COVID following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. It also lends weight to the drug repurposing candidates identified in the original analysis. Together these results may help to stimulate much needed new precision medicine approaches to more effectively diagnose and treat the disease.

This is also the first reproduction of long COVID genetic associations across multiple populations with substantially different ancestry distributions. Given the high reproducibility rate across diverse populations, these findings may have broader clinical application and promote better health equity. We hope that this will provide confidence to explore some of these mechanisms and drug targets and help advance research into novel ways to diagnose the disease and accelerate the discovery and selection of better therapeutic options, both in the form of newly discovered drugs and/or the immediate prioritization of coordinated investigations into the efficacy of repurposed drug candidates.","NA","medrxiv",1739052375705

Dopaminergic (DA) neurons project to most brain areas, with particularly dense innervation in the striatum. DA varicosities bind to target striatal synapses and form dopamine hub synapses (DHS). However, the basic features of dopamine release sites are still largely unknown. Here we studied the ultrastructure of fluorescent DA and glutamatergic (GLU) synaptosomes isolated from the striatum of adult mice with cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. We observed that DA synaptosomes display ~10 times fewer vesicles than GLU ones. DA vesicles are bigger and less round. Vesicle organization at single nanometer scale indicates that most GLU synaptosomes have tethered and primed vesicles, indicative of a readily releasable pool, while only 39 % of DA synaptosomes have tethered vesicles, which appear not to be primed. In addition, GLU terminals contacted by DA terminals in DHS have more primed vesicles than others. While DA varicosities do not form genuine synapses, their adhesion to cortico-striatal synapses may convey a local regulation of synaptic release properties.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Methods Patients (n=13) with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 in 2020-2021 donated blood and sputum samples at inclusion and after one year. Symptom and physiological testing data were collected concurrently. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles were analysed longitudinally and compared to pre-pandemic DNAm data from healthy controls. Results While peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed no significant changes, longitudinal DNAm changes were observed in neutrophil- and macrophage-enriched fractions. The changes were significantly associated with symptoms and physiological measures. Pathway analysis showed enrichment for cellular processes involved in cardiac function. Conclusions We identified longitudinal DNAm changes in lung immune cells associated with pathways linked to cardiac function. These changes correlate with symptom burden and heart and lung metrics.

Place cells in CA1 of the hippocampus are crucial for spatial navigation and memories1 but show gradual changes in their preferred firing location over time when exposed to the same environment2-9. This drift occurs despite the fact that the animal maintains the ability to navigate and to perform spatial tasks, suggesting a complex relationship between neural activity and behaviour. Here, we show that while the spatial tuning functions of individual CA1 neurons drift over time, stable space coding prevails at the population level: Representational drift is not random but can be described as a translation and rotation in population state space, which preserves the internal geometry of population activity over time. Compensating for the coordinated translation and rotation allows for drift correction and a recovery of spatial tuning on future days. Moreover, the preserved internal geometry stabilises downstream readout under noisy conditions. We propose that the conserved population geometry might serve as a mechanism by which downstream reader networks achieve effective drift correction and, thus, ameliorate the readout of stable information.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Here, we apply random or sham auditory stimulation during an afternoon nap in a within-subject design to investigate its effects on declarative and procedural memory consolidation and electrical brain activity during sleep. Stimulation led to a specific reduction in slow-wave sleep, a decreased slow-wave count, and impaired declarative recall that correlated with the diminished sleep depth. Furthermore, we observed altered slow-wave traveling dynamics, with stimulation resulting in shorter traveling trajectories with less reach and reduced spatial spread, particularly impacting frontal regions. Disruptions in these features correlated with memory deficits.

No clear experimental design was fully reported in any article. The major problems were 1) extremely small sample sizes (<4/group) in nearly half of the articles, 2) confusion between biological repeats and technical replications, and 3) lack of correction for multiple comparisons. These errors led to major inflation of type I and type II errors.

Relative to other giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea and Chelonoidis abingdonii), we found Jonathan has gene variants in pathways associated with aging, including DNA repair and telomere regulation. Consistent with his advanced age, Jonathan has significant age-related changes in DNA methylation and methylation entropy, compared with a 5-year-old Aldabra individual. Notably, we found that low entropy regions in Jonathans methylome were enriched for genes involved in the electron transport chain. This suggests that high-fidelity transcription of these genes may be crucial for extreme longevity. With this data, we propose a model for aging, that links efficient mitochondrial energy production with nuclear maintenance of low methylation entropy.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The mechanism by which these drugs may assist recovery in addiction, mood disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is still not well understood. Most investigations of the effects of these drugs on brain activity have focussed on cortical resting-state networks, however the striatum is a key reward and motivation hub of the brain and aberrant striatal processing may be part of the pathophysiology of these disorders. Consequently, we investigated striatal connectivity following acute MDMA and LSD administration. Method Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired, and seed-voxel functional connectivity analyses were used with the striatum subdivided into three seed regions: the associative, limbic, and sensorimotor striatum. Within-network connectivity was measured using group mean network maps and whole-brain connectivity (seed-to-voxel) was also examined. Results Neither MDMA nor LSD significantly changed within-network connectivity of any of the three striatal seed regions. However, striatal connectivity with other brain regions was significantly altered with both MDMA and LSD. Most notably, MDMA reduced connectivity between the limbic striatum and the amygdala, while LSD increased connectivity between the associative striatum and the frontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices. Conclusion Changes in connectivity were mostly observed outside the standard striatal networks, consistent with previous findings that psychedelics reduce network modularity or between-network segregation and increase connectivity across standard networks.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Yet, therapeutics targeting mutant forms of chromatin-modifying enzymes have yielded only modest clinical utility, underscoring the difficulty of targeting the epigenomic underpinnings of aberrant gene regulatory networks. Here, we sought to identify novel epigenetic vulnerabilities in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Through phenotypic screens and biochemical analysis, we demonstrated that inhibition of the H3K9 demethylases KDM4A and KDM4C elicits potent, subtype-agnostic cytotoxicity by antagonizing transcriptional networks associated with B-cell identity and epigenetically rewiring heterochromatin. KDM4 demethylases associated with the KRAB zinc finger ZNF587, and their enzymatic inhibition led to DNA replication stress and DNA damage-induced cGAS-STING activation. Broad surveys of transcriptional data from patients also revealed KDM4 family dysregulation in several other cancer types. To explore this potential therapeutic avenue, we performed high-throughput small molecule screens with H3K9me3 nucleosome substrates and identified novel KDM4 demethylase inhibitors. AI-guided protein-ligand binding predictions suggested diverse modes of action for various small molecule hits. Our findings underscore the relevance of targeting fundamental transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms for anti-cancer therapy.

The methodology utilizes molecular docking simulations to predict interactions based on structural compatibility and binding affinity estimations. This approach highlights proteins, such as sodium/myo-inositol cotransporters, which exhibit theoretical high affinity for puberulic acid, suggesting possible competitive inhibition or mimetic interactions that could disrupt osmoregulation. It is important to clarify that these simulations provide a hypothetical framework for understanding potential interactions. The high docking scores do not directly translate to biological effects but serve as a basis for further experimental validation. This cautious interpretation acknowledges the inherent limitations of predictive modeling while maintaining confidence in the robustness of the computational process. Moreover, the exploratory nature of this study is supported by the fact that binding affinity predictions are not influenced by protein amino acid length or the predictive accuracy (pLDDT scores) provided by AlphaFold2. This independence from structural prediction metrics suggests that the docking results offer a reliable exploration of potential interactions across a wide array of proteins, making this approach a valuable asset in the fields of drug discovery and toxicological research. The ability to comprehensively identify candidate proteins with potential affinity to chemical compounds enhances the predictive capacity of toxicological assessments and supports the strategic development of safer pharmaceutical agents.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Mosquito vision plays a role in predator avoidance, mate finding, oviposition, locating vertebrate hosts, and vectoring disease. Recent work has shown that when sensitized to CO2, the visual responses of Aedes aegypti are wavelength-dependent, but little is known about how other olfactory stimuli can modulate visual responses. The visual cues associated with flowers, vertebrate hosts, or oviposition sites differs substantially and it is possible that odors might prime the mosquito visual system to respond to these different resources. To investigate the interplay of olfactory and visual cues, we adapted previously used wind tunnel bioassays to use quasi-monochromatic targets (390-740 nm) created with a novel LED synth. We coupled these visual targets with CO2 and the odors representative of vertebrate hosts, floral nectar or oviposition sites and assessed responses via 3D tracking of female mosquitos. When CO2 alone is present, we observe a lower preference for wavelengths in the green portion of the visible spectrum with a gradual increase as wavelengths moved towards the violet and red ends of the spectrum. However, when odors associated both with flowers and oviposition sites, we observed significant increases in mosquito preference for green (475-575 nm) stimuli. In contrast when vertebrate host odor was present, we saw increased preference for stimuli across the entire visible spectrum. These odor shifts in the mosquito spectral preferences suggest these preferences are not fixed and shift depending on behavioral context.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Here we aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-mediated Drosophila adaptive growth. Since the intestine is the interface of host-microbe interactions, we conducted an analysis of the larval midgut transcriptome in presence or absence of an intestinal Lactobacilli strain representative of the Drosophila microbiota. Among the different biological processes identified, Ecdysone signaling has emerged as a new Lactobacilli-mediated signature. Through functional and morphometrical approaches, we show that, upon bacteria association, intestinal Ecdysone is not rate limiting for the larval systemic plastic growth but required for the adaptation of midgut growth to Lactobacilli. Our results reveal a tissue-specific contribution of the pleiotropic hormone Ecdysone in the control of midgut adaptive growth and maturation.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), which are essential components of the ribosome, are coded by the multi-copy ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Despite its highly conserved function, the rDNA displays substantial variation within all species analysed to date. This variation comprises both inter-individual differences in total copy number (CN) as well as inter- and intragenomic sequence variation in the form of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) across rDNA copies. Whether germline variation of rDNA sequence associates with phenotypic traits in humans is, to date, unknown. Here, using the UK Biobank whole genome sequencing data, we first derive a high confidence list of rDNA-associated SNVs and INDELs that we validate in multiple ways. Using this list, we show that specific rDNA variants associate with several human traits. In particular, traits associated with body size appear enriched in variants within the Expansion Segment 15L region in the 28S rRNA. The strength of these associations does not diminish when accounting for the total rDNA CN of each individual. Our work represents the first large-scale association analysis of human traits with germline sequence variation in the rDNA, a source of human complex trait-relevant genetic variation that has thus far been largely ignored.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

It forms extensive, reciprocal connections with sensory, hippocampal, parahippocampal, prefrontal, and thalamic areas. RSC comprises granular (gRSC) and dysgranular (dRSC) subdivisions with distinct connectivity and functions. Despite its emerging role in behaviour and its implication in memory-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, the nature of its synaptic inputs remains poorly understood. Here, we combined viral anatomical tracing, optogenetic stimulation, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsal subiculum (dSub), and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) to gRSC and dRSC. Strikingly, all recorded RSC pyramidal neurons received ATN input, regardless of subdivision or cortical layer. Activation of ATN inputs evoked significantly larger post-synaptic responses than those from dSub or ACC, though both regions maintained substantial connectivity with RSC. While dSub projections appeared denser in gRSC, synaptic responses were larger in dRSC, albeit with lower input probability. Notably, NMDA receptor-mediated components of RSC excitatory inputs were weaker than expected, potentially explaining the reported inability to induce long-term potentiation in RSC in ex vivo neurophysiology experiments. This is the first study to characterise the synaptic properties of retrosplenial afferents. Our findings highlight the dominant influence of ATN inputs and raise important questions about how RSC's long-range connectivity supports its roles in memory and spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The presence of polyphosphate within these condensates, which we termed HP-bodies, controls Hfq function by selectively stabilizing polyadenylated RNAs involved in transcription and protein translation, and promoting interactions with translation- and RNA-metabolism-associated proteins involved in de novo protein synthesis. Lack of polyphosphate prevents HP-body formation, which increases cell death and significantly hinders recovery from N-starvation. In functional analogy, we demonstrate that polyP contributes specifically to the formation of Processing (P)-bodies in human cell lines, revealing that a single, highly conserved and ancestral polyanion serves as the universal scaffold for functional phase-separated condensate formation across the tree of life.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Over the past decades, single-cell and clonal analyses have revealed substantial functional and molecular heterogeneity within this compartment, challenging the notion that self-renewal is inherently tied to balanced, multi-lineage blood production. However, a cohesive model that explains the relationships among these diverse HSC states remains elusive. Here, we combined single-cell transplantations of over 1,000 highly purified murine long-term HSCs with in-depth phenotyping of their clonal progeny to achieve a detailed, time-resolved understanding of heterogeneous reconstitution outcomes. We identified reconstitution kinetics as an overall unifying metric of HSC functional potency, with the most potent HSCs displaying the greatest delay in hematopoietic reconstitution. Importantly, a progressive acceleration in reconstitution kinetics was also associated with a gradual shift in mature cell production from platelet and erythro-myeloid bias to balanced, and eventually lymphoid bias. Serial single-cell transplantations of HSCs revealed a unidirectional acceleration in reconstitution kinetics accompanied by a gradual decline in functional potency of daughter HSCs, aligning diverse phenotypes along a linear hierarchical trajectory. Mathematical modeling, together with experimental modulation of lineage-biased blood production, demonstrated that apparent lineage biases actually arise from cell-extrinsic feedback regulation and clonal competition between slow- and fast-engrafting clones to occupy the limited compartment sizes of mature lineages. Our study reconciles multiple layers of HSC heterogeneity into a unifying framework, prompting a reevaluation of the meaning of lineage biases in both normal and diseased hematopoiesis, with broad implications for other regenerating tissues during development, homeostasis, and repair.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Vaccinia was historically thought to encode all the proteins required for its replication. However, recent findings have shown that nuclear host proteins are redirected to the cytoplasm to facilitate viral replication. Among these, topoisomerase 2 (TOP2A) and 2{beta} (TOP2B), which mediate nuclear transcription, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation are the most abundant host proteins associated with nascent viral genomes. Here, we investigate the mechanisms driving TOP2A and TOP2B cytoplasmic translocation and their role in viral replication. We found that early viral protein synthesis induces the cytosolic relocalization of both isoforms, which are subsequently recruited to viral factories by an interaction of their C-terminal domains with the viral ligase, A50. TOP2A promotes replication by interacting with the vaccinia DNA replication machinery. In contrast, TOP2B suppresses replication by enhancing the formation of double-stranded RNA and antiviral granules, containing components of the tRNA splicing ligase complex. Our analysis provides new insights into host-pathogen interactions during poxvirus infection and the role of topoisomerase 2 outside of the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

This is an important finding because it paves the way for the identification or engineering of broad-spectrum R proteins capable of recognizing several members of the same structural family. In the Leptosphaeria maculans / rapeseed (Brassica napus) pathosystem, 13 AVR genes have been cloned, of which four encode effectors belonging to the LARS (Leptosphaeria AviRulence and Supressing) structural family that has also been found in thirteen other phytopathogenic fungi. Homologues of the L. maculans AvrLm3 AVR protein, a LARS family member, have been identified in other fungal species, including an AVR protein from Fulvia fulva called Ecp11-1. We have previously shown that Ecp11-1 is recognized by rapeseed varieties carrying the Rlm3 R gene, and that this recognition is masked by the presence of another LARS AVR gene, AvrLm4-7. In this study, we expanded our characterization of the Rlm3 resistance spectrum to putative effectors from Fusarium oxysporum and Zymoseptoria ardabiliae and showed that one effector from F. oxysporum f. sp. narcissi behaves like Ecp11-1, being recognized by Rlm3, and this recognition also being masked by the presence of AvrLm4-7. We finally investigated which protein regions and amino acids were necessary for the recognition of AvrLm3 and Ecp11-1 by Rlm3.

Motivated by these results, this study examines the ""black box"" of such ML methods to understand what signals are being used to infer recombination rates. We find that it is indeed possible to estimate recombination solely using the allele frequency spectrum, and we provide a genealogical interpretation of these results.

We demonstrate the accuracy of such inferences using both simulations and data from humans. These results offer a new way to understand the effects of recombination on patterns of sequence data, as well as providing an example of how the internal workings of ML methods can give insight into biological processes.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The three small-molecule inhibitors of MtbRNAP exhibit strikingly different effects on transcription elongation. In the presence of D-IX216, which inhibits RNAP active-center bridge-helix motions required for nucleotide addition, the enzyme exhibits transitions between slowly and super-slowly elongating inhibited states. Stl, which inhibits the RNAP trigger-loop motions also required for nucleotide addition, inhibits RNAP primarily by inducing pausing and backtracking.

The emergence of spatial omics technologies, including spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, has enabled the integration of molecular and histological features within tissues. Analyzing these multimodal data presents unique challenges, including variable resolutions, imperfect tissue alignment, and limited or variable spatial coverage. To address these issues, we introduce CORAL, a probabilistic deep generative model that leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn expressive, integrated representations of multimodal spatial omics data. CORAL deconvolves low-resolution spatial data into high-resolution single-cell profiles and detects functional spatial domains. It also characterizes cell-cell interactions and elucidates disease-relevant spatial features. Validated on synthetic data and experimental datasets, including Stero-CITE-seq data from mouse thymus, and paired CODEX and Visium data from hepatocellular carcinoma, CORAL demonstrates robustness and versatility. In hepatocellular carcinoma, CORAL uncovered key immune cell subsets that drive the failure of response to immunotherapy, highlighting its potential to advance spatial single-cell analyses and accelerate translational research.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The cells rapidly stabilized chromosome ends by de novo telomere formation and the new centromeres spread among genes without altering their expression. When both 4a and 4b chromosomes were present in a homozygous state, they segregated through meiosis indistinguishably from wild-type, and gave rise to healthy plants with normal seed set. This work leverages synthetic centromeres to engineer chromosome fission, effectively raising the diploid chromosome number of maize from 20 to 22.

How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1 305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5-100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows microarchitectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimers disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

We demonstrate that endowing CAR T cells with ectopic interleukin-9 (IL-9) signaling by co-expressing an IL-9 receptor, rewires CAR T cell fate under antigen stress to enhance anti-tumor efficacy. In preclinical solid tumor models, IL-9-signaling CAR T cells exhibit increased expansion, persistence, and tumor infiltration, resulting in superior tumor control at significantly lower doses than conventional products. Trajectory and RNA velocity analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data reveal that IL-9 signaling alters CAR T cell differentiation under antigen stress away from dysfunction, favoring a multipotent transition toward CD8+ cell memory and effector states, and promoting a CD4+ cell proliferative state. Interrogation of transcription factor pathways indicates that IL-9-mediated activation of STAT1 and STAT4 drives the superior phenotype of IL-9-signaling CAR T cells, providing a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting solid cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

However, the mechanisms for IL-33 secretion and regulation in the context of chronic airway disease is poorly understood.

ObjectivesWe sought to define how a disease associated isoform IL-33{Delta}34 that escapes nuclear sequestration and is tonically secreted from epithelial cells can be recruited to non-canonical secretory pathways.

MethodsIL-33{Delta}34 interaction with HSP70 was assessed and validated by affinity purification, mass-spectrometry and miniTurboID proximity labeling. Secretion and activity reporter assays were used to probe the effect of HSP70 on epithelial IL-33{Delta}34 secretion and receptor binding. Human airway disease biospecimens were analyzed for dysregulation of heat shock pathways revealing modulation of TCP1 complex intermediates.

Measurements and Main ResultsWe confirmed that HSP70 interacts directly with IL-33{Delta}34, recruits the cytokine to a vesicular compartment and enhances stability upon secretion. IL-33, HSP70 and other key mediators of proteostasis were found to be dysregulated in airway disease biospecimens and secreted extracellular vesicles. The IL-33{Delta}34 interactome was characterized and novel secretion modulators were identified.

ConclusionsThis study confirms a role for HSP70 in non-canonical IL-33{Delta}34 secretion and function that may be amenable for therapeutic targeting in airway diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Many actin probes have been developed to visualize F-actin architectures in eukaryotic cells. However, it is known that double-stained images of F-actin obtained by two different types of actin probes often show partial inconsistencies. While developing actin probes, we observed that the merged images of three distinct actin probes, each labeled with a different fluorescent dye (red, green and blue), enabled various F-actin architectures to be distinguished based on color. This differentiation arises from slight variations in the distribution of each actin probe, and results in a unique color combination of actin probes that reflects the relative intensities of the three fluorescent dyes. In this report, we introduce a new cell staining method, named Actin Painting, which exploits the unique affinity of actin-binding molecules in each actin probe to F-actin architectures. This technique allows the classification of various cell types based on their specific actin cytoskeleton.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

To address this, we investigated hippocampal activity in 5xFAD model mice performing a continuous spatial alternation task, combining behavioural assessment with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. Young 5xFAD mice exhibited mild performance deficits, which worsened with age. Older 5xFAD mice showed significant impairments in task acquisition and alternation accuracy, with significant behavioural hyperactivity. Hippocampal CA1 neurons in 5xFAD mice showed early impairments in spatial representation, prior to showing behavioural deficits. Both young and old 5xFAD mice exhibited reduced spatial tuning, fewer place cells, and decreased trial-to-trial reliability in comparison to wildtype sibling controls. Additionally, 5xFAD mice demonstrated disrupted spatial encoding of reward locations, with reduced spatial correlation between correct and error trials. Analysis of hippocampal ""splitter"" cells revealed reduced splitting activity in 5xFAD mice, with reduced discriminability and reliability of trajectory-dependent activity. These deficits correlated with poorer task performance, suggesting that disrupted contextual encoding contributes to cognitive decline in AD. Our findings highlight early disruptions in hippocampal spatial and contextual encoding in 5xFAD mice, which precede behavioural impairments and provide insights into AD pathophysiology.

Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) utilises the pathogenicity island-encoded Accessory -arabinose Uptake (Aau) transporter to effectively colonise the mouse gut, hypothesised to be achieved via an enhanced capacity to scavenge -arabinose. Aau is regulated exclusively in response to -arabinose, but it is unclear how this system specifically benefits EHEC in vivo. Here, we show that Aau displays a >200-fold higher affinity for the monosaccharide D-ribulose, over -arabinose. EHEC cannot grow on D-ribulose as a sole carbon source and this sugar does not trigger aau transcription. However, Aau effectively transports D-ribulose into the cell only in the presence of -arabinose, where it feeds into the pentose phosphate pathway, after phosphorylation by the -ribulokinase AraB, thus providing EHEC a significant fitness advantage. EHEC has therefore evolved a mechanism of hijacking the canonical -arabinose utilisation machinery to promote D-ribulose utilisation in vivo. Furthermore, Citrobacter rodentium encodes an analogous system that exclusively transports D-ribulose and metabolises it via a dedicated D-ribulokinase. These unique mechanisms of D-ribulose utilisation suggest that convergent evolution has driven the ability of distinct pathogenic species to exploit this nutrient during invasion of the gut niche.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

To make strides towards this goal in a rapidly changing, exemplar marine ecosystem, the Baltic Sea, we studied basin-scale nitrifier spatio-temporal dynamics, coupled with enrichment-enabled comparative genomics. Based on metagenomes and rRNA gene sequencing, we found nitrifiers to be persistently relatively abundant throughout deep depths (>25 m), and from late-fall to spring in surface waters, as revealed by twice-weekly sampling across two years in the southwest Baltic Sea surface waters. In these surface waters, we observed time-lagged dynamics between ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers, which were positively correlated with nitrite, nitrate, and diverse other prokaryotes, and negatively correlated with day length, light, and chlorophyll. For the dominant nitrifiers, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), we enriched five novel species including the dominant deep Baltic Sea species, and obtained genomes from all dominant AOA phylotypes. Among these genomes, which enabled fine-scale niche-differentiation, we observed a high degree of gene conservation, with most differences related to genes associated with interactions with the external environment, including genes involved in signal transduction, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and inorganic ion transport, indicating these may be the primary drivers of strain-variability. We also observed differences in nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism between two dominant surface types. Together our study provides key insights into the niche of nitrifiers, and begins the process of understanding the mechanisms and functional implications of these patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Somatic mutations can lead cancers and possibly contribute to aging phenotypes. Prevailing wisdom suggests somatic mutations are limited by evolved defences, either targeting DNA or post-mutational cellular states. Here, I analyse simple models for metazoans and humans in particular, incorporating the possibility that mutation rate trades off of organism longevity, defined as the age at which natural selection becomes negligible. The models assume selection acts to reduce mutation rate and prevent disease, both of which contribute to selecting for longer lifespan. We detail equilibrium conditions and find coevolutionary oscillations under certain parameter combinations. Notably, disease prevention can lead to mutational tolerance and this can contribute to explaining empirical cross-species patterns in longevity vs. mutation rate. We conclude that mutational disease and cancer in particular have required characteristics to be mediators of mutation rate-lifespan coevolution. The mutational tolerance that results from this coevolution can contribute to explaining the incidences of other diseases and conditions, including aging.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The exact mechanism leading to this loss of mechanosensitvity is still unclear, making developing effective treatment challenging. Current treatments mostly focus on preventing bone mass loss (such as bisphosphonates) or promoting bone formation (such as Sclerostin inhibitors) to limit the decline of bones mass. However, treatments do not target the cause of bone mass loss which may be, in part, due to the bones inability to initiate a normal bone mechanapdatation response. In this work, we investigated the effects of 2 weeks of tibia loading, and Piezo1 agonist injection in vivo on 22-month-old mouse bone adaptation response. We used an optimized loading profile, which induced high fluid flow velocity and low strain magnitude in adult mouse tibia. We found that tibia loading and Yoda2 injection have an additive effect on increasing cortical bone parameters in 22-month-old mice.

This method enables the simultaneous analysis of cellular transcriptomes and adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoires within their native spatial context. We applied AIR-SPACE to mouse popliteal lymph nodes at five distinct time points after Vaccinia virus footpad infection and constructed a comprehensive map of the developing adaptive immune response. Our analysis revealed heterogeneous activation niches, characterized by Interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma}) production, during the early stages of infection. At later stages, we delineated sub-anatomical structures within the germinal center (GC) and observed evidence that antibody-producing plasma cells differentiate and exit the GC through the dark zone. Furthermore, by combining clonotype data with spatial lineage tracing, we demonstrate that B cell clones are shared among multiple GCs within the same lymph node, reinforcing the concept of a dynamic, interconnected network of GCs. Overall, our study demonstrates how AIR-SPACE can be used to gain insight into the spatial dynamics of infection responses within lymphoid organs.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

To assess differences within the basin, we subdivided the Mediterranean Sea into three subregions - Western, Eastern and Adriatic. Our work revealed significant climatic and anthropogenic impacts on three species: the banded-dye murex, the Atlantic bluefin tuna and the gilthead sea bream. Climate change, particularly temperature changes, influenced the abundance and body size of Atlantic bluefin tuna, while subregional differences in the stable isotopic composition of archaeological skeletal material reflected shifts in the system's primary productivity. Human activities, particularly overexploitation, impacted the abundance of both banded-dye murex and Atlantic bluefin tuna, as well as the body size of gilthead sea bream and Atlantic bluefin tuna. These results highlight the significance of studying the relationships between climate, human activities, and marine resources in this large marine ecosystem.

What makes a macrophage trogocytose instead of phagocytose is not clear. Using both CD47 antibodies and a Her2 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) to induce phagocytosis, we found that macrophages preferentially trogocytose adherent target cells instead of phagocytose in both 2D cell monolayers and 3D cancer spheroid models. Disrupting target cell integrin using an RGD peptide or through CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of the V integrin subunit in target cells increased macrophage phagocytosis. Conversely, increasing cell adhesion by ectopically expressing E-Cadherin in Raji B cell targets reduced phagocytosis. Finally, we examined phagocytosis of mitotic cells, a naturally occurring example of cells with reduced adhesion. Arresting target cells in mitosis significantly increased phagocytosis.

Consequently, failure in one trial may increase the likelihood of failure in subsequent trials. If this pattern emerges, successive failures (SFs) are not merely events to be avoided but part of the trial-and-error process of identifying optimal movements, which can facilitate motor learning. This study investigated whether and how SFs occur above chance levels during a motor learning task with binary success/failure feedback and explored the relationship between SFs and motor learning outcomes. Thirty-three healthy young adults participated in the study, performing a reaching task to pass through a target without visual feedback of their hand position. Binary feedback was provided after each trial, indicating whether the hand trajectory overlapped with the target. The results showed that the probability of two SFs was significantly higher than the square of the overall failure probability, indicating that failure streaks occurred above chance levels. A computational model, in which motor variability comprised constant motor noise and exploratory variability regulated by recent reward history (where variability increased following failure), successfully explained SF emergence. However, the learning index, defined as the difference in failure probability between the first and latter halves of the experiment, was unrelated to SF emergence. Additionally, failure streaks disappeared when participants were asked to reach one of seven randomly selected targets in each trial, suggesting that introducing environmental variability can help alleviate SFs.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

While training CNNs on brain-relevant object-recognition tasks may be an important pre-requisite to predict brain activity, the CNN's brain-like architecture alone may already allow for accurate prediction of neural activity. Here, we evaluated the performance of both task-optimized and brain-optimized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in predicting neural responses across visual cortex, and performed systematic architectural manipulations and comparisons between trained and untrained feature extractors to reveal key structural components influencing model performance. For human and monkey area V1, random-weight CNNs employing the ReLU activation function, combined with either average or max pooling, significantly outperformed other activation functions. Random-weight CNNs matched their trained counterparts in predicting V1 responses. The extent to which V1 responses can be predicted correlated strongly with the neural network's complexity, which reflects the non-linearity of neural activation functions and pooling operations. However, this correlation between encoding performance and complexity was significantly weaker for higher visual areas that are classically associated with object recognition, such as monkey IT. To test whether this difference between visual areas reflects functional differences, we trained neural network models on both texture discrimination and object recognition tasks. %, and analyzed the relationship between model complexity and task performance. Consistent with our hypothesis, model complexity correlated more strongly with performance on texture discrimination than object recognition. Our findings indicate that random-weight CNNs with sufficient model complexity allow for comparable prediction of V1 activity as trained CNNs, while higher visual areas require precise weight configurations acquired through training via gradient descent.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Human centromeres are defined primarily by a unique chromatin domain featuring the histone H3 variant, Centromere Protein A (CENP-A), that marks a single active centromere locus per chromosome. CENP-A chromatin typically occupies a small subregion of low DNA methylation within multi-megabase arrays of hypermethylated alpha-satellite repeats and constitutive pericentric heterochromatin. However, the mechanisms defining and maintaining precise centromere position and domain size, and the role of the underlying alpha satellite DNA sequence, are poorly characterised. Using an experimentally-induced neocentromere in RPE1 cells, we discovered that the SUV39H1 and H2 methyltransferases tri-methylate H3K9 at neocentromere boundaries to maintain CENP-A domain size independent of DNA methylation or satellite sequences. Furthermore, we found that the CENP-A domain at canonical alpha-satellite-based centromeres is characterized by local depletion of H3K9me3-mediated heterochromatin, coinciding with the DNA methylation dip region. We identified the SETDB1 methyltransferase as key to maintaining H3K9me3 within flanking active higher order alpha satellite arrays while SUV39s and SUZ12 contribute to globally heterochromatinize both alpha satellites and neighbouring repeats. Loss of this heterochromatin boundary results in the progressive expansion of the primary CENP-A domain, erosion of DNA methylation, and the nucleation of new centromeres across alpha satellite sequences. Our study identifies the functional specialization of different H3K9 methyltransferases across centromeric and pericentric domains, crucial for maintaining centromere domain size and number.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Here we describe a general deep learning-based design approach for solubilizing native membrane proteins while preserving their sequence, fold, and function using genetically encoded de novo protein WRAPs (Water-soluble RFdiffused Amphipathic Proteins) that surround the lipid-interacting hydrophobic surfaces, rendering them stable and water-soluble without the need for detergents. We design WRAPs for both beta-barrel outer membrane and helical multi-pass transmembrane proteins, and show that the solubilized proteins retain the binding and enzymatic functions of the native targets with enhanced stability. Syphilis vaccine development has been hindered by difficulties in characterizing and producing the outer membrane protein antigens; we generated soluble versions of four Treponema pallidum outer membrane beta barrels which are potential syphilis vaccine antigens. A 4.0 [A] cryo-EM map of WRAPed TP0698 is closely consistent with the design model. WRAPs should be broadly useful for facilitating biochemical and structural characterization of integral membrane proteins, enabling therapeutic discovery by screening against purified soluble targets, and generating antigenically intact immunogens for vaccine development.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Models of protein complexes provide important insights into interaction mechanisms, but their interpretation can be difficult if they lack fine structural detail, which is often the case in experimental and predicted models.

ResultsHere I show that AlphaFold3 often fails to predict protein complexes that are either weak, or dependent on the presence of a cofactor that is not included in a prediction. To address this problem, I developed gapTrick, an AlphaFold2-based approach that uses multimeric templates to improve prediction reliability. The tool uses AlphaFold2 neural network models trained on single-chain proteins, which reduces training-set bias and allows for an extensive validation using a large benchmark set of protein complexes. I show that gapTrick improves predictions of the weak and incomplete complexes based on low-accuracy templates, such as separate protein chains rigid-body fitted into cryo-EM reconstruction of a complex. I also show that it identifies with very high precision residue-residue interactions that are critical for complex formation. The approach can aid in the interpretation of challenging experimental structures and the computational identification of protein-protein interactions.

Availability and implementationThe gapTrick source code is available at https://github.com/gchojnowski/gapTrick and requires only a standard AlphaFold2 installation to run. The repository also provides a Colab notebook that can be used to run gapTrick without installing it on the user's computer.

Convergent evidence suggests that neurodevelopment proceeds in a hierarchical manner, characterized by heterogeneous maturation patterns across brain regions and networks. However, the maturation of the intrinsic spatiotemporal propagations of brain activity remains largely unexplored. This study aims to bridge this gap by delineating spatiotemporal propagations from childhood to early adulthood. By leveraging a recently developed approach that captures time-lag dynamic propagations, we characterized intrinsic dynamic propagations along three axes: sensory-association (S-A),  task-positive to default networks (TP-D), and somatomotor-visual (SM-V) networks, which progress towards adult-like brain dynamics from childhood to early adulthood. Importantly, we demonstrated that as participants mature, there is a prolonged occurrence of the S-A and TP-D propagation states, indicating that they spend more time in these states. Conversely, the prevalence of SM-V propagation states declines during development. Notably, top-down propagations along the S-A axis exhibited an age-dependent increase in occurrence, serving as a superior predictor of cognitive scores compared to bottom-up S-A propagation. These findings were replicated across two independent cohorts (N = 677 in total), emphasizing the robustness and generalizability of these findings. Our results provide new insights into the emergence of adult-like functional dynamics during youth and their role in supporting cognition.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

To enable practical application, we integrated Plexus with a scalable experimental system utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons equipped with the GCaMP6m calcium indicator and CRISPR interference machinery. This integrated platform successfully identified nearly twice as many distinct phenotypic changes in response to genetic perturbations compared to conventional methods, as demonstrated in a 52-gene CRISPRi screen across multiple iPSC lines. Using this framework, we identified potential genetic modifiers of aberrant neuronal activity in frontotemporal dementia, illustrating its utility for understanding complex neurological disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

Recently, the development of alternative methods, such as CUT&Tag, have provided researchers with alternative strategies that eliminate the need for chromatin purification, and allow for in situ investigation of histone modifications and chromatin bound factors. Mindful of technical differences, we set out to investigate whether distinct chromatin modifications were equally compatible with these different chromatin interrogation techniques. We found that ChIP-Seq and CUT&Tag performed similarly for modifications known to reside at gene regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, but major differences were observed when we assessed enrichment over heterochromatin-associated loci. Unlike ChIP-Seq, CUT&Tag detects robust levels of H3K9me3 at a substantial number of repetitive elements, with especially high sensitivity over evolutionarily young retrotransposons. IAPEz-int elements for example, exhibited underrepresentation in mouse ChIP-Seq datasets but strong enrichment using CUT&Tag. Additionally, we identified several euchromatin-associated proteins that co-purify with repetitive loci and are similarly depleted when applying ChIP-based methods. This study reveals that our current knowledge of chromatin states across the heterochromatin portions of the mammalian genome is extensively incomplete, largely due to limitations of ChIP-Seq. We also demonstrate that newer in situ chromatin fragmentation-based techniques, such as CUT&Tag and CUT&RUN, are more suitable for studying chromatin modifications over repetitive elements and retrotransposons.

HighlightsIn situ fragmentation overcomes biases produced by ChIP-Seq.

Heterochromatic regions of the genome are lost to the insoluble pellet during ChIP-Seq.

CUT&Tag allows for mapping chromatin features at young repetitive elements.

Euchromatin-associated regulatory factors co-purify with insoluble heterochromatin.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

While the triggers of NETosis in atherosclerotic plaque are well-characterized, the mechanisms underlying NET degradation and clearance remain unclear. Moreover, the impact of impaired NET clearance on atherosclerosis progression have not been elucidated. Here we show that macrophages are critical for the release of DNases, which degrade NETs. We identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated activation of PERK-ATF4 pathway as a key driver of impaired macrophage DNase secretion, leading to delayed NET clearance and their persistence. Elevated NET levels trigger cleavage of the efferocytosis receptor Mertk leading to defective macrophage efferocytosis and exacerbation of plaque necrosis. Human atherosclerotic plaques and Ldlr-/- mice treated with ISRIB, a PERK inhibitor, show enhanced DNase secretion and clearance of NETs. Together, the identification of key mechanisms of NET clearance in atherosclerosis offers new therapeutic strategies to stabilize plaques.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The hippocampus plays a key role in mismatch detection, but it is not known what information the hippocampus uses to form expectations. Here we show that the human hippocampus bases its expectations on episodic memories and not generalised schematic knowledge. Across three fMRI experiments, we demonstrate that the hippocampus is selectively engaged by mismatches with episodic memories of specific events. In contrast, mismatches with schematic knowledge activate regions of the Semantic Control and Multiple Demand Networks, as well as subcortical regions involved in prediction error signalling. Notably, mismatches with episodic memories also engage the Default Mode Network. Overall, our findings provide direct support for some models of learning via mismatch detection and refute models that propose the hippocampus plays a wider role as a more generalised mismatch detector.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The pathophysiologic mechanisms of this complex disease are poorly understood. Beyond the described symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, myalgias, among others, Long COVID can affect the patients ability to work and function in society compared to their baseline. Frailty is defined as the decline of physiologic reserve that leads to increased vulnerability to stressors and poor health outcomes. Our study aimed to examine the characteristics of frailty seen in patients with Long COVID compared to the frailty seen in aging patients with multimorbidity.

MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). The data used to calculate the Fried phenotype through the Johns Hopkins frailty calculator was collected from two separate clinics, a Long COVID clinic and a Geriatric Frailty clinic. We obtained the VA Frailty Index from VA CDW (Corporate Data Warehouse).

ResultsWe included 106 patients from the Long COVID clinic and 97 from the frailty clinic. Patients from the Long COVID clinic were significantly younger than those from the frailty clinic (60{+/-}12.6 vs.. 79.8{+/-}5.8, p<0.01). In the standard frailty group, weakness and slowness were the predominant features present in both the frail and pre-frail groups, with increasing exhaustion and lower activity in the frail group. Patients with frailty in the Long COVID group experienced exhaustion and low activity at a higher rate than those in the Geriatric frailty clinic.

ConclusionsLong COVID may predispose patients to develop a subtype of frailty (""post-viral frailty"") that presents with a higher frequency of exhaustion and low activity. This frailty appears phenotypically different from the frailty encountered in geriatric patients with multimorbidity, which presents more often with slowness and weakness as the initial drivers.","NA","medrxiv",1739052375705

Phenological associations between deciduous trees, phytophagous insects and their consumers (passerine birds) have become one of the model systems for understanding this process. However, most existing research reports population-level associations rather than examining the smaller spatial scales at which these trophic interactions occur. Furthermore, a variety of methods have been used to measure phenology, particularly on producers and primary consumers, with little formal comparison. To investigate how different methods of measuring producer and primary consumer phenology influence our understanding of these biological relationships at the appropriate scale, we quantified phenological metrics for individual host trees and the phytophagous insects that depend on them in a deciduous woodland during spring 2023. We sampled 170 trees from six deciduous species in Wytham Woods, UK, deriving nine metrics of phenology from five distinct field methods: multispectral drone imaging (NDVI), hemispherical canopy photography, and bud-scoring observations to track tree phenology, as well as water traps and frass traps to monitor insect herbivore phenology. We assessed the reliability of these methods within both trophic levels and across tree species. We further evaluated the extent to which tree phenology metrics best correlated with herbivore phenology, at the level of individual trees and links to variation in subsequent herbivory rates across a subsample of 72 oak (Quercus robur) trees. Our results illustrate how methodological choices can affect our ability to study the timing of trophic interactions and reveal fine-scale spatiotemporal variation in phenology across both trophic levels. We discuss the implications of these results for considering how the scale-dependence of trophic interactions may stabilise populations and shape broader-scale responses to environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

This suggests that simple tractography techniques might not be sensitive enough to identify language dominance. Significant insights into the functional organization of the human brain may be achieved by considering networks and brain connectivity, providing more information about discrepancies in people with different hemispheric language dominance. In this study, we examined 285 healthy participants compare their structural connectomes at the whole-brain level and determine the networks responsible for the three different functional language lateralisation groups (typical, atypical and strongly atypical). Probabilistic tractography generated whole-brain tractograms, and white matter fibres were filtered according to anatomical Boolean guidelines. Connectivity matrices with nodes corresponding to supramodal sentence areas in the language atlas and edges weighted by fractional anisotropy (FA) were generated to compare the groups using graph theory and network-based statistic (NBS) approaches. We demonstrated that both atypical (bilateral) and strongly atypical (right-lateralised) lateralisation are characterised by heightened interhemispheric temporal connectivity. Post-hoc analyses showed that strongly atypical individuals exhibited increased temporo-frontal connectivity, while atypical individuals had enhanced temporal and frontal connectivity but lacked temporo-frontal connections. These connectivity patterns diverge from traditional models of hemispheric dominance, suggesting a reliance on integrated bilateral networks in atypically lateralised individuals. This reflects distinct neural mechanisms underlying atypical language organisation, departing from developmental trajectory of typical lateralisation and offering insights into cognitive flexibility and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

However, while myriad studies have investigated relationships between MGEs and variation in fitness among microbial and eukaryotic hosts, few studies have incorporated this variation into the context of MGE evolution and ecology. Combining HiC-resolved metagenomics with the model honey bee worker gut microbiome, we show that the worker gut contains a dense, nested MGE community that exhibits a wide degree of host range variation among microbial hosts. Using measures of gene similarity and syntenty, we show that plasmids likely mediate gene flow between individual honey bee colonies, though these plasmids exhibit broad host range variation within their individual microbiomes. We further show that phage-microbe networks exhibit high variation among individual metagenomes, and that phages show broad host range with respect to both the number and phylogenetic distance of their hosts. Finally, we provide evidence that measures of nucleotide variation positively correlate with host range in bee-associated phages, and that functional targets of diversifying selection are partitioning differently between broad or narrow host range phages. Our work underscores the variability of MGE x microbial interactions within host-associated microbial communities and highlights the genomic variation associated with MGE host range diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

The goal of this project was to develop an automated rating of shopping baskets based on their health properties that can be deployed on top of existing loyalty or digital shopping basket programs by retailers without knowing for how long a basket will last or how many people consume it.

MethodsWe developed a model that uses nutrient densities as opposed to absolute quantities based on self-reported food intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as well as mortality follow-up data and conducted a validation against the Nutri-Score as well as the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI).

ResultsThe model we obtained punishes consuming calories from sugar and saturated fats, high salt intake, as well as consuming calories from beverages. Furthermore, a penalty is applied to a nutrition that is deficient in protein, vitamin C, or iron. Fiber consumption is rewarded. The model showed a high degree of correlation with the Nutri-Score (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.60) and the AHEI (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.62 for the AHEI without the protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption and -0.60 with it).

ConclusionsThe proposed model is aligned with the recommendations formulated in nutritional guidelines, which is indicated by a high degree of correlation with the AHEI.

Studies on host immune responses to infection have mostly targeted mechanisms of resistance, and consequently, these are now well-described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. By comparison, the mechanistic basis of disease tolerance is less well understood. This is in part because both processes interact and can be difficult to separate under an infection scenario. Using the highly tractable insect model Drosophila melanogaster exposed to its natural entomopathogen, Pseudomonas entomophila, we aimed to tease apart mechanisms of disease tolerance from those of resistance. To this aim, we reasoned that oral exposure to heat-killed entomopathogenic bacteria should require disease tolerance without relying on resistance. Using this method, we observe that oral exposure to heat-killed P. entomophila causes mortality and reduced fecundity in D. melanogaster. We confirm that this reduction in fitness-related traits depends on the duration of the exposure, is sexually dimorphic, and is dependent on the virulence of the bacterium. We also found the microbiota to play a role, with its presence exacerbating the deleterious effect on host survival. This experimental framework, which may be extended to other systems, can be instrumental towards an understanding of the molecular, genetic, and physiological basis of disease tolerance and its interactions with resistance mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1739052375705

In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties.
