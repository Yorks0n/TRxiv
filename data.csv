However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall. This relationship was specific to the music condition and persisted when we controlled for a proxy measure of initial encoding strength (spatial intersubject correlation), suggesting that music-evoked reactivation may play a role in making event memories stick that is distinct from what happens at initial encoding.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics of both epigenome and transcriptome underlying mammalian embryogenesis, revealing details in sequence, cell type, and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to DNA cytosine methylation for a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology over development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

However, the mechanisms by which pathogens hijack helper NLR pathways are poorly understood. Here, we show that an effector from the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans bridges the host protein NbTOL9a, a putative member of the host ESCRT pathway, to a helper NLR to suppress immunity. In this work, we solved the crystal structure of the RXLR-LWY effector AVRcap1b in complex with the ENTH domain of NbTOL9a. The structure revealed that unlike other RXLR-LWY effectors, AVRcap1b has a novel L-shaped fold and defines a new structural family of effectors in the Phytophthora genus. Moreover, we defined the AVRcap1b/NbTOL9a binding interface and designed effector mutants that don't bind NbTOL9a, impairing immune suppression. This indicates that ENTH binding is required for full virulence activity of this effector. Lastly, we show that AVRcap1b associates specifically with activated NbNRC2 independently of NbTOL9a binding. This suggests that the effector functions as a bridge that interconnects NbNRC2 with the NbTOL9a pathway. These results illustrate an unprecedented pathogen mechanism to hijack helper NLR pathways and suppress immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

In this work, we introduce Chai-2, a multimodal generative model that achieves a 16% hit rate in fully de novo antibody design, representing an over 100-fold improvement compared to previous computational methods. We prompt Chai-2 to design <=20 antibodies or nanobodies to 52 diverse targets, completing the workflow from AI design to wet-lab validation in under two weeks. Crucially, none of these targets have a preexisting antibody or nanobody binder in the Protein Data Bank. Remarkably, in just a single round of experimental testing, we find at least one successful hit for 50% of targets, often with strong affinities and favorable drug-like profiles. Beyond antibody design, Chai-2 achieves a 68% wet-lab success rate in miniprotein design -- routinely yielding picomolar binders. The high success rate of Chai-2 enables rapid experimental validation and characterization of novel antibodies in under two weeks, paving the way toward a new era of rapid and precise atomic-level molecular engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

The heterodimeric SOD comprises a catalytic SOD2 and a non-catalytic SOD1 anchoring it to the conserved stromal PSI surface near the ferredoxin-binding site with four contact areas. Structural comparison with plants and algae shows that SOD could occupy a similar position via interactions with PsaD. C. velia PSI displays several distinct features, including a split subunit PsaA linked by PsaV, a unique iso-fucoxanthin bound to PsaB, and an extended PsaF coordinating an extra chlorophyll in the membrane. The antenna includes five fucoxanthin-chlorophyll family proteins (FCPs) stabilized by adaptations unique to each antenna protein.

The majority of described species are arthropods, which tend to be small and require taxonomic expertise to identify to species level. Therefore, the ability to collect and preserve specimens in a suitable way for long read and Hi-C data generation using very simple approaches with minimal infrastructure is certain to be important in scaling up reference genome generation. Using Anopheles mosquitoes as an insect representative we evaluate how well different preservation liquids protect high molecular weight DNA, RNA, and nuclei for Hi-C when mosquitoes are held intact versus slightly squished. We find that squished samples stored in 100% ethanol and Allprotect held at room temperature for one week result in excellent preservation of both high molecular weight DNA and nuclei for Hi-C. Other tested buffers, including RNAlater, EDTA at several pHs, and DMSO Salt Solution (DESS) performed satisfactorily for long read data generation and RNA retrieval, but less ideally for Hi-C, which may have bigger negative impacts when aiming to generate data for organisms with larger genomes. Field collections requiring dry ice or dry shippers can be logistically challenging to arrange, are notoriously expensive, and DNA degrades rapidly if ultra-cold temperature is not maintained, which is devastating given how expensive and time consuming field work can be. Here we present multiple viable options for room temperature collection and/or shipment for arthropod samples. Further exploration across a broader range of species will hopefully enable cheaper and more widely available reference genome generation globally.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

We aimed to characterize pathways of clinical progression associated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections using data from patients in an integrated healthcare system, whose encounters were monitored across all levels of acuity spanning virtual, ambulatory, and inpatient care settings. Using parametric survival models, we estimated probabilities of progression and distributions of time to progression from each care setting to all higher-acuity settings on a cascade encompassing the following classes of events or healthcare encounters: symptoms onset; diagnostic testing; telehealth or other virtual care appointment; outpatient physician office visit; urgent care presentation; emergency department presentation; hospital admission; mechanical ventilation; and death. Our analyses included data from 59,668, 22,705, and 1,668 episodes associated with positive SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV tests, respectively, between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. First clinical encounters occurred in inpatient settings for only 4.7%, 3.4%, and 18.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes, respectively, with median times (interquartile range) of 6.8 (3.6-13.2), 6.6 (3.5-12.1), and 6.4 (3.8-10.6) days from symptoms onset to admission. Overall, 7.9% of SARS-CoV-2 episodes, 5.8% of influenza episodes, and 33.8% of RSV episodes resulted in inpatient admission, ventilation, or death. Between 40.4-62.1%, 71.6-87.3%, and 47.9-58.7% of SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV infections, respectively, had encounters in lower-acuity virtual care, outpatient, or urgent care settings. For all three viruses, the proportions of cases receiving care at each level of acuity increased with older age and greater numbers of comorbid conditions. Median durations of hospital stay were 4.2 (2.6-7.3), 4.0 (2.3-6.8), and 4.3 (2.5-7.4) days for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV episodes resulting in admission. These estimates provide a basis for modeling real-world clinical care requirements and the progression of respiratory viral infections.

AUTHOR SUMMARYModels of respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV are used to forecast disease burden and plan the allocation of healthcare resources. Early healthcare system encounters--for instance, for receipt of care in virtual or outpatient settings--may provide a basis for anticipating higher-acuity care requirements as patients progress to more severe disease. However, limited data are available addressing patterns of healthcare utilization among patients with these infections. Using electronic healthcare records from an integrated healthcare system, we estimated probabilities and rates of progression from lower-acuity states, such as virtual or outpatient visits, to increasingly higher-acuity states including inpatient admission, ventilation, and death. We quantified associations of demographic and clinical risk factors with progression probabilities for each infection. We provide a databank containing fitted distributions for progression to inform infectious disease modeling.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

Although RXLR-EER motifs are critical for host translocation and are cleaved prior to secretion, the relevance of this processing is poorly understood. Prior evidence suggests RXLR effectors utilize a distinct, unconventional secretion pathway, raising the question of whether the RXLR-EER motifs influence selection of the secretion route. Here, we combined genetic, molecular and cell biology approaches to investigate the secretion pathways of RXLR effectors. Confocal microscopy revealed that RXLR and apoplastic effectors localize to distinct vesicular compartments in cultured hyphae. Moreover, fusing the ER retention signal KDEL to RXLR effectors did not impair their secretion, in contrast to apoplastic effectors, which were retained in the endomembrane system, indicating that RXLR effectors bypass the canonical ER-to-Golgi pathway. Importantly, RXLR effectors associate with extracellular vesicles, whereas RXLR-EER motif mutants show reduced association and are rerouted through the ER-to-Golgi secretion pathway. These findings demonstrate that the RXLR-EER motif governs effector sorting into an unconventional, EV-linked secretion route. This study sheds light on the molecular basis of effector trafficking in P. infestans and underscores the potential role of EVs in delivering virulence factors during host colonization.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

However, failing to correct for multiple testing in case-control studies using IBD segments can lead to false discoveries. We propose the difference between case-case and control-control IBD rates as an IBD mapping statistic. For our hypothesis test, we use a computationally efficient approach from the stochastic processes literature to derive genome-wide significance levels that control the family-wise error rate (FWER). Whole genome simulations indicate that our method conservatively controls the FWER. Because positive selection can lead to false discoveries, we pair our IBD mapping approach with a selection scan so that one can contrast results for evidence of confounding due to recent sweeps or other mechanisms, like population structure, that increase IBD sharing. We developed automated and reproducible workflows to phase haplotypes, call local ancestry probabilities, and perform the IBD mapping scan, the former two tasks being important preprocessing steps for haplotype analyses. We applied our methods to search for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk loci in the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) genome data. We identified six genome-wide significant signals of AD risk among samples genetically similar to African and European reference populations and self-identified Amish samples. Variants in the six potential risk loci we detected have previously been associated with AD, dementia, and memory decline. Three genes at two potential risk loci have already been nominated as therapeutic targets. Overall, our scalable approach makes further use of large consortia resources, which are expensive to collect but provide insights into disease mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Here, we investigated the role of transcriptomic entropy in aging and cancer processes by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from thousands of human and mouse samples. We found that entropy changes during aging are highly tissue-specific, with some tissues showing increased entropy while others exhibit decreased or stable entropy levels. Transcriptomic entropy strongly correlates with age-related processes, showing positive associations with proliferation, cellular senescence, and somatic mutation burden, while negatively correlating with stemness. Surprisingly, cellular reprogramming also increases transcriptomic entropy. In cancer, we observed that primary tumors generally display higher entropy than normal tissue, with entropy levels further increasing in metastatic stages. Notably, treatment-resistant tumors showed distinct entropy patterns, with acquired resistance associated with increased entropy, while primary resistance and immediate post-treatment responses showed decreased entropy. Higher entropy levels predicted poor survival outcomes in multiple cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Furthermore, differential expression analysis revealed that entropy-associated genes are enriched in developmental processes and depleted in metabolic pathways, indicating a possible link to cellular dedifferentiation. Finally, we found increased entropy in various age-related diseases beyond cancer, suggesting that transcriptomic disorder may be a common feature in age-related pathologies. Our findings establish transcriptomic entropy as a fundamental parameter in aging and cancer progression, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and challenging the current view that increased disorder is always detrimental.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the comparative organization of mouse and human tumor microenvironments (mu/huTMEs). Through immunoprofiling of commonly used mouse models, we found that the immune composition of most muTMEs resemble poorly infiltrated human tumors extensively biased toward high macrophages densities. Relatedly, we discover species-specific biases of chemokine expression networks, factors which drive TMEs assembly. Further, assessing coarse cellular networks, we find conserved correlations between some immune cell frequencies, while other relationships only appear conserved in the huTMEs matching muTME profiles. Despite this variable alignment, we define robust cell type-specific gene expression programs conserved in TMEs across species and cohorts and identify ones that are coordinated between cell populations in both species. Together, we isolate and offer methods to study the multiple areas of hazard and opportunities for using mice to model human cancer.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, favorable conditions promote dispersal, while stressors like food scarcity or overcrowding trigger aggregation. Here, we describe a distinct behavior termed as swarming, where C. elegans move and feed in aggregates despite abundant food availability. While environmental factors have been implicated in this behavior, the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. We identify a novel role for the conserved calsyntenin protein CASY-1 in regulating swarming. Through genetic, behavioral, and optogenetic approaches, we show that CASY-1 functions in sensory neurons to modulate the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) signaling. Mutants in casy-1 show impaired PDF-1 signaling and reduced inhibition of the serotonin pathway, a known regulator of social behaviors. This dysregulation, along with its associated mechanosensory and foraging defects, likely contributes to the swarming phenotype. Our findings reveal a putative neuromodulatory pathway critical for swarming behavior in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Here, we demonstrate that human glutamine synthetase (GS) can reversibly polymerize into filaments aided by a composite binding site formed at the filament interface by the product, glutamine. Time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) confirms that glutamine binding stabilizes these filaments, which in turn exhibit reduced catalytic specificity for ammonia at physiological concentrations. This inhibition appears induced by a conformational change that remodulates the active site loop ensemble gating substrate entry. Metadynamics ensemble refinement revealed >10 [A] conformational range for the active site loop and that the loop is stabilized by transient contacts. This disorder is significant, as we show that the transient contacts which stabilize this loop in a closed conformation are essential for catalysis both in vitro and in cells. We propose that GS filament formation constitutes a negative-feedback mechanism, directly linking product concentration to the structural and functional remodeling of the enzyme.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Microtubule-binding components of the human outer kinetochore, such as Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are present in multiple copies and together bind several microtubule ends, creating a highly multivalent binding interface. Whereas Ndc80:Ndc80 and Ndc80:microtubule binding is crucial for interface stability, Ndc80 alone in absence of Ska is unable to support stable kinetochore-attachments. Using cryoET, we demonstrate that oligomeric Ndc80:Ska assemblies stabilise microtubule ends against shortening by strengthening lateral contacts between tubulin protofilaments at microtubule plus-ends. We further identify a point mutation within the SKA1 microtubule-binding domain that does not affect microtubule-binding of individual Ska molecules, but does abolish Ska:Ska interactions. Finally, we report that oligomerisation of Ska, in a cooperative fashion together with the Ndc80, is necessary to maintain stable microtubule attachments both in vivo and in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Among its antibacterial effectors, Tke5 has been identified as a potent pore-forming toxin that disrupts ion homeostasis without causing considerable membrane damage. Tke5 belongs to the BTH_I2691 protein family and harbours an N-terminal marker for the type six secretion system effectors (MIX) motif, previously shown to be required for T6SS-dependent secretion in other systems. Many MIX-containing effectors require T6SS adaptor proteins (Tap) for secretion, but until now, the molecular mechanism for adaptor-effector binding has remained elusive. Here, we report the 2.8 A cryo-EM structure of the Tap3-Tke5 complex, providing structural and functional insight into how this effector is recruited by its cognate adaptor protein Tap3. Functional dissection shows that the a-helical region of Tke5 is sufficient to kill intoxicated bacteria, while its b-rich region likely contributes to target membrane specificity.

The underlying immune mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we investigated whether respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection affects host vulnerability to subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection in two murine models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that prior RSV infection- induced heterologous protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection was dose and time dependent. RNA-seq and immunological analyses revealed that RSV triggered the activation of lung antigen presenting cells (APC)s and SARS-CoV-2 reactive mucosal T cells at day 9, which declined at 1 month. RSV also induced the expansion of lung {gamma}{delta} T cells and the upregulation of their cellular metabolic pathways. Furthermore, RSV infection in TCR{delta}-/- mice, which are deficient of {gamma}{delta} T cells, resulted in a reduced SARS-CoV-2 reactive mucosal T cell response and subsequent increased viral loads and higher levels of virus-induced inflammatory responses in the lung upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to the wild-type mice. In summary, our findings suggest that RSV infection provides heterologous protection against the subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection via induction of {gamma}{delta} T cell- mediated trained immunity in the lung and SARS-CoV-2 reactive mucosal T cell responses.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

To infect a bacterial host, a phage needs to bind to the bacterial surface via receptor binding proteins (RBPs), which are critical for determining host specificity. For functionally important receptors, the RBP-receptor interaction could be exploited via phage steering, where emerging bacterial resistance due to receptor modification could make bacteria less fit or virulent. Despite this, relatively little is known about RBP-receptor interactions. Here we build on the recent discovery of coliphages that have the outer membrane (OM) lipopolysaccharide translocon LptDE as their terminal receptor and show via cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) that, surprisingly, the RBP of the small siphophage Oekolampad binds to a hitherto unobserved, open state of LptDE. The open lateral gate of LptD is occupied by a b-strand peptide originating from the degraded N-terminal jellyroll domain of LptD, suggesting the possibility of LptD inhibition via peptidomimetics. A structure of LptDE in complex with the superinfection exclusion (SE) protein Rtp45 of the Oekolampad-related phage Rtp shows a mechanism of SE where Rtp45-induced conformational changes in LptD resulting from steric clashes preclude RBP binding. Finally, analysis of spontaneous Oekolampad-resistant E. coli mutants identifies mutations in LptD that abolish the LptDE-RBP interaction in vitro. SDS-EDTA sensitivity assays of the mutants show no major defects in LptDE function, suggesting that phage steering via LptDE might be challenging.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

As early-branching metazoans, cnidarians can offer insights into the early evolution of cell type-specific genome regulation. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in 60,000 cells from whole adults and gastrula-stage embryos of the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis.

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a ""promiscuous"" ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of S. aureus, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within S. aureus populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC. Our findings highlight an unexpected role for immune-deficient bacteria in facilitating the emergence of novel virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, emphasising their importance in shaping bacterial evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Despite an improved knowledge of the A. fumigatus genome, we still know little about the transcriptome, with key regulatory sequences like the untranslated regions of mRNA based only on in silico predictions and bulk-RNA-seq. Here, we provide an improved description of 5' and 3' untranslated regions of A. fumigatus poly(A)-enriched RNA through experimental mapping of transcription start sites and polyadenylation sites using 5' and 3' End-Seq. We assigned high-quality 5' ends to 2,747 genes (average length 126 nt), 3' ends to 7,079 genes (average length 268 nt), and improved our understanding of the regulatory landscape of A. fumigatus gene expression. We leveraged the refined 5' UTRs to identify upstream open reading frames and binding sites for important RNA binding proteins like the translational regulator Ssd1 and the 3' UTRs to define binding sites for PUF proteins known to contribute to mRNA localization and regulation. Although a single isoform typically dominated expression, we observed 148 instances of alternative start sites and 1,675 alternative stop sites. Interestingly, we detected multiple examples of premature transcriptional termination, including the first evidence for promoter-proximal premature transcriptional termination in a member of the Eurotiomycetes. Ultimately, we provide a resource to the Aspergillus community and an accurate starting point for unravelling the complexities of gene regulation in an important human pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

The structure of maltose-binding protein (43 kDa) was determined at 2.32 [A] resolution, clearly revealing the bound maltose and water molecules. Additionally, the kinase domain of human PLK1 (37 kDa), slightly below the theoretical limit, was determined at 3.04 [A] resolution, allowing the identification of the bound ligand, onvansertib.

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

While prior work has shown that tool use alters body representation, little is known about how artificial augmentations alter body representations as they are worn and used. Here, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, simply wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, following active use, both biological and artificial finger representations expanded significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a lasting aftereffect on biological finger representation was observed even after device removal. Our findings demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into the body representation, with dynamic adjustments in proprioceptive space shaped by both structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body- augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated into body representation. These results have direct implications for the design of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive technologies aimed at extending human physical capacity.

Significance statementHow do wearable augmentations reshape our sense of the body? Using a custom- built exoskeleton that extended the fingers, we tracked changes in body representation across four stages of wear and use. We found that the sensorimotor system rapidly integrates artificial extensions into its somatosensory map: first contracting, then expanding perceived finger length in response to structure and function, with the shifts persisting after device removal. Our findings reveal dynamic, use-dependent plasticity in body representation, which has direct relevance for designing prosthetics, exoskeletons, and assistive devices.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

DesignNationally-representative household survey, January-March 2025.

SettingGreat Britain.

Participants5,893 adults ([&ge;]18y).

Main outcome measuresParticipants were asked whether they had used medication in the past year to manage type 2 diabetes (excluding insulin), reduce the risk of heart disease, or support weight loss and, if so, whether they had used five specific GLP1-RAs. Those who had not used medication to support weight loss in the past year were asked how likely they would be to consider doing so in the next year. Estimates were reported stratified by participant characteristics and extrapolated to the national population.

ResultsOverall, 2.9% [2.4-3.4%] - [~]1.6 million adults - reported using a GLP-1RA to support weight loss in the past year, with 1.7% [1.4-2.1%] ([~]910,000 adults) using them exclusively for this purpose. The majority of those who used them exclusively for weight loss (91.4% [85.6-97.2%]) reported using GLP-1RAs that are licensed for this purpose in Great Britain, most commonly Mounjaro (tirzepatide; 80.2% [71.9-88.6%]). Of those who had not used weight-loss medication in the past year, 6.5% [5.7-7.3%] ([~]3.3 million adults) expressed an interest in doing so in the next year. Use and interest were more prevalent among women, people in mid-life, and those reporting past-month psychological distress. Interest was also higher among people facing greater socioeconomic disadvantage, including those in financial difficulty or unemployed due to long-term illness or disability.

ConclusionsIn the first quarter of 2025, 4.2 million adults in Great Britain - nearly one in ten - either had recently used a GLP-1RA to support weight loss or were interested in doing so in the near future. A substantial minority reported using a type of GLP-1RA that was not licensed for weight management, suggesting off-label use. Interest was particularly high among less advantaged socioeconomic groups, while use was similar across groups, highlighting the importance of addressing equity in access. These findings underscore the need to monitor who is accessing these medications and to ensure their safe, appropriate, and equitable provision.

However, their contents, functions, and evolutionary mechanisms remain unclear. We performed comparative genomics on long-read assembled GRCs from male House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Common Rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus), and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), the first two of which are newly presented and annotated here. These long-read GRCs are repeat-rich (63-74%), despite their wide variation in size (16-160 megabases), individually distinct gene content, and variable evolutionary histories. These GRCs have accumulated intact long terminal repeat (LTR) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and their proliferation co-occurs with speciation events of passerine birds. In contrast, normal chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes) are known to purge ERVs through ectopic recombination of LTRs that generate solo LTRs. Furthermore, transcriptomic data reveal significantly higher ERV transcription on GRCs than on A-chrs in House Finch testis. We propose that GRCs act as reservoirs of active ERVs, promoting germline transposition and potentially accelerating adaptation and speciation. This study suggests that GRCs play an indispensable role and likely contribute to adaptive diversification in birds.

They are used to treat metastatic HR+/HER2-breast cancer, but resistance is common, and this has been associated with TP53 loss and senescence evasion. We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition. This could help fuel the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-resistant clones, especially in p53-null cells that evade senescence to drive drug-resistance in patients.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

While many aspects of Patescibacteria remain enigmatic, an intriguing feature is the widespread occurrence of introns within their compact genomes. To better understand the diversity, roles, and evolution of bacterial introns, we focused on tRNA introns and analyzed Patescibacteria complete genome. Notably, 20% of these genomes lacked at least one tRNA gene for a canonical amino acid, primarily tRNAAsn and tRNAAsp, whereas other tRNA genes were readily detected. This observation led us to conduct further analyses, resulting in the discovery of a novel group I intron insertion site at position 35/36 within the anticodon loop that likely prevented detection by conventional annotation tools. Splicing assays demonstrated that these bacterial introns are catalytically active and capable of self-splicing. To assess the broader distribution of this insertion site across bacteria, we analyzed 4,934 bacterial genomes and identified 269 group I introns within tRNA genes across 14 phyla. Nearly 70% of introns at position 35/36 originate from Patescibacteria, indicating that this feature is largely confined to the phylum. Subgroup classification showed that 79% of all tRNA introns belonged to the IC subgroup, whereas almost all Patescibacteria introns were assigned to IA, suggesting a distinct evolutionary origin. As most tRNA introns lacked homing endonuclease genes, horizontal transfer appears limited. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of bacterial group I introns in tRNAs, with particular emphasis on Patescibacteria.

IMPORTANCEGroup I introns in bacterial tRNA genes were previously known only in a limited number of phyla. Our study expands this knowledge by identifying a novel insertion position in tRNA genes of phylum Patescibacteria and mapping their phylogenetic distribution across bacterial lineages. Our result revealed that group I introns inserted in tRNA genes differed in subgroups between Patescibacteria and other bacteria, highlighting the evolutionary uniqueness of introns of Patescibacteria. Additionally, we found that group I introns are maintained in 43% of bacterial phyla, with tRNA insertions being the most common. Our findings highlight that even in complete genomes, the presence of group I introns can hinder the detection of all 20 canonical tRNA genes by conventional tRNA annotation tools. This study illustrates the overlooked phylogenetic distribution of group I introns across the bacterial domain.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

Flowering shoot (inflorescence) architecture varies significantly across plant families and is a key target of genetic engineering efforts in many crops1-4. Asteraceae (sunflower family), comprising 10% of flowering plants, all have capitula, a novel inflorescence that mimics a single flower5,6. Asteraceae capitula are highly diverse but are thought to have evolved once via unknown mechanisms7,8. During capitulum development, shoot stem cells undergo prolonged proliferation to accommodate the formation of intersecting spirals of flowers (florets) along the disk-shaped head9,10. Here we show that capitulum evolution paralleled decreases in CLAVATA3 (CLV3) peptide signaling, a conserved repressor of stem cell proliferation. We trace this to novel amino acid changes in the mature CLV3 peptide which decrease receptor binding and downstream transcriptional outputs. Using genetically tractable Asteraceae models, we show that reversion of CLV3 to a more active form impairs Asteraceae stem cell regulation and capitulum development. Additionally, we trace the evolution of CLV3 and its receptors across the Asterales allowing inferences on capitulum evolution within this lineage. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms driving evolutionary innovation in plant reproduction and suggest new approaches for genetic engineering in crop species.","NA","biorxiv",1752012581091

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Yet, they take over a year to complete, are prone to human error, and face challenges with reproducibility; limiting access to timely and reliable information. We developed otto-SR, an end-to-end agentic workflow using large language models (LLMs) to support and automate the SR workflow from initial search to analysis. We found that otto-SR outperformed traditional dual human workflows in SR screening (otto-SR: 96.7% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity; human: 81.7% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity) and data extraction (otto-SR: 93.1% accuracy; human: 79.7% accuracy). Using otto-SR, we reproduced and updated an entire issue of Cochrane reviews (n=12) in two days, representing approximately 12 work-years of traditional systematic review work. Across Cochrane reviews, otto-SR incorrectly excluded a median of 0 studies (IQR 0 to 0.25), and found a median of 2.0 (IQR 1 to 6.5) eligible studies likely missed by the original authors. Meta-analyses revealed that otto-SR generated newly statistically significant findings in 2 reviews and negated significance in 1 review. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can rapidly conduct and update systematic reviews with superhuman performance, laying the foundation for automated, scalable, and reliable evidence synthesis.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1752012581091
