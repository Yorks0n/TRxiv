We present an accessible microfabrication workflow that addresses these challenges by integrating consumer 3D printing techniques and repurposing standard fluorescence microscopes equipped with DMDs for maskless photolithography. Our method achieves micrometer-scale precision across centimeter-sized areas without clean room infrastructure, using affordable and readily available consumables. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach through four biological applications: inducing cytoskeletal protrusions via 1 m-resolution surface topographies; micropatterning to standardize cell and tissue morphology; fabricating multilayer microfluidic devices for confined cell migration studies; imprinting agar chambers for long-time tracking of C. elegans. Our protocol drastically reduces material costs compared to conventional methods and enables design-to-device turnaround within a day. By leveraging open-source microscope control software and existing lab equipment, our workflow lowers the entry barrier to micro-fabrication, enabling labs to prototype custom solutions for diverse experimental needs while maintaining compatibility with soft lithography and downstream biological assays.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

To identify targetable determinants of peritoneal metastasis, we focused on appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AC), a gastrointestinal cancer that metastasizes almost exclusively to the peritoneum. Current treatments are extrapolated from colorectal cancer (CRC), yet AC has distinct genomic alterations, mucinous morphology and peritoneum restricted metastatic pattern. Further, no stable preclinical models of AC exist, limiting drug discovery and representing an unmet clinical need. We establish a first-in-class stable biobank of 16 long-term cultured AC patient-derived organoids (PDOs), including 3 matched, simultaneously resected primary AC-peritoneal carcinomatosis (AC-PC) pairs. By enriching for cancer cells, AC PDOs enable accurate genomic characterization relative to paucicellular AC tissue. We establish an organoid orthotopic intraperitoneal xenograft model that recapitulates diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis and show that PC-organoids retain increased metastatic capacity, decreased growth factor dependency and sensitivity to standard of care chemotherapy relative to matched primary AC organoids. Single cell profiling of AC-PC pairs reveals dedifferentiation from mucinous differentiated states in primary AC into intestinal stem cell and fetal progenitor states in AC-PC, with upregulation of oncogenic signaling pathways. Through hypothesis-driven drug testing, we identify KRASMULTI-ON inhibitor RMC-7977 and Wnt-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor WNTinib as novel, clinically actionable strategies to target AC-PC more effectively.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

While computed tomography (CT)-based screening has improved early detection and enabled curative surgeries, the molecular and cellular dynamics driving early-stage LUAD progression remain poorly understood, limiting non-surgical treatment options. To address this gap, we profiled 2.24 million cells from 122 early-stage LUAD patients using multiplexed imaging mass cytometry (IMC). This analysis revealed the molecular, spatial, and temporal dynamics of LUAD development. Our findings uncover a binary progression model. LUAD advances through either inflammation, driven by a balance of cytotoxic and regulatory immune activity, or fibrosis, characterized by stromal activation. Surprisingly, tumor cell populations did not increase significantly. Instead, they displayed a mixed phenotypic profile consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), effectively masking the expansion of malignant cells. Furthermore, we addressed discrepancies between CT-based and histology-based subtyping. CT scans, while non-invasive, often mischaracterize invasive fibrotic tumors that account for 20.5% of LUAD cases as mild, non-solid ground glass opacities (GGOs). Using high-content IMC imaging, we demonstrate that these tumors harbor significant risks and advocate for improved diagnostic strategies. These strategies should integrate molecular profiling to refine patient stratification and therapeutic decision making. Altogether, our study provides a high-resolution, systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment in early-stage LUAD. We characterize key transitions in oncogenesis and propose a precision-driven framework to enhance the detection and management of aggressive disease subtypes.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

While tools for sequencing, synthesis, and editing of genomic code have transformed biological research, intelligently composing new biological systems would also require a deep understanding of the immense complexity encoded by genomes. We introduce Evo 2, a biological foundation model trained on 9.3 trillion DNA base pairs from a highly curated genomic atlas spanning all domains of life. We train Evo 2 with 7B and 40B parameters to have an unprecedented 1 million token context window with single-nucleotide resolution. Evo 2 learns from DNA sequence alone to accurately predict the functional impacts of genetic variation--from noncoding pathogenic mutations to clinically significant BRCA1 variants--without task-specific finetuning. Applying mechanistic interpretability analyses, we reveal that Evo 2 autonomously learns a breadth of biological features, including exon-intron boundaries, transcription factor binding sites, protein structural elements, and prophage genomic regions. Beyond its predictive capabilities, Evo 2 generates mitochondrial, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic sequences at genome scale with greater naturalness and coherence than previous methods. Guiding Evo 2 via inference-time search enables controllable generation of epigenomic structure, for which we demonstrate the first inference-time scaling results in biology. We make Evo 2 fully open, including model parameters, training code, inference code, and the OpenGenome2 dataset, to accelerate the exploration and design of biological complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Here, we present structures of the midnolin-proteasome complex, revealing how established proteasomal components are repurposed to enable a unique form of proteolysis. While the proteasomal subunit PSMD2/Rpn1 binds to ubiquitinated or ubiquitin-like proteins, we discover that it also interacts with the midnolin nuclear localization sequence, elucidating how the activity of midnolin is confined to the nucleus. Likewise, PSMD14/Rpn11, an enzyme that normally cleaves ubiquitin chains, surprisingly functions non-enzymatically as a receptor for the midnolin ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, positioning the substrate-binding Catch domain directly above the proteasomal entry site to guide substrates into the proteasome.

Here, we describe Sequencing by Expansion (SBX), a single-molecule sequencing technology that overcomes these limitations by using a biochemical conversion process to encode the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule into an Xpandomer, a highly measurable surrogate polymer. Expanding over 50 times longer than the parent DNA templates, Xpandomers are engineered with high signal-to-noise reporter codes to enable facile, high-accuracy nanopore sequencing.

We introduce SAGE-net, a scalable framework and software package for training and evaluating S2F models using personal genomes. Leveraging its scalability, we conduct extensive experiments on model and training hyperparameters, demonstrating that training on personal genomes improves predictions for held-out individuals. However, the model achieves this by identifying predictive variants rather than learning a cis-regulatory grammar that generalizes across loci. This failure to generalize persists across a range of hyperparameter settings. These findings highlight the need for further exploration to unlock the full potential of S2F models in decoding the regulatory grammar of personal genomes.

Plasmids are extrachromosomal, self-replicating genetic elements that underlie much of the evolutionary flexibility of bacteria. Evolving plasmids face selective pressures on their hosts, but also compete within the cell for replication, making them an ideal system for studying the joint dynamics of multilevel selection. While theory indicates that within-cell selection should matter for plasmid evolution, experimental measurement of within-cell plasmid fitness and its consequences has remained elusive. Here we measure the within-cell fitness of competing plasmids and characterize drift and selective dynamics. We achieve this by the controlled splitting of synthetic plasmid dimers to create balanced competition experiments. We find that incompatible plasmids co-occur for longer than expected due to methylation-based plasmid eclipsing. During this period of co-occurrence, less transcriptionally active plasmids display a within-cell selective advantage over their competing plasmids, leading to preferential fixation of silent plasmids. When the transcribed gene is beneficial to the cell, for example an antibiotic resistance gene, there is a cell-plasmid fitness tradeoff mediated by the dominance of the beneficial trait. Surprisingly, more dominant plasmid-encoded traits are less likely to fix but more likely to initially invade than less dominant traits. Taken together, our results show that plasmid evolution is driven by dynamics at two levels, with a transient, but critical, contribution of within-cell fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

While existing models capture aspects like the number of loci, effect sizes, and allele frequencies, they often overlook the molecular processes underlying trait expression. We investigated how gene regulatory networks influence quantitative variation during adaptation by examining the negative autoregulation (NAR) motif in two configurations: K+, with four evolving network components, and K-, with two components. Using forward-time simulations, we tracked populations adapting to a shifted phenotypic optimum under varying genetic architectures. We found that K+ populations maintained rapid adaptation despite low recombination, preserving high genetic variance through positive epistasis and stronger linkage disequilibrium. Under low recombination, K+ populations reached the optimum through diverse molecular configurations, while responses were more uniform under high recombination. In contrast, K- and additive models showed impaired adaptation under low recombination. Our findings demonstrate that network structure fundamentally influences the distribution of variation within the molecular architecture of traits, with certain networks providing unexpected robustness against low recombination rates. This suggests that molecular complexity may confer evolutionary advantages in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Score Test (GST) in the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GST with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the GEEs with the robust Wald test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GST demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed that the GST-identified differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways directly implicated in cancer progression. In contrast, the Wilcoxon test-identified genes were enriched in non-cancer pathways and produced substantial false positives, highlighting its limitations for spatially structured data. Our findings suggest that the GST approach is well-suited for ST data, offering more accurate identification of biologically relevant gene expression changes. We have implemented the proposed method in R package ""SpatialGEE"", available on GitHub.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

A computational network model of the canonical microcircuit consisting of SOM, PV and excitatory neurons reproduced key experimental findings, including: stochastic gamma oscillations with drive-dependent frequency; precise phase-locking of PV interneurons and delayed firing of SOM interneurons; and the distinct effects of optogenetic perturbations of SOM and PV cells. In CAMINOS, the generation of network oscillations depends on both the precise spike timing of SOM and PV interneurons, with PV cells regulating oscillation frequency and network stability, and delayed SOM firing controlling the oscillation amplitude. The asymmetric PV-SOM connectivity is found to be the key source ingredient to generate these oscillations, that naturally establishes distinct PV and SOM-cell spike timing. The CAMINOS model predicts that increased SOM/PV densities along the cortical hierarchy leads to decreased oscillation frequencies (from gamma to alpha/beta) and increased seizure susceptibility, suggesting a unified circuit model for oscillations across different frequency bands.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Mossy fibers and unipolar brush cells emphasize eye position dynamics uniformly across the cardinal axes; Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons code eye velocity along directionally biased axes; Golgi cells show unmodulated firing. Differential directional response properties of different neuron types localize the directional input-output transformation to the last-order inputs to Purkinje cells.

Using genome-wide screening, we identified Ldm1 (Lipid Droplet Motility 1/Yer085c) as a myosin adaptor. Ldm1 binds to the globular tail domain of the myosin Myo2 and to the LD surface protein Ldo16 to enable actin-dependent LD motility.

Both plaques and tangles cause neuronal damage and stimulate inflammatory responses in glial cells. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-mediated signaling pathways support the function of damaged neurons and modulate inflammatory response. The FGFR1 agonists, including Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and FG loop peptide (FGL), have been implicated in multiple disease therapy. Whether FGFR1 agonists can improve pathology and cognitive function in AD remains unknown. Here, we showed that administration of FGF1 and FGL to the AD mouse model reversed spatial memory impairment, enhanced neurogenesis, suppressed reactive astrogliosis, and restricted dystrophic neurite. However, only FGF1 treatment reduced the deposition of senile plaque. In microglial culture studies, FGF1 improves the phagocytosis ability of microglia, which contributes to the clearance of plaques. Together, our findings suggested that FGFR1 agonists alleviate pathology and cognitive impairment via immunomodulatory and improve neuronal health in the AD mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Archaeobotanical remains provide critical insights into its cultivation history, but no comprehensive review or dedicated platform currently exists to synthesize and analyze these data. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive literature review and developed DateBack (https://cloudapps.france-bioinformatique.fr/dateback), a digital open access repository of archaeobotanical remains of Phoenix spp. In its first version, DateBack records macroremains (e.g., seeds, fruits, stems, petioles) from prehistoric to Late Antiquity contexts in Southwest and South Asia. We assembled 140 entries from 99 archaeological sites across 110 references, along with a separate table of 55 radiocarbon-dated entries from 17 sites, refining chronological assessments. Most entries comprise charred seeds (55.7%), with a smaller proportion of charred vegetative parts or desiccated remains. Our findings highlight regional disparities in remain distribution, concentrated in the Levant and Gulf, while Saudi Arabia and southern Iran are underrepresented, and in data reliability, particularly dating resolution, complicating the reconstruction of date cultivation history. Our evidence shows that the earliest securely dated remains, indicating date consumption, appear in the Gulf around 5000 BCE, while cultivation emerges later, first in southern Mesopotamia and the northern Gulf in the 4th millennium BCE, then in eastern Arabia and the Indus Valley in the 3rd millennium BCE. The Levant presents challenges, with numerous presumed early finds but significant uncertainties, with secure evidence of cultivation only appearing by the late 2nd millennium BCE, as in northwestern Arabia, while in the southern Arabian Peninsula, it is not attested until the 1st millennium BCE. By compiling and standardizing archaeobotanical data, DateBack facilitates advanced spatiotemporal analyses and supports additional archaeobotany-based research including ancient DNA studies. Moreover, the platform is dynamic, scalable, and collaborative, enhancing data integration and refinement, with future expansions planned to include additional periods (Islamic era and beyond), geographic regions (North Africa), and new types of evidence, such as plant microremains and iconography.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Although they are routinely used for studying evolutionary histories and assessing new assemblies, current methods do not incorporate information from available genomic data. Here, we first determine the influence of evolutionary history on universal gene content in plants, fungi and animals. We find that across 11,098 genomes comprising 2,606 taxonomic groups, 215 groups significantly vary from their respective lineages in terms of their BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single Copy Orthologs) completeness. Additionally, 169 groups display an elevated complement of duplicated orthologs, likely as an artifact of whole genome duplication events. Secondly, we investigate the extent of taxonomic congruence in BUSCO-derived whole-genome phylogenies. For 275 suitable families out of 543 tested, sites evolving at higher rates produce at most 23.84% more taxonomically concordant, and at least 46.15% less terminally variable phylogenies compared to lower-rate sites. We find topological differences between BUSCO concatenated and coalescent trees to be marginal and conclude that higher rate sites from concatenated alignments produce the most congruent and least variable phylogenies. Finally, we show that BUSCO misannotations can lead to misrepresentations of assembly quality. To overcome this issue, we filter a Curated set of BUSCOs (CUSCOs) that provide up to 6.99% fewer false positives compared to the standard BUSCO search and introduce novel methods for comparing assemblies using BUSCO synteny. Overall, we highlight the importance of considering evolutionary histories during assembly evaluations and release the phyca software toolkit that reconstructs consistent phylogenies and reports phylogenetically informed assembly assessments.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

In this task, the decision-maker can choose between two options, one that will only provide rewards to itself (selfish choice) or one that will reward both itself and its cagemate (prosocial choice). Our work reveals that prosocial choices in male mice are not widespread and are only observed in a small proportion of animals. Using detailed analysis of behavior, we describe that recipients of help express different social cues in prosocial and selfish trials, but decision makers do not take them into account to guide their choices. Furthermore, we assess how the level of individual training and the physical layout of the paradigm might affect the performance in this social task.

A commonality of these approaches is the need to establish the anatomical locations of both experimental parameters (e.g. recording/injection sites) and circuit components (e.g. cell bodies/projections). The development of standardized coordinate systems, i.e. reference brain atlases, has proven essential for reproducible, cross-laboratory mapping of anatomical data. However, the process of mapping, analyzing, and visualizing anatomical data remains challenging, especially for users lacking programming expertise. Here, we introduce DMC-BrainMap, an open-source napari plugin designed as a user-friendly tool for streamlined processing and whole-brain analysis of anatomical data. The working principle and core functionalities include all steps after image acquisition, i.e., preprocessing of images, registration of images to a reference atlas, segmentation of different anatomical features, and data analysis/visualization. DMC-BrainMap can be applied to histological data obtained from a variety of model organisms at different developmental stages, including mouse, rat, and zebrafish.

However, challenges persist in capturing sidechain packing, condition-dependent conformational dynamics, and biomolecular interactions, primarily due to scarcity of high-quality training data. Emerging techniques, including cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and high-throughput crystallography, promise vast new sources of structural data, but translating raw experimental observations into mechanistically interpretable atomic models remains a key bottleneck. Here, we aim to address these challenges by improving the efficiency of structural analysis through combining experimental measurements with a landmark protein structure prediction method -- AlphaFold2. We present an augmentation of AlphaFold2, ROCKET, that refines its predictions using cryo-EM, cryo-ET, and X-ray crystallography data, and demonstrate that this approach captures biologically important structural variation that AlphaFold2 does not. By performing structure optimization in the space of coevolutionary embeddings, rather than Cartesian coordinates, ROCKET automates difficult modeling tasks, such as flips of functional loops and domain rearrangements, that are beyond the scope of current state-ofthe-art methods and, in some instances, even manual human modeling. The ability to efficiently sample these barrier-crossing rearrangements unlocks a new horizon for scalable and automated model building. Crucially, ROCKET does not require retraining of AlphaFold2 and is readily adaptable to multimers, ligand-cofolding, and other data modalities. Conversely, our differentiable crystallographic and cryo-EM target functions are capable of augmenting other structure prediction methods. ROCKET thus provides an extensible framework for the integration of experimental observables with biomolecular machine learning.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a distance measure that has been applied to species delineation, building of guide trees, and searching large sequence databases. Since computing ANI is computationally expensive, the field has increasingly turned to sketch-based approaches that use assumptions and heuristics to speed this up. We propose a suite of simulated and real benchmark datasets, together with a rank-correlation-based metric, to study how these assumptions and heuristics impact distance estimates. We call this evaluation framework EvANI. With EvANI, we show that ANIb is the ANI estimation algorithm that best captures tree distance, though it is also the least efficient. We show that k-mer based approaches are extremely efficient and have consistently strong accuracy. We also show that some clades have inter-sequence distances that are best computed using multiple values of k, e.g. k=10 and k=19 for Chlamydiales. Finally, we highlight that approaches based on maximal exact matches may represent an advantageous compromise, achieving an intermediate level of computational efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on a single fixed k-mer length.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

We conducted an integrated analysis that combines electrophysiological and transcriptomic profiling, along with machine learning, of islet cells from T1D donors to investigate the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. Surviving {beta}-cells exhibit altered electrophysiological properties and transcriptomic signatures indicative of increased antigen presentation, metabolic reprogramming, and impaired protein translation. In -cells, we observed hyper-responsiveness and increased exocytosis, which are associated with upregulated immune signaling, disrupted transcription factor localization and lysosome homeostasis, as well as dysregulation of mTORC1 complex signaling. Notably, key genetic risk signals for T1D were enriched in transcripts related to -cell dysfunction, including MHC class I which were closely linked with -cell dysfunction. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of islet cell dysfunction in T1D, highlighting pathways that may be leveraged to preserve residual {beta}-cell function and modulate -cell activity. These findings underscore the complex interplay between immune signaling, metabolic stress, and cellular identity in shaping islet cell phenotypes in T1D.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Through physicochemical, mineralogical, spectroscopic, electron microscopy, and metagenomic analyses, we identified diverse microbial communities with metabolic capacities that induce mineralisation. Seasonal environmental fluctuations drive cyclical changes in community composition, producing potential mineralisation patterns. Our findings suggest that carbon fixation and the metabolic drivers of alkalinity in microbialites evolved over time.

Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we hypothesized that the brain employs vectorial coding principles, such that meaning is reflected in distributed activity of single neurons. We recorded responses of hundreds of neurons in the human hippocampus, which has a well-established role in semantic coding, while participants listened to narrative speech. We find encoding of contextual word meaning in the simultaneous activity of neurons whose individual selectivities span multiple unrelated semantic categories. Like embedding vectors in semantic models, distance between neural population responses correlates with semantic distance; however, this effect was only observed in contextual embedding models (like BERT) and was reversed in non-contextual embedding models (like Word2Vec), suggesting that the semantic distance effect depends critically on contextualization. Moreover, for the subset of highly semantically similar words, even contextual embedders showed an inverse correlation between semantic and neural distances; we attribute this pattern to the noise-mitigating benefits of contrastive coding. Finally, in further support for the critical role of context, we find that range of neural responses covaries with lexical polysemy. Ultimately, these results support the hypothesis that semantic coding in the hippocampus follows vectorial principles.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Myeloid cells play a critical role in shaping the inflammatory environment and influencing disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway reprograms myeloid cells into an immunoregulatory phenotype, leading to reduced neuroinflammation and disease severity. Using both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human-derived myeloid cells, we show that Wnt agonist treatment promotes the expression of inhibitory molecules such as PD-L1 and PD-L2, suppressing pro-inflammatory responses. In the chronic and relapsing-remitting EAE models, Wnt activation significantly reduced disease severity, immune cell infiltration into the CNS, and pathogenic T cell responses. Notably, in relapsing-remitting EAE, Wnt treatment prevented new relapses in a PD-L1-dependent manner, highlighting the crucial role of myeloid cell-mediated immune regulation.

These macrophages are derived from monocytes that are recruited from the circulation into the developing lesion, where they proliferate and differentiate into macrophages, with proliferation producing most of the macrophages in the resulting lesions. However, the signals and transcriptional events driving the proliferation of atherosclerotic plaque macrophages remain poorly understood. Analysis of human plaque spanning a range of disease severity identified a subpopulation of macrophages that expressed the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA2. These GATA2-expressing macrophages had a transcriptional profile that was intermediary between monocytes and mature macrophages, and selectively upregulated genes associated with proliferation and apoptosis. The expression of GATA2 was concomitant with plaque macrophage proliferation at all stages of disease, with over 90% of proliferating macrophages expressing GATA2. GATA2 was upregulated in macrophages following exposure to oxLDL, with GATA2 expression being necessary and sufficient for the proliferation of these macrophages. In these cells, GATA2 mediates proliferation by upregulating expression of the proto-oncogene MYB, while simultaneously decreasing sensitivity to apoptosis induced by the unfolded protein response. Together, these data identify GATA2 as a transcription factor upregulated by atherogenic stimuli that functions as the primary mediator of macrophage proliferation in atherosclerotic plaque.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

We have determined the secondary structure of this large RNA, TER1, based on phylogenetics and bioinformatic modeling, as well as genetic and biochemical analyses. We find that several conserved regions of the rapidly evolving TER1 RNA are important for the ability of telomerase to maintain telomeres, based on testing truncation mutants in vivo, whereas, overall, many other large regions are dispensable. This is similar to budding yeast telomerase RNA, TLC1, and consistent with functioning as a flexible scaffold for the RNP. We tested if the essential three-way junction works from other locations in TER1, finding that indeed it can, supporting that it is flexibly scaffolded. Furthermore, we find that a half-sized Mini-TER1 allele, built from the catalytic core and the three-way junction, reconstitutes catalytic activity with TERT in vitro.

We investigated the impact of interferon alpha (IFN-), a cytokine produced during the immune response to viral infection or the presence of un-edited endogenous double-stranded RNAs, on human {beta}-cell physiology. Intravital microscopy on transplanted human islets using a {beta}-cell-selective reactive oxygen species (ROS) biosensor (RIP1-GRX1-roGFP2), revealed a subset of human {beta}-cells that acutely produce ROS in response to IFN-. Comparison to Integrated Islet Distribution Program (IIDP) phenotypic data revealed that healthier donors had more ROS accumulating cells. In vitro IFN- treatment of human islets similarly elicited a heterogenous increase in superoxide production that originated in the mitochondria. To determine the unique molecular signature predisposing cells to IFN- stimulated ROS production, we flow sorted human islets treated with IFN-. RNA sequencing identified genes involved in inflammatory and immune response in the ROS-producing cells. Comparison with single cell RNA-Seq datasets available through the Human Pancreas Analysis Program (HPAP) showed that genes upregulated in ROS-producing cells are enriched in control {beta}-cells rather than T1D donors. Combined, these data suggest that IFN- stimulates mitochondrial ROS production in healthy human {beta}-cells, potentially predicting a more efficient antiviral response.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Unmodified RNAs stimulate human innate immunity, but RNA modifications suppress this response. mRNA m6A modification is essential for Arabidopsis thaliana viability. However, the molecular basis of the impact of mRNA m6A depletion is poorly understood. Here, we show that disruption of the Arabidopsis mRNA m6A writer complex triggers autoimmunity. Most gene expression changes in m6A writer complex vir-1 mutants grown at 17{degrees}C are explained by defence gene activation and are suppressed at 27{degrees}C, consistent with the established temperature sensitivity of Arabidopsis immunity. Accordingly, we found enhanced pathogen resistance and increased premature cell death in vir-1 mutants at 17{degrees}C but not 27{degrees}C. Global temperature-sensitive mRNA poly(A) tail length changes accompany these phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that autoimmunity is a major phenotype of mRNA m6A writer complex mutants, which has important implications for interpreting this modification's role. Furthermore, we open the broader question of whether unmodified RNA triggers immune signalling in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

The conserved regulator DnaA, the initiator of chromosome replication, is associated to size regulation by controlling the number of origins of replication (oriC) per cell. In this study, we identify and characterize a new mechanism in which DnaA modulates cell size independently of oriC-copy number. By altering the levels of DnaA without impacting chromosome replication, we demonstrate that DnaA's activity as a transcription factor can slow down cell elongation rate resulting in cells that are ~20% smaller. We identify the peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzyme MurD as a key player of cell size regulation in Caulobacter crescentus and in the evolutionarily distant bacterium Escherichia coli.

Traditionally, structure-based virtual screening required experimental protein structures, but advances like AlphaFold2 have begun to overcome this limitation. However, AlphaFold2 does not capture ligand-induced conformational changes (transition from apo to holo forms), limiting its utility for protein-ligand docking. In this study, we evaluate AlphaFold3, which predicts protein-ligand complex structures when both protein and ligand inputs are provided. Using the DUD-E dataset and Uni-Dock, we show that holo structures predicted with ligand inclusion yield higher screening performance than apo structures generated without ligand input. Notably, incorporating active ligands enhances screening performance, whereas inactive (decoy) ligands produce results similar to apo predictions. The use of template structures further improves outcomes. We also analyze the impact of ligand molecular weight, binding pocket location, and AlphaFold3 ranking scores on screening performance. Our findings indicate that lower molecular weight ligands tend to generate predicted structures that more closely resemble experimental holo structures, thus improving screening efficacy. Conversely, larger ligands (700-800) can induce open binding pockets that favor screening for some targets. These results suggest that employing AlphaFold3 with appropriate ligand inputs is a promising strategy for virtual screening, particularly for proteins lacking experimental structural data.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

While effective in alleviating immune-mediated conditions, JAK inhibitors can impair antiviral defences by suppressing interferon (IFN) responses, potentially increasing susceptibility to viral infections. This study investigates the pro-viral mechanism of JAK inhibitors, focusing on baricitinib, across various cell lines, retinal organoids, and viral strains, including a recombinant IFN-sensitive Rift Valley fever (rRVFV), influenza A (rIAV), SARS-CoV-2 (rSARSCoV-2) reporter viruses, and wild type adenovirus (AdV). Our findings demonstrate that baricitinib suppresses transcription of IFN-stimulated genes in non-infected cells (ISGs) which is triggered by type I IFNs produced by infected cells, facilitating viral propagation. The pro-viral effects were influenced by viral load, inhibitor concentration, and structural characteristics of the compound. These results underscore the dual effects of JAK inhibitors: reducing inflammation while potentially exacerbating viral infections. Additionally, the findings highlight opportunities to leverage JAK inhibitors for viral research, vaccine production, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Building on our knowledge of molecular mechanisms driving PPGL progression, we assessed the therapeutic potential of targeting two critical processes: PI3K signaling and cell cycle regulation. The efficacy of buparlisib (PI3Ki) and ribociclib (CDK4/6i), individually and combined, was assessed in vitro using PPGL cell lines, rat- and patient-derived primary cells, and in vivo using PPGL cells-derived mouse xenografts. The combination therapy demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared to single agents, particularly in vivo. Mechanistically, the efficacy of the combination therapy was associated to the downregulation of FOXM1-controlled genes implicated in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosomal segregation, leading to mitotic catastrophe. Data mining and qRT-PCR showed this genetic signature to be upregulated in human mPPGLs. This suggests that aggressive PPGLs exhibit heightened vulnerability to dual PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibition, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for these challenging cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Fourteen out of the sixteen mAbs neutralized the virus in vitro. The mAbs with the strongest hemagglutination inhibition activity also demonstrated greater neutralizing capacity and showed increased protective effects in vivo when administered prophylactically or therapeutically in a murine H5N1 challenge model.

Biochemically, ABHD12 functions as a lipase, and catalyzes the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) (lyso-PS lipase). By doing so, it controls the concentrations and signaling pathways regulated by this potent signaling lysophospholipid in the mammalian brain. While genetic mapping efforts have identified over 30 mutations in ABHD12 from human PHARC subjects, the biochemical activity of these pathogenic mutants remains unknown. To understand this, here, we performed an exhaustive bioinformatics survey, and collated ABHD12 protein sequences from various organisms across evolution. Next, based on sequence alignments and structural modeling, we identified functionally relevant conserved residues in the ABHD12 protein sequence that are potentially important for its enzymatic activity. To validate these in silico findings, we generated numerous mutants of murine ABHD12, including those associated with human PHARC subjects, and assayed them for their enzymatic activity. Taken together, these complementary in silico and biochemical studies provide the first thorough sequence-function relationship for mammalian ABHD12, especially relevant in the context of PHARC. Finally, our evolutionary analysis identified CG15111 as an ABHD12 ortholog in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), and enzymatic assays indeed confirmed that recombinant CG15111 has robust lyso-PS lipase activity. Flies serve as an excellent animal system to model various human neurological diseases, and the identification of CG15111 as a Drosophila melanogaster ABHD12 ortholog opens new avenues to study PHARC in fly models.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Here we solve this problem by introducing BADDADAN, which uses machine learning to identify gene modules - groups of co-expressed and/or co-regulated genes - and constructs an ODE model that predicts gene module dynamics under stress. By integrating time-series gene expression data with prior co-expression data it finds modules that are both coherent and interpretable.

These methods differ in their approaches to learn the contig embeddings and to cluster them. Rapid advances in binning require rigorous benchmarking to evaluate the effectiveness of new methods. We have benchmarked newly developed state-of-the-art deep learning binners on CAMI2 datasets, including our own, McDevol. Results: The results show that COMEBin and GenomeFace give the best binning accuracy, although not always the best embedding accuracy. Interestingly, post-binning reassembly consistently improves the quality of low coverage bins. We find that binning coassembled contigs with multi-sample coverage is effective for low coverage dataset while binning multi-sample contigs with multi-sample coverage (multi-sample) is effective for high-coverage samples. In multi-sample binning, splitting the embedding space by sample before clustering showed enhanced performance compared to the standard approach of splitting final clusters by sample. Conclusions: COMEBin and GenomeFace emerged as the top-performing tools overall, with MetaBAT2 and GenomeFace demonstrating superior speed.

However, it has largely been developed using data from individuals of White ethnicity.

MethodsWe utilised data from multiple sources to derive estimates for the distributions of risk factors and their effect sizes in major UK ethnic groups (White, Black, South Asian, East Asian, and Mixed). We combined these with ethnicity-specific population cancer incidences to update BOADICEA so that it provides ethnicity-specific risk estimates. We also developed and included a method for deriving adjusted polygenic scores for individuals of mixed genetic ancestry.

ResultsThe predicted average absolute risks were smaller in all non-White ethnic groups than in Whites, and the risk distributions were narrower. The proportion of women classified as at moderate or high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, according to national guidelines, was considerably smaller in non-White women.

DiscussionThe updated BOADICEA (v7), available in the CanRisk tool (www.canrisk.org), is based on estimates more appropriate for non-White women in the UK. Further validation of the model in prospective studies is required. Considering these findings, risk classification guidelines for non- White women may need to be revised.","NA","medrxiv",1740434924670

However, BI-RADS requires manual reading, which is impractical on a large scale and may cause information loss.

MethodsWe extended BOADICEA to incorporate continuous MD measurements, calculated using the automated Volpara and STRATUS software. We used data from the KARMA cohort (60,276 participants; 1,167 incident BC). Associations between MD measurements and BC risk were estimated in a randomly selected training subset (two-thirds of the dataset). Percent MD residuals were calculated after regressing on age at mammography and BMI. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for family history and BOADICEA risk factors, and were incorporated into BOADICEA. The remaining one-third of the cohort was used to assess the performance of the extended BOADICEA (v 7.2) in predicting 5-year risks.

ResultsThe BC HRs per SD of residual STRATUS density were estimated to be 1.48 (95%CI: 1.33-1.64) and 1.41 (95%CI: 1.27-1.56) for pre- and post-menopausal women, respectively. The corresponding estimates for Volpara density were 1.27 (95%CI: 1.15-1.40) and 1.38 (95%CI: 1.25-1.54). The extended BOADICEA showed improved discrimination in the testing dataset over using BIRADS, with a 1-4% increase in AUC across different combinations of risk factors. Based on 5-year BC risk with MD as the sole input, approximately 11% of the women were reclassified into lower risk categories and 18% into higher risk categories using the extended model.

ConclusionIncorporating continuous MD measurements into BOADICEA enhances breast cancer risk stratification and facilitates the use of automated MD measures for risk prediction.","NA","medrxiv",1740434924670

Here, we discovered that several different REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM (REM) transcription factors are required for methylation at CLSY3 targets specific to male or female reproductive tissues. We designate these factors as REM INSTRUCT METHYLATION (RIMs) and demonstrate that disruption of their DNA binding domains, or the motifs they recognize, blocks RdDM.

This novel mode of targeting expands our understanding of how methylation is regulated to include inputs from both genetic and epigenetic information.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

In the kidney, a recent report demonstrated that resident macrophages in the medulla were responsibe for removing sedimentary particles from urine to prevent tubule obstruction. In this study, we found that resident macrophages in the kidney cortex distinguishably highly expressed phosphate transporter SLC34A1 relative to other tissue macrophages including their counterparts in kidney medulla. The cortex juxtatubular macrophages formed transepithelial protrusions and could reabsorb phosphate from the urine via SLC34A1. As such, depleting Slc34a1 from kidney macrophages increased phosphate urine output. Moreover, loss of SLC34A1 expression from kidney macrophages led to a rampant formation of intratubular calcium phosphate (CaP) microcrystals, which when in a challenge of oxalate over-exposure, accelerated the formation of kidney mineral stones. Physiologically, cortex macrophages would upregulate SLC34A1 expression in response to the overpresence of environmental CaP crystals, which could enhance phosphate reabsorption as a preventing strategy to preclude mineral stone formation in the downstream renal tubule system.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

AOX oxidizes coenzyme Q and reduces O2 in H2O, partially replacing the ETS cytochrome c segment and alleviating the oxidative stress caused by ETS overload. As successfully demonstrated in animal models, AOX shows potential in mitigating mitochondrial diseases. However, its non-proton-pumping nature may uncouple mitochondria, leading to excessive heat generation and interference with normal metabolism and physiology. Here we show that AOX from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis accelerates development ofDrosophila melanogaster, elevating larval biomass accumulation (primarily due to increased fat), mobility and food intake, without increasing body heat production. AOX intensifies Leak respiration and lowers oxidative phosphorylation efficiency through functional interactions with the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH). This is associated with increased complex I (CI)-driven respiration and supercomplex formation, higher cellular NAD+/NADH ratios, and an enhanced flux through the central carbon metabolism. Chemical uncouplers and rotenone confirm the roles of mitochondrial uncoupling and CI in the development of AOX-expressing larvae. Thus, AOX appears to be promoting increased growth by reinforcing the larval proliferative metabolic program via an intricate mechanism that reconfigures the larval ETS.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

There is a general consensus that simple models of quantitative genetic variation, which are mostly founded on the assumption of mutation-selection balance in a constant environment, have failed to explain high heritability. To make matters worse, the reasons for failure are unknown, leaving little to guide future model developments. Here we revisit this puzzle by taking the canonical Latter-Bulmer model and relaxing the assumption of perfect environmental stasis. Instead we assume that the trait optimum changes slowly but steadily in a random walk (specifically, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), similar to standard models used for phylogenetic comparative methods. We show that our model behaves qualitatively differently to its stationary optimum counterpart even though the optimum only changes slowly. This is the result of a feedback between the adaptation rate and selection coefficient fluctuations. The heritability predictions resulting from this feedback are more consistent with observations and also less sensitive to evolutionary parameters than the classical LB model. We derive a simple formula to predict genetic variation under random walk optimum fluctuations which helps to explain some of our counter-intuitive results and which should be useful for understanding the potential influence of fluctuations in future work. Since the feedback driving our results should also occur in more complex models e.g. with multiple traits, we argue that environmental change has been an essential biological ingredient missing in previous mutation-selection balance models of quantitative trait heritability.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Computational chemistry and machine learning methods have been developed to investigate these tasks. Despite the encouraging performance, virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization are often studied separately by existing methods, partially because they are performed sequentially in the existing drug discovery pipeline, thereby overlooking their interdependency and complementarity. To address this problem, we propose LigUnity, a foundation model for protein-ligand binding prediction by jointly optimizing virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization. In particular, LigUnity learns coarse-grained active/inactive distinction for virtual screening, and fine-grained pocket-specific ligand preference for hit-to-lead optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of LigUnity on eight benchmarks across both tasks. In virtual screening, LigUnity outperforms 24 competing methods with more than 50% improvement on the DUD-E and Dekois 2.0 benchmarks, and shows robust generalization to novel proteins. In hit-to-lead optimization, LigUnity achieves the best performance on split-by-time, split-by-scaffold, and split-by-unit settings, further demonstrating its potential as a cost-effective alternative to free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations. We further showcase how LigUnity can be employed in an active learning framework to efficiently identify active ligands for TYK2, a therapeutic target for autoimmune diseases, yielding over 40% improved prediction performance. Collectively, these comprehensive results establish LigUnity as a versatile foundation model for both virtual screening and hit-to-lead optimization, offering broad applicability across the drug discovery pipeline through accurate protein-ligand affinity predictions.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Insertion sequences, the simplest MGEs usually encoding only the necessary genes for transposition and maintenance, are widespread in bacterial genomes, and are particularly common in plasmids. Plasmids, self-replicating extrachromosomal DNA elements, often exist in multiple copies imparting a stochastic barrier to the fixation of an insertion sequence by limiting the proportion of the plasmid population harboring the IS. In this work we demonstrate that to overcome this, the IS200/605 family of insertion sequences utilizes programmable RNA guided nucleases as gene drive to spread the IS through the plasmid population. TnpB, the likely ancestor of Cas12, records the specific insertion site of the IS in its RNA guide to prevent loss of the IS during transposition. When introduced to a plasmid TnpB will be reprogrammed to target and cleave IS- plasmids, resulting in biased replication of only those IS+ plasmids. Furthermore, the gene drive activity is critical for the IS to invade high copy plasmid populations. Because TnpB can only be mobilized between microbes on other mobile genetic elements, this advantage to fixing in plasmids may help explain the prevalence of TnpB across the tree of life. More generally, the unique pressures arising from movement between genetic contexts with different multiplicities shapes the evolution of strategies for MGE spread.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Predicting patterns of diversity under such background selection has received considerable attention, and recent applications were able to explain a large portion of the variation in diversity across the human genome. However, current models have yielded conflicting results, stemming from two key limitations. First, they display inaccuracies in the most critical region of parameter space (Nes [~] -1), where the reduction in diversity is sharpest; second, they assume a constant population size over time. Here, we develop predictions for diversity under background selection based on the Hill-Robertson system of two-locus statistics allowing for population size changes. We treat the joint effect of multiple selected loci independently, but we show that interference among them is well captured through local rescaling of mutation, recombination and selection in an iterative procedure that converges quickly. We further accommodate existing background selection theory to population size changes, bridging the gap between weak and strong selection. Simulations show that our predictions are accurate over the entire distribution of selection coefficients. We characterize the temporal dynamics of linked selection under non-equilibrium demography and demonstrate that patterns of diversity can be misinterpreted by other models. Specifically, neglecting population size changes bias predictions of diversity, which then carry over to downstream inferences of the distribution of fitness effects and deleterious mutation rate. Jointly modeling demography and linked selection therefore improves our understanding of the genomic landscape of diversity, which will help refine inferences of linked selection in humans and other species.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

Here we attempt a mesoscopic investigation, using reaction-diffusion modelling in a simple biophysical picture of the cell to attempt to ask, generally, which conditions cause substantial ATP gradients to emerge within eukaryotic cells. If ATP sources (like mitochondria) or sinks (like the nucleus) are spatially clustered, large fold changes in concentration can exist across the cell; if sources and sinks are more spread then rapid diffusion indeed prevents large gradients being established. This dependence holds in model cells of different sizes, suggesting its generality across cell types.

We modeled two populations exchanging migrants using Fisher Geometric Model for local adaptation, phenotype matching for mate choice, and multiple pairs of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMI). All three mechanisms were determined by the same set of loci, creating conditions for interactions between barriers both at the genetic and population levels. We found no cases where the three barriers evolved. Instead, two barriers could evolve depending on the migration rate: either local adaptation and genetic incompatibilities for limited migration, or local adaptation and mate choice for higher migration. Our results showed that local adaptation due to ecological differentiation was the first to evolve and by far the most effective reproductive barrier. Finally, we demonstrated that in a polygenic model, populations could become locally adapted and evolve strict mate choice, yet they would not accumulate incompatibilities provided that there was sufficient gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670

While the general reaction catalyzed by recombinases is the same in all domains, key differences at the amino acid level can lead to the specialization of this family of proteins. A key example of this is in the domain of Eukarya, which can utilize two different RecA homologs depending on the life cycle stage of the organism, with the activity of Rad51 utilized during mitotic growth and the activity of Dmc1 used during meiosis. Why most eukaryotes utilize two RecA homologs is an open question. A missing piece of information in this story is the identity of RecA homologs before the divergence of Rad51 and Dmc1, which occurred in early eukaryotes. We analyzed sequence data from the Archaeal homolog, RadA, in the Asgard Archaea superphyla. Our findings include evidence for the evolution of a eukaryotic-specific DNA binding site II within the Asgard lineage. We also identify sequence variants within DNA binding loops L1 and L2, part of binding site I, that imply higher mismatch tolerance within the Asgard and DPANN superphylum. These loops are also observed in the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 within Eukarya. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests the last Archaeal ancestor of Rad51 and Dmc1 was more Dmc1-like in character and likely of lower fidelity.","NA","biorxiv",1740434924670
