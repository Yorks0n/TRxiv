Here, we introduce peptide-RNA crosslink isolation for sequencing by mass spectrometry or pepR-MS, a method that enriches peptide-RNA crosslinks with RNA chains of tunable length. Applied to breast cancer cells, pepR-MS identifies over 21,000 unique crosslinks at 4,757 crosslinking sites in 744 proteins. Employing different nucleases, we capture crosslinks with RNA moieties up to six nucleotides, revealing RNA crosslinking preferences at domain and subdomain resolution. Finally, we demonstrate mass spectrometry-based sequential sequencing of both peptide and RNA from the same crosslink, providing a starting point for the analysis of long-chain peptide-RNA crosslinks that map interaction interfaces across the proteome and transcriptome.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""325871075;492625837;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340829

We find reconstituted myeloid cells adopt region-specific transcriptional, morphological and tiling profiles characteristic of resident microglia. Young donor cells in aged brains rapidly acquired aging phenotypes, particularly in the cerebellum, while old cells in young brains adopted youthful profiles. We identified STAT1-mediated signaling as one axis controlling microglia aging, as STAT1-loss prevented aging trajectories in reconstituted cells. Spatial transcriptomics combined with cell ablation models identified rare natural killer cells as necessary drivers of interferon signaling in aged microglia.

Somitogenesis, the rhythmic segmentation of vertebrate embryos, is governed by signalling gradients and oscillations in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)1,2, but the corresponding protein dynamics are largely unknown. Perturbations in this process cause congenital spine disorders and can result in embryonic lethality3. Here, we introduce an integrated proteomics and microfluidics approach to resolve spatiotemporal protein expression in the developing mouse tail. To this end, we established a microfluidic system to synchronize oscillations in embryo tails grown in 3D, which we combined with mass-spectrometry and RNA sequencing. We uncover novel oscillatory proteins and differentially expressed genes along the anteroposterior axis. Building on this dataset, we identify a previously unrecognized antagonistic, dynamic ligand-receptor expression pattern in R-Spondin/LGR signalling explaining how Wnt-oscillation amplitude increases despite decreasing ligand levels in anterior PSM. Dynamic ligand expression was validated in mouse gastruloids. Perturbation of ligand dynamics reduced oscillation amplitude and impaired somite formation. Our study reveals a novel regulatory strategy in which dynamic antagonistic gradients fine-tune signalling strength, providing new mechanistic insight into how protein dynamics control tissue patterning. We anticipate our dataset to serve as foundation for mechanistic investigations of mammalian somitogenesis including the role of mechanics and metabolism. More broadly, our approach combining microfluidics-based synchronization of signalling in multicellular systems with omics analyses can be applied to study dynamics in other contexts such as in tissue homeostasis4 and regeneration5.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMR's underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon's therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPH's core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

As such, taxonomic identification often becomes a bottleneck in tropical forest inventories. Here we present a drone-based workflow to automatically acquire large volumes of close-up, ultra-high resolution photos of selected tree crowns (or specific locations over the canopy) to support tropical botanical and ecological studies (https://youtu.be/80goMEifpc4). Our workflow is built around the small, easy-to-use DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise (M3E) drone, which is equipped with a wide-angle and a telephoto camera. On day one, the pilot maps a forest area of up to ~200 ha with the wide-angle camera to generate a high-resolution digital surface model (DSM) and orthomosaic using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry. On subsequent days, the pilot acquires close-up photos with the telephoto camera from up to 300 selected canopy trees per day. These close-up photos are acquired from 6 m above the canopy and contain a high level of visual detail that allows botanists to reliably identify many tree and liana species. The photos are geolocated with survey-grade accuracy using RTK GNSS, thus facilitating spatial co-registration with other data sources, including the photogrammetry products. The primary operational challenge of our workflow is the need to maintain RTK corrections with the drone to ensure that close-up photos are acquired exactly at the predefined locations. The maximum operational range we achieved was 3 km, which would allow the pilot to reach any tree within a ~2800 ha area from the take-off point. Although our workflow was developed to support taxonomic identification of tropical trees and lianas, it could be extended to any other forest or vegetation type to support botanical, phenological, and ecological studies. We provide harpia, an open-source Python library to program these automatic close-up photo missions with the M3E drone (https://github.com/traitlab/harpia).","[{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRF3: AI, Biodiversity, and Climate Change;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2019-04537;""},{""name"":""Population Biology Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Ceiba Fund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

To address these questions, we performed molecular phylogenetic analysis of Lhcx/Lhcsr subfamilies and produced the Lhcx1 knockout mutants of the diatom Chaetoceros gracilis, which has low Lhcx redundancy. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that diatom Lhcxs and the green algal Lhcsrs evolved from a common ancestor, with green plants acquiring them through horizontal gene transfer. The Lhcx1 mutants of C. gracilis mostly abolished non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and the time-resolved fluorescence measurements clarified that Lhcx1-mediated quenching occurs in the energetically detached antenna complexes. Consistently, clear-native PAGE using Amphipol suggested that CgLhcx1 would interact with FCP L-dimer, functioning as a peripheral antenna for C2S2M2 PSII-FCPII. Notably, the lhcx1 mutant exhibited a higher PSII effective quantum yield than wild-type (WT) under high-light acclimation, attributed to reduced antenna size and enhanced carbon fixation capacity. The lack of NPQ accelerated high-light acclimation, with increased xanthophylls in lhcx1, indicating that compensatory mechanisms can lead to enhanced photosynthetic efficiency.

The fact that the proteins constitute a small portion of mRNAs and the ability of RNA to form highly specific three-dimensional binding pockets for small molecules have generated considerable interest in developing therapeutic agents that target RNAs as an alternative target for small-molecule drugs. Thus, like proteins, precise prediction of small-molecule binding sites across different classes of RNA targets could act as an starting point for drug discovery. In this study, we present a lightweight deep learning framework called Compound Binding Site Prediction for Ribonucleic Acid (CoBRA). This framework can predict ligand-binding nucleotides without requiring any explicit structural information. Our approach uses residue-level embeddings obtained from a pre-trained RNA language model. These embeddings encapsulate the contextual and statistical properties of each nucleotide and are used in a frozen state as the input for a multi-layer perceptron classifier performing binary classification of binding versus non-binding residues. The model was trained using combinations of ten distinct RNA language models and six different loss functions, using the TR60 and HARIBOSS datasets, and tested on four independent benchmark sets (RB9, JL10, TL12, and TE18). The performance of CoBRA demonstrates a relative improvement of 22.1% in Matthew correlation coefficient and an increase in sensitivity of 45.6% compared to existing state-of-the-art RNA-ligand binding site prediction methods with structural information. These results show that sequence-based language model embeddings alone, which do not require any explicit coordinate or distance information, can match or outperform structure-based methods. This makes it a flexible tool for predicting binding sites across diverse RNA targets. CoBRA is available at https://github.com/WonkyeongJang/CoBRA","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

In solution, NS5B exhibited temperature-dependent oligomerization that correlated with cooperative RNA binding and a conformational shift at micromolar concentrations. In contrast, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that membrane-bound NS5B forms stable, non-terminating oligomers at nanomolar concentrations, often localized near lipid raft domains. The presence of oligomers was correlated with membrane recruitment of RNA and nucleotides, suggesting functional activation. The lower concentration threshold for RNA binding on membranes may be explained by membrane-induced oligomerization that promotes the RNA-binding conformation of NS5B. Our findings are consistent with a model in which membrane association regulates NS5B's function through oligomerization-driven conformational control.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21AI148972;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

To reveal how these processes are mechanistically linked, we combined acute molecule perturbations in live cells with correlative 3D electron tomography or MINFLUX super-resolution microscopy. We show that degrading Nup62 during mitosis arrests NPC assembly at an intermediate step with smaller membrane pores and removes the whole central transport channel. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that 32 copies of the central channel subcomplex, recruited into the previously unoccupied pore center, can self-associate via hydrophobic interactions to occupy the volume required for full pore size and exert an outward pushing force; indeed, disrupting these interactions during NPC assembly blocked pore dilation. Later in mitotic exit, perturbed cells exhibited impaired nuclear import, smaller nuclei, and looser NE spacing. Acute inhibition of nuclear import recapitulated these NE defects without affecting NPC assembly. Together, our findings reveal a new, two-step molecular mechanism linking NPC assembly and NE reformation. First, hydrophobic FG-nucleoporins dilate the assembling nuclear pore to its full width by forming the central transport channel, which then allows nuclear import-driven nuclear expansion leading to tight, regular NE membrane spacing.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project-ID 511488495 - SFB 1638, P06;""},{""name"":""Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH/NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM083960;P41GM109824;R01GM112108;F32GM150243;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03tx8dq56"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

Graph neural networks have emerged as promising tools for this task, but most current approaches focus on local structural features and are trained on relatively small datasets, limiting their ability to model long-range protein-ligand interactions. Here, we develop YuelPocket, a new graph neural network that addresses these limitations through an innovative global graph design featuring a virtual joint node connecting all protein residues and small molecule atoms to capture long-range interactions while maintaining linear computational complexity. Trained on the comprehensive MOAD dataset containing over 38,000 protein-small molecule complexes, YuelPocket achieves exceptional performance with AUC-ROC values of 0.85 and 0.89 on COACH420 and Holo4k datasets, respectively.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM134864;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

Extant crocodilians possess platyrostral (broad and flat) snouts, thought to be sub-optimal for resisting feeding loads due to the conflicting demands of feeding and hydrodynamic constraints. In contrast, numerous Mesozoic crocodyliformes possessed oreinirostral (dome-shaped) skulls, were terrestrial and hence free from hydrodynamic constraint. This study aims to examine the role of function in determining skull shape in crocodyliformes, and assesses the difference in stress resistance between oreinirostral and platyrostral taxa. We hypothesise that in the absence of hydrodynamic constraints, oreinirostral taxa have skulls that are better suited for resisting feeding induced loads. Using finite element analysis (FEA), we evaluated biomechanical performance in oreinirostral notosuchian taxa Baurusuchus salgadoensis, Montealtosuchus arrudacamposi and Caipirasuchus paulistanus; compared to the extant platyrostral Alligator mississippiensis, Crocodylus niloticus, and Paleosuchus palpebrosus. Results show that oreinirostral morphologies are comparatively better suited for resisting forces generated during feeding, with increased muscular efficiency, supporting the hypothesis that hydrodynamic constraints influence crocodyliform skull evolution.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757455340830
