Mucosal IgA in salivary and nasal passages has a rapid response to antigens and can play a protective role against reinfection. The mainstay for analyzing SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine efficacy has been assessment of serum IgG levels; however, validated assays for assessment of mucosal IgA in clinical samples are necessary as new and adapted measures are generated to combat immune-evasive viral variants. A mucosal IgA assay was developed and tested through assessment of IgA levels in salivary samples from participants of the 2019nCoV-314/ NCT05973006 study. These participants had previously received [&ge;]2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations prior to enrollment and received a single intramuscular study dose of NVX-CoV2601 (XBB.1.5) or bivalent vaccine (NVX-CoV2601 + NVX-CoV2373 [Wuhan]). Salivary samples were collected prior to vaccination on day 0 and on day 28 to assess response post vaccination. Both vaccine groups elicited a significant increase in anti -SARS-CoV-2 spike IgA against XBB.1.5. Furthermore, cross-reactivity via identification of anti-JN.1 and anti-Wuhan IgA was also observed. The detection of IgA in clinical mucosal samples through this assay will be a valuable tool in supporting vaccine development.","NA","medrxiv",1737670077611

Maternally expressed transcription factors present in the embryo are essential for this process. However, it is unknown if active chromatin modifications established in the gamete are propagated in the embryo as an epigenetic memory to support ZGA and embryonic development. Here, we provide evidence that in Xenopus laevis, H3K4 methylation provides an epigenetic memory of active chromatin states. We show that this is required for faithful zygotic genome activation and successful embryonic development. Chromatin configurations of promoters displaying high H3K4me3 intensity and breadth, alongside DNA hypomethylation and increased GC content, are propagated from the gametes to the embryo across multiple cell divisions and a transcriptionally quiescent phase in early development. We show that this transmission of H3K4 methylation is essential for precise zygotic genome activation and expression of key pioneer ZGA transcription factors Pou5f3.2 and Sox3. Finally, we demonstrate that the H3K4 methyltransferases Kmt2b and Cxxc1 ensure transcription-independent propagation of H3K4me3 and proper zygotic gene expression. In summary, our study establishes the role of H3K4 methylation in maintaining memory of active chromatin states in Xenopus embryos and reveals its importance for successful embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Whereas RNA-binding proteins and noncoding RNAs have been implicated in cell division, their interplay during this process remains unknown. Here, we discover that RSRC2, an arginine/serine-rich RNA-binding protein, plays an essential role in cell division by interacting with the long non-coding RNA C1QTNF1-AS1. The loss of either RSRC2 or C1QTNF1-AS1 results in defects in chromosome congression and mitotic progression. We show that RSRC2 interacts with distinct sets of proteins involved in splicing and centrosome biogenesis, contributing to the fidelity of cell division through two different mechanisms: one linked to the splicing of mitotic regulators and the other by localising to mitotic centrosomes for which the interaction with the C1QTNF1-AS1 RNA is required. Our study uncovers RSRC2 as a new regulator of cell division and illustrates how RNA-protein complexes promote error-free mitosis.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

For SARS-CoV-2, much of the population has been imprinted by a viral spike from an early strain, either through vaccination or infection during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this imprinting, infection with more recent SARS-CoV-2 strains primarily boosts cross-reactive antibodies elicited by the imprinting strain. Here we compare the neutralizing antibody specificities of imprinted individuals versus infants infected with a recent strain. Specifically, we use pseudovirus-based deep mutational scanning to measure how spike mutations affect neutralization by the serum antibodies of adults and children imprinted by the original vaccine versus infants with a primary infection by a XBB* variant. While the serum neutralizing activity of the imprinted individuals primarily targets the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), serum neutralizing activity of infants only infected with XBB* mostly targets the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). In these infants, secondary exposure to the XBB* spike via vaccination shifts more of the neutralizing activity towards the RBD, although the specific RBD sites targeted are different than for imprinted adults. The dramatic differences in neutralization specificities among individuals with different exposure histories likely impact SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

The structure and interaction networks of molecules within condensates remain poorly understood. Using cryo-electron tomography and molecular dynamics simulations we elucidated the structure of phase separated chromatin condensates across scales, from individual amino acids to network architecture. We found that internucleosomal DNA linker length controls nucleosome arrangement and histone tail interactions, shaping the structure of individual chromatin molecules both within and outside condensates. This structural modulation determines the balance between intra- and intermolecular interactions, which in turn governs the molecular network, thermodynamic stability, and material properties of chromatin condensates. Mammalian nuclei contain dense clusters of nucleosomes whose non-random organization is mirrored by the reconstituted condensates. Our work explains how the structure of individual chromatin molecules ultimately determines physical properties of chromatin condensates, with implications for cellular chromatin organization.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

This underexplored phenomenon arises when microbial content is inadvertently exchanged among concurrently processed samples. Such contamination that distort microbial profiles, poses significant risks to the reliability of metagenomic data and downstream analyses. Despite its critical impact, this issue remains insufficiently addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce CroCoDeEL, a decision-support tool for detecting and quantifying cross-sample contamination. Leveraging a pre-trained supervised model, CroCoDeEL identifies contamination patterns in species abundance profiles with high accuracy. Unlike existing tools, it requires no negative controls or prior knowledge of sample processing positions, offering improved accuracy and versatility. Benchmarks across three public datasets demonstrate that CroCoDeEL accurately detects contaminated samples and identifies their contamination sources, even at low rates (<0.1%), provided sufficient sequencing depth. Our findings suggest that cross-sample contamination is prevalent in metagenomics and emphasize the necessity of systematically integrating contamination detection into sequencing data quality control.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

However, existing full-length single-cell RNA-sequencing methods suffer from multiple technical limitations, such as the pervasive presence of reverse transcription artifacts across genes. Here, we introduce Ouro-Seq, a novel single-cell long-read sequencing framework with a versatile artifact removal mechanism for characterizing full-length mRNA species expressed by individual cells. We also developed a computational pipeline that identifies genuine full-length cDNAs and normalizes full-length mRNA size distributions for integration. Using Ouro-Seq, we constructed the Mouse Single-Cell Long-Read Splicing Atlas by collecting full-length transcriptomes of 103,304 nuclei or cells from 12 major organs and tissues of adult mice. Our atlas comprehensively characterizes alternative splicing, alternative promoter usage, and alternative polyadenylation events across cell types, revealing previously unappreciated functional heterogeneity among individual cells. Different cell types exhibit largely distinct expression patterns of various isoforms, corresponding to their specific morphologies and biological functions. Our splicing atlas and generalized long-read frameworks will empower researchers to fully interpret biological variation across full-length transcriptomes of single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

The role of prothrombotic metabolites in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy remains elusive. Leveraging K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we observed higher levels of the tryptophan metabolite, kynurenine, compared to controls. SARS-CoV-2 infected mice showed a significant upregulation of enzymes controlling Kynurenine biogenesis, such as indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase levels in kidneys and liver, respectively, as well as changes in the enzymes involved in kynurenine catabolism, including kynurenine monooxygenase and kynurinase. Consistent with the agonistic role of these metabolites in Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) signaling, AHR activation and its downstream mediator, tissue factor (TF), a highly potent procoagulant factor, was observed in endothelial cells (ECs) of lungs and kidneys of infected mice. These findings were validated in humans, where compared to controls, sera of COVID-19 patients showed increased levels of Kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid. Activation of the AHR-TF axis was noted in the kidneys and lungs of COVID-19 patients, and COVID-19 sera showed higher IDO-1 activity than controls. Levels of Kyn in COVID-19 patients correlated strongly with the TF-inducing activity of COVID-19 sera on ECs. A specific IDO-1 inhibitor or AHR inhibitor separately or in combination suppressed COVID-19 sera-induced TF activity in ECs. Together, we identified IDO-1 as upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in augmented Kyn and its prothrombotic catabolites, thereby suggesting the Kyn-AHR-TF axis as possibly a new diagnostic and/or therapeutic target.

We show that cannabinoid administration increases the activity of central amygdala (CeA) somatostatin neurons (SOM) and alters basal network dynamics in a manner supporting generation of antagonistic sub-ensembles within the SOM population. Moreover, diverging neuronal population trajectory dynamics and enhanced antagonistic sub-ensemble representation of threat-related behaviors, and enhanced threat-related location representation, were also observed. Lastly, cannabinoid administration increased the proportion of SOM neurons exhibiting multidimensional representation of threat-related behaviors and behavior-location conjunction. While cannabinoid receptor activation ex vivo suppressed excitatory inputs to SOM neurons, our data suggest preferential suppression of local GABA release subserves cannabinoid activation of CeA SOM neurons. These data provide insight into how cannabinoid-mediated presynaptic suppression transforms postsynaptic population dynamics and reveal cellular mechanisms by which cannabinoids could affect threat-reactivity.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Bacteriophages, viruses of bacteria, are drivers of gut bacterial composition in the human gut and could affect bifidobacterial abundance. Here, we use a bioinformatics approach to explore the direct interactions occurring between human-associated Bifidobacterium spp. and prophages, as evidenced by their genomes. A total of 1,086 bifidobacterial genomes were analysed in this study, revealing complex systems to prevent viral invasion. Despite their characteristically small genomes, Bifidobacterium strains harboured more than double the number of defence systems as most bacteria. In total, 34 defence system types and 56 subtypes were detected, including several different CRISPR-Cas systems with spacers that targeted almost three-quarters of bifidobacteria-derived prophages. We identified at least one prophage which met our stringent quality control measures in [~]63% of strains, with phages exhibiting high genomic diversity and evidence of historical recombination. Additionally, prophages were found to encode various anti-defence systems, such as anti-CRISPR genes and restriction modification resistance mechanisms. In summary, our investigation reveals ""arms race"" dynamics drive genomic diversity in both bifidobacteria and their phages.

ImportanceMembers of the Bifidobacterium genus are widely acknowledged as being highly important for human health, particularly in infants. To date, there have been a limited number of large-scale studies that have investigated the presence of prophages and anti-viral defence systems of Bifidobacterium strains from multiple human-associated species. Here, we have uncovered a complex set of anti-phage strategies encoded by Bifidobacterium strains. In addition, we have also identified a highly diverse phage mobilome present within the genomes of bifidobacteria across the genus, which also encode several unique systems for overcoming bacterial defences. Elucidating these co-evolutionary dynamics between phages and bifidobacteria may provide valuable insight into developing high-throughput methods for identifying next-generation probiotic or live biotherapeutic candidates, which may then be applied for the prevention and treatment of various diseases in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Despite existing research, it remains unclear how the gut microbiome is affected by different intensities of PA, and how other lifestyle factors influence this relationship. Here we study the relation between PA intensity and gut microbiome composition and function in a large Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project dataset.

MethodsA cross-sectional design was performed on 5409 adults aged 40 to 60 from the community-based Lifelines Dutch Microbiome Project and from all these participants metagenomic shotgun data was available. Participants were categorized into sedentary (N=2501), moderate (N=1915), and vigorous (N=993) PA groups, based on self-reported activity levels. We investigated association between PA intensity and microbial diversity, bacterial species, and metabolic pathways by multiple regression models sequentially adjusted for the covariates age/sex, BMI, stool consistency and diet quality/alcohol intake.

ResultsVigorous PA, but not moderate PA, was significantly associated with higher gut microbiome alpha diversity (i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) as compared to sedentary PA. Compared to the sedentary group, the vigorous PA group showed a lower abundance of the bacterial species Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus ({beta} = -0.003, p = 0.042), even after extensive covariate adjustments and correction for multiple testing. Other species were initially also significantly associated with vigorous PA, but they disappeared after adjusting for covariates resulting in a loss of significance. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of two distinct metabolic pathways related to cellular energy recycling (Pyruvate fermentation to acetate and lactate II, {beta} = 8.11x10-05, p = 0.035) and purine metabolism (Purine ribonucleosides degradation, {beta} = 3.36x10-04, p = 0.039) in participants engaging in vigorous PA as compared to sedentary PA.

ConclusionsVigorous PA is associated with higher gut microbiome diversity and with specific alterations of microbial composition. The lower abundance of Lawsonibacter asaccharolyticus within the vigorous PA group may be linked to increased gut permeability. The identified enrichment of microbial fermentation and purine metabolism in vigorous PA hints at a potential role of PA in affecting gut microbiome functionality and host health. The results of our modeling strategy highlight the importance of adjusting for dietary covariates to understand how PA may impact the gut microbiome independently from other influences.","NA","medrxiv",1737670077611

The recent successful clinical trial of VX-548, a NaV1.8-selective inhibitor, has spurred much interest in expanding the arsenal of subtype-selective voltage-gated sodium channel therapeutics. Toward that end, we sought to determine whether NaVs are amenable to targeted protein degradation with small molecule degraders, namely proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) and molecular glues. Here, we report that degron-tagged NaVs are potently and rapidly degraded by small molecule degraders harnessing the E3 ubiquitin ligases cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel Lindau (VHL). Using LC/MS analysis, we demonstrate that PROTAC-mediated proximity between NaV1.8 and CRBN results in ubiquitination on the 2nd intracellular loop, pointing toward a potential mechanism of action and demonstrating the ability of CRBN to recognize a VGSC as a neosubstrate. Our foundational findings are an important first step toward realizing the immense potential of NaV-targeting degrader analgesics to combat chronic pain.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Anopheles funestus is the dominant malaria vector in Tanzania and most parts of East and Southern Africa. To better understand its population genomic structure in Tanzania, we sequenced the genomes of 334 individual An. funestus mosquitoes from 11 administrative regions. We found two genetically differentiated populations; one inland and at high altitude (found in Katavi, Kagera, Kigoma, and Mwanza) and a second coastal, at low altitude (found in Pwani, Morogoro, Tanga, Ruvuma, Mtwara, Dodoma, and Lindi), with differences in genetic diversity and inbreeding. We found asynchronous selective sweeps, associated with insecticide resistance phenotypes, at the Cyp9k1 gene, and Cyp6p gene cluster, with distinct copy number-variant profiles between the coastal and inland populations. These results suggest that inland and coastal An. funestus populations have divergent histories, with the arid, central region of Tanzania, which also contains the Rift Valley being a possible barrier to gene flow. Such population disconnectedness should be considered for insecticide deployment, resistance management, and the rollout of novel genetic-based vector control approaches. These findings provide the most detailed study of Tanzanian An. funestus population structure and resistance genetics to date. Future research should examine the epidemiological relevance of this discontinuity in gene flow and whether these populations have different malaria transmission abilities.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Complete anaerobic SQ degradation via interspecies metabolite transfer to sulfonate-respiring bacteria produces hydrogen sulfide, which has dose- and context-dependent health effects. Here, we studied potential SQ degradation by the mammalian host and the impact of SQ supplementation on human and murine gut microbiota diversity and metabolism. 13CO2 breath tests with germ-free C57BL/6 mice gavaged with 13C-SQ were negative. Also, SQ was not degraded by human intestinal cells in vitro, indicating that SQ is not directly metabolized by mice and humans. Addition of increasing SQ concentrations to human fecal microcosms revealed dose-dependent responses of the microbiota and corroborated the relevance of Agathobacter rectalis and Bilophila wadsworthia in cooperative degradation of SQ to hydrogen sulfide via interspecies transfer of 2,3-dihydroxy-1-propanesulfonate (DHPS). Similar to the human gut microbiome, the genetic capacity for SQ or DHPS degradation is sparsely distributed among bacterial species in the mouse gut. Escherichia coli and Enterocloster clostridioformis were identified as primary SQ degraders in the mouse gut. SQ and DHPS supplementation experiments with conventional laboratory mice and their intestinal contents showed that SQ was incompletely catabolized to DHPS. Although some E. clostridioformis genomes encode an extended sulfoglycolytic pathway for both SQ and DHPS fermentation, SQ was only degraded to DHPS by a mouse-derived E. clostridioformis strain. Our findings suggest that SQ is solely a nutrient for the gut microbiota and not for mice and humans, emphasizing its potential as a prebiotic. SQ degradation by the mouse microbiota differs from the human gut microbiota by absence of DHPS degradation activity. Hence, the microbiota of conventional laboratory mice does not fully represent the SQ metabolism in humans, indicating the need for alternative model systems to assess the impact of SQ on human health. This study advances our understanding of how individual dietary compounds shape the microbial community structure and metabolism in the gut and thereby potentially influence host health.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Stomata serve as gatekeepers on plant leaves, regulating both CO2 capture for photosynthesis and the concomitant release of water. At higher CO2 concentrations or higher vapour pressure deficit (VPD), stomatal pores narrow, reducing stomatal conductance to water vapour (gsw) and transpiration (E)2-6. Increasing temperatures and/or nitrogen fertilisation promote an opposite stomatal response, enhancing gsw and E7,8. With atmospheric CO2 concentration, temperature and VPD predicted to rise throughout this century1, it is unclear how crops will modify stomatal gaseous exchanges, particularly under differing N-fertilisation regimes. Here, we show in wheat (Triticum aestivum), that elevated CO2 does not reduce gsw or E during heatwaves when VPD is high, instead plant water usage increases. High-VPD heatwave events also impact stomatal responsiveness to N-fertiliser application, prompting significantly higher gas exchange contributions from abaxial leaf surfaces, irrespective of CO2 growth conditions. Dynamic stomatal responsiveness to light and high CO2 are also attenuated during heatwaves in a CO2-independent manner. Taken together, our data suggests that future wheat crops will use significantly more water during heatwaves than might be expected, which has substantial implications for future global food security.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

While bacteriophages have developed various anti-CRISPR strategies to counteract these immune systems, the role of bacterial host factors in enhancing CRISPR-Cas functions has been relatively unexplored. In this study, we employ an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approach to systematically analyze potential interactions between Escherichia coli (E. coli) proteins and fifteen previously uncharacterized Cas12 proteins, generating 65,715 predicted binary complex structures. Our findings reveal a previously unknown dimension of CRISPR immunity, demonstrating that the hosts ubiquitous redox enzyme, thioredoxin (TrxA), significantly enhances the DNA cleavage efficiency of a phage-encoded, miniature Cas12 nuclease (termed  Cas12 hacker). This synergistic relationship represents a strategic inversion, where a bacteriophage hijacks a host protein to reinforce its own genome degradation machinery, possibly targeting rival nucleic acids. Through comprehensive biochemical characterizations, structural analyses of the Cas12 hacker-TrxA-sgRNA-dsDNA quaternary complex, and in vivo bacterial defense assays, we uncover an intricate association in which thioredoxin binds to and activates the Cas12 hacker nuclease, intensifying its DNA cleavage capacity and bolstering CRISPR immunity.

We developed a multifactorial traumatic brain injury model in piglets which mirrors the evolving pathophysiology of severe pediatric TBI, showing age-dependent hypoxic-ischemic cerebral cortical injury and matrix metalloproteinase-driven vasogenic edema, with infant piglets experiencing less tissue damage than toddler piglets. Extracellular matrix breakdown can precipitate neuronal dysfunction, disrupting chloride homeostasis and the reversal potential for GABA. We hypothesized that ongoing tissue damage might be related to markers of ""immature GABA"", evaluated by changes to the expression and phosphorylation of sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1), potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2), and a regulatory kinase, (STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein kinase) SPAK. We mapped these markers in developing swine and infant human brain, identifying a postnatal pNKCC1 decrease in human infant hippocampus, and a perinatal cortical and hippocampal GABA switch in pigs, with no change in the thalamus. In infant piglets with severe TBI, upregulation of neuronal pNKCC1 correlated with hypoxic-ischemic injury and seizure duration. We also observed dysregulation of NKCC1, KCC2, and SPAK in cortex and hippocampus in infant and toddler piglets with severe TBI, with thalamus unchanged. We noted ectopic, non-apical localization of pNKCC1 signal in choroid plexus epithelium across ages in piglets and humans with severe TBI, indicating acute dysregulation of the CSF chloride milieu. These findings position swine as a useful model for pediatric TBI research and suggest that SPAK or NKCC1 inhibition in infants may be therapeutic.

Significance statementSevere TBI in early childhood, the majority of which is due to abuse, remains an understudied area of neurotrauma. Our piglet model effectively replicates the pathophysiology of severe pediatric TBI, capturing age-dependent injury patterns and mechanisms of spreading hypoxic-ischemic injury throughout the cortical ribbon. We identified upregulation of neuronal-pNKCC1 in infant piglets, but not toddler piglets with severe TBI, and found this correlates with injury severity, seizure duration, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our findings indicate that treatments targeted to inhibit neuronal NKCC1 might alleviate evolving brain injury in infants with severe TBI. This model provides a valuable platform for studying mechanisms of TBI and testing new interventions, potentially advancing therapeutic strategies for pediatric brain injury where stopping traumatic seizures is difficult.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

How nascent mitochondrial precursors acquire and sustain import-competence in the cytosol under normal and stress conditions is incompletely understood. Here, we show that under normal conditions, the Hsc70 and Hsp90 systems interact with and redundantly minimize precursor degradation. During acute import stress, Hsp90 buffers precursor degradation, preserving proteins in an import-competent state until stress resolution. Unexpectedly, buffering by Hsp90 relies critically on a mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS), the absence of which greatly decreases precursor-Hsp90 interaction. Site-specific photo-crosslinking and biochemical reconstitution showed how the MTS directly engages co-chaperones of Hsc70 (St13 and Stip1) and Hsp90 (p23 and Cdc37) to facilitate chaperone retention on the mature domain. Thus, the MTS has a previously unappreciated role in regulating chaperone dynamics on mitochondrial precursors to buffer their degradation and maintain import competence, functions that may facilitate restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis after acute import stress.

Of particular concern is ice-rich, organic-rich, syngenetic ""yedoma"" type permafrost. The lability of organic carbon in permafrost post-thaw largely depends on the rate at which microorganisms resuscitate and proliferate after thousands of years in below-freezing, dark, anaerobic conditions. However, the resuscitation and growth rates of microorganisms in deep permafrost are unknown. To quantify these rates, we conducted lipid stable isotope probing (lipid-SIP) on permafrost cores collected from four locations within the Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, Alaska. We compare rates of microbial growth, marker gene sequences, and greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4) emissions across cores held anaerobically at ambient and elevated temperatures. In deep, ancient permafrost, microbial biomass turnover is exceedingly slow, often undetectable, within the first month following thaw. Our results indicate microbial growth in response to anaerobic thaw has a notable lag period, where only 0.001 - 0.01% of cells turn over per day. This suggests a  slow reawakening that could provide some buffer between anomalous warmth and C degradation if permafrost refreezes seasonally. However, within six months, microbial communities undergo dramatic restructuring and succession, producing communities that are distinct from both the emplaced ancient and overlying surface communities. These results have critical implications for predictions of microbial biogeochemical contributions in a warming arctic, especially as thaw proceeds into deeper and more ancient permafrost horizons.

Plain Language SummaryPermafrost, earth material like soil, rock, or ice continually frozen for more than two years, contains more organic carbon than is currently in the atmosphere as CO2. As the Arctic warms and permafrost thaws, ancient microbes can reactivate, allowing the degradation of organic carbon that has accumulated in permafrost over millenia, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases. In this work, we measured the rates at which permafrost microorganisms resuscitate during thaw and related these growth rates to changes in microbial community composition and greenhouse gas emissions.

Key PointsO_LIMicrobial growth is extremely slow within the first 30 days of thaw. Temperature may drive which taxa are active, but not growth rates.
C_LIO_LISubsurface microbes show a preference for glycolipids over phospholipids, suggesting a possible cryotolerance adaptation.
C_LIO_LIAncient, entrapped gases may be the primary source of emissions in early thaw stages.

To address this, we monitored microbial dynamics in two microalgae biomass production raceways over two 8-month intervals inoculated with Desmodesmus armatus. One reactor was fed with wastewater, while the other received clean water and fertilizers. Metabarcoding of the 18S and 16S rRNA genes revealed a high microbial diversity across two time series, showing thousands of eukaryotic and prokaryotic species growing alongside the microalgae. Chlorophyta and Fungi were the dominant eukaryotic groups, while Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidia dominated the prokaryotic communities. We found contrasting ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variant) patterns between healthy (D. armatus abundance >70%) and unhealthy (D. armatus abundance <20%) microbiomes, across reactors and time series. Network analysis identified up to 10 potential ecological interactions among D. armatus and its microbiome, predominantly positive. Our results suggest a link between microbiome composition and D. armatus abundance. Specifically, ASVs associated with a healthy microbiome were positively correlated with D. armatus, while ASVs characteristic of an unhealthy microbiome were negatively correlated. Potentially pathogenic bacteria included Mycobacterium and Flavobacterium, whereas potentially beneficial taxa included Geminocystis, Thiocapsa, Ahniella and Bosea. Several fungal ASVs showed context-specific associations, whereas specific P. tribonemae, A. parallelum, A. desmodesmi, Aphelidiomycota sp., Rozellomycota sp. and, Rhizophidium sp. ASVs were identified as potentially harmful. This study reveals the striking diversity and complexity of microalgae-associated microbiomes within raceways, providing valuable insights for optimizing industrial production processes, particularly for wastewater treatment and sustainable green biomass generation.

Polyploid genomes are expected to undergo chromosomal rearrangements and gene losses over time, potentially affecting supergene architecture. The iconic distyly supergene (S-locus), controlling a floral heteromorphism with two self-incompatible morphs, has been well-documented in diploids, but remains unknown in polyploids. Primula, the classic model for distyly since Darwin, is ancestrally diploid and distylous, yet polyploid, homostylous species with a single, self-compatible floral morph evolved repeatedly. The intraspecific loss of distyly is associated with small loss-of-function mutations in the S-locus CYPT gene controlling style length and female self-incompatibility. Over longer timescales, relaxed selection on CYPT should generate greater accumulation of larger mutations, including exon and gene loss. By analyzing the first assembled genome of an allotetraploid, homostylous species (Primula grandis) in a comparative framework, we discovered two, nearly identical S-locus alleles in the same subgenome, suggesting it originated via inter-specific hybridization between a homostylous and a distylous progenitor. Conformant to predictions from theory, the macroevolutionary loss of distyly coincided with considerable degeneration of CYPT, while other S-locus genes remained largely unaffected, suggesting the shift to homostyly preceded and facilitated polyploid establishment. At the whole-genome level, we found minimal subgenome dominance - as expected, given the inferred recent origin of P. grandis - and highly reduced genetic diversity, congruently with its narrow distribution and self-compatibility. This study provides the first comparison of a supergene across ploidy levels and reproductive systems, contributing new knowledge on the previously unknown fate of supergenes in polyploids.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

We identified a predominant spinal input from a distinct subset of genetically-defined V0C cholinergic interneurons. We found that these interneurons receive phasic excitation from brainstem respiratory centers, augment phrenic output through M2 muscarinic receptors, and are highly activated under a hypercapnia challenge.

Traditionally linked to genomic imprinting, these effects are believed to have evolved from parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring, which results in opposing parental genetic influences. Despite their potential importance, POEs remain heavily understudied in complex traits, largely due to the lack of parental genomes.

Here, we present a multi-step approach to infer the parent-of-origin of alleles without parental genomes, leveraging inter-chromosomal phasing, mitochondrial and chromosome X data, and sibling-based crossover inference. Applied to the UK Biobank (discovery cohort) and Estonian Biobank (replication cohort), this scalable approach enabled parent-of-origin inference for up to 221,062 individuals, representing the largest dataset of its kind.

GWAS scans in the UK Biobank for more than 60 complex traits and over 2,400 protein levels contrasting maternal and paternal effects identified over 30 novel POEs and confirmed more than 50% of testable known associations. Notably, approximately half of our POEs exhibited a bi-polar pattern, where maternal and paternal alleles exert conflicting effects. These effects were particularly prevalent for traits related to growth (e.g., IGF-1, height, fat-free mass) and metabolism (e.g., type 2 diabetes, triglycerides, glucose). Replication in the Estonian Biobank and in 45,402 offspring from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study validated over 75% of testable associations.

The studies presented here indicate that immunization with nucleoside modified mRNA-LNP vaccines drives myeloid cell expression of the cytokine IL-27, which acts on antigen-specific CD8+ T cells to sustain T cell expansion. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that type I IFN signaling is necessary for mRNA-LNP-induced IL-27 production, that immunization failed in IL-27 KO mice, and that immunization of IFNAR1-deficient mice with mRNA-LNP particles that also encode IL-27 mRNA restored antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In addition, IL-27 mRNA-LNPs served as an adjuvant that improved cytolytic CD8+ T cell responses and the therapeutic efficacy of mRNA-LNPs to drive anti-pathogen and anti-tumor immunity. These studies highlight the central role of IL-27 in mRNA-LNP induced CD8+ T cell responses and the ability of this cytokine to augment the functionality of the CD8+ T cell response for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

We performed a longitudinal study of aging female (n = 40) and male (n = 47) C57BL/6NIA mice, measured frailty index and derived metabolomics data from plasma samples. We identify differentially abundant metabolites related to aging, determine frailty related metabolites via a machine learning approach, and generate a union set of frailty features, both in the whole cohort and in sex-stratified subgroups. Using the features, we perform an association study and build a metabolomics-based frailty clock. We find that frailty related metabolites are enriched for amino acid metabolism and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, include ergothioneine, tryptophan, and alpha-ketoglutarate, and present sex dimorphism. We identify B vitamin metabolism related flavin adenine dinucleotide and pyridoxate as female-specific frailty biomarkers, and lipid metabolism related sphingomyelins, glycerophosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine as male-specific frailty biomarkers. These associations are confirmed in a validation cohort, with ergothioneine and perfluorooctanesulfonate identified as robust frailty biomarkers. In summary, our results identify sex-specific metabolite biomarkers of frailty in aging, and shed light on potential mechanisms involved in frailty.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

In Arabidopsis thaliana, SL biosynthesis mutants exhibit increased shoot branching and early flowering, underscoring their roles in developmental regulation. Shoot branching inhibition in Arabidopsis depends on the methylation of carlactonoic acid (CLA), a key intermediate classified as a noncanonical SL, catalyzed by CLA methyltransferase (CLAMT). Canonical SLs primarily function as rhizosphere signals, with their biosynthesis in dicots mediated by CYP722C enzymes. It is hypothesized that Arabidopsis does not produce canonical SL because of the lack of the CYP722C genes in its genome. Instead, Arabidopsis possesses CYP722A1, a member of the previously uncharacterized CYP722A subfamily, distinct from the CYP722C subfamily. This study demonstrates that Arabidopsis cyp722a1 mutants exhibit an earlier floral transition without excessive shoot branching. Biochemical analysis revealed that CYP722A1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of CLA to produce 16-hydroxy-CLA (16-HO-CLA), which is subsequently methylated by CLAMT to form 16-HO-MeCLA. 16-HO-CLA and 16-HO-MeCLA were detected in the wild-type; however, these compounds were absent in max1-4 mutant, which is deficient in CLA synthesis, and in cyp722a1 mutant. These findings indicate the presence of CYP722A1-dependent 16-hydroxylation activity of CLA in Arabidopsis. Moreover, they suggest that hydroxylated CLA specifically regulates floral transition, distinct from branching inhibition. By identifying CYP722A1 as a regulator of floral transition, which is the distinct role of the CYP722A subfamily, this work provides insights into the adaptation of SL structures for specialized biological functions in plant development.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Tracking T and B cell repertoires in situ at single-cell resolution is essential for understanding adaptive immune responses. To address the lack of tools for in situ single-cell T/BCR (XCR) sequencing, we developed Stereo-XCR-seq, an efficient strategy for retrieving and sequencing TCR and BCR from Stereo-seq cDNA libraries at subcellular resolution. Stereo-XCR-seq provides unbiased full-length XCR reads alongside spatial transcriptomics, enabling the identification of heterogeneous lymphoid aggregates with distinct clonal activities in cancers and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We identified plasma cell aggregates that differ from tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in both transcriptomic profiles and clonal activities, with spatial positioning potentially mediating unique immune responses. Collectively, Stereo-XCR-seq enables in situ single-cell profiling of T and B cell clonal activities within tissue microenvironments, providing insights into lymphocyte adaption to environmental stimuli. This technology provides potential for advancing our understanding of tissue immunity and the development of therapeutic strategies for immune disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Previously, we showed that pathogenic LRRK2 mutations inhibit primary cilia formation in rare interneurons and astrocytes of the mouse and human dorsal striatum. This blocks Hedgehog signaling and reduces synthesis of neuroprotective GDNF and NRTN, which support neurons vulnerable in PD. Here we show that GBA1 mutations also impair Hedgehog signaling through a distinct mechanism. Loss of GBA1 activity decreases accessible cholesterol in primary cilia of cultured cells, thereby disrupting Hedgehog signaling. In the mouse striatum, Gba1 mutations result in reduced Hedgehog-induced Gdnf RNA expression in cholinergic interneurons, despite having no detectable impact on cilia formation. Also, both Lrrk2 and Gba1 mutations suppress Hedgehog-induced Bdnf expression in striatal astrocytes. These findings underscore the role of Hedgehog signaling in the nigrostriatal circuit and reveal a convergent mechanism by which distinct mutations may contribute to PD pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

In addition, there is a need to better understand the relevance of attentional abilities in mediating autistic features. Using connectome-based predictive modelling, we interrogate three datasets to determine scanning conditions that can boost prediction of clinically relevant phenotypes and assess generalizability. In dataset one, a sample of youth with autism and neurotypical participants, we find that a sustained attention task (the gradual onset continuous performance task) results in high prediction performance of autistic traits compared to a free-viewing social attention task and a resting-state condition. In dataset two, we observe the predictive network model of autistic traits generated from the sustained attention task generalizes to predict measures of attention in neurotypical adults. In dataset three, we show the same predictive network model of autistic traits from dataset one further generalizes to predict measures of social responsiveness in data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.

One key strategy involves enzymatic oxidation of N-terminal cysteine residues coupled with proteolysis through the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway. Despite the presence of hundreds of proteins with N-terminal cysteine in humans, only two have been identified as substrates of this pathway, and its substrate selectivity remains unclear. Moreover, the biological role of this pathway in the cellular response to hypoxia is not well defined. By employing a systematic proteomics approach, we discovered that nearly half of the cysteine-commencing proteome could be regulated by the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway. Mutagenesis experiments revealed the specificty of Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway showing a preference for hydrophobic and positively charged residues following cysteine. Furthermore, we uncovered substrates that are regulated by this pathway during hypoxia, including IP6K1. The loss of IP6K1 impaired glucose uptake, glycolytic ATP production, and overall mitochondrial morphology and function. As a result, IP6K1-deficient cells exhibited disrupted metabolic adaptation under hypoxic conditions and decreased survival under stress. These findings underscore the importance of the Cys-Arg/N-degron pathway in regulating metabolic responses and highlight its potential importance in hypoxia-related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Studies seeking to understand the underlying mechanisms have mostly focused on neurogenetic comparisons with extant species. Here we ask if developmental tempo differences may have also existed between us and our extinct relatives for whom genomes are available. To do so, we nominate a sapiens-specific derived allele, virtually fixed in contemporary populations, which resides in an enhancer region active during early cortical development. The single nucleotide variant is predicted to significantly affect CHD2 expression, a chromatin remodeler known to play an important role in neural development and for which haploinsufficiency is associated with epilepsy and autism. We leverage patient induced pluripotent stem lines (iPSC) and engineered iPSCs in which we reintroduced the ancestral allele and generated heterozygous loss-of-function mutations. We reveal that CHD2 deficiency impairs lysosomal acidification and autophagosome flux. In contrast, ancestralized lines, which we find express higher levels of CHD2, exhibit enhanced lysosomal function and consequently accelerated autophagosome flux, consistent with our observations in chimpanzee and bonobo lines. This set of findings demonstrates that CHD2 dosage critically regulates the autolysosomal pathway. Through deep phenotyping of cortical organoid and neuron cultures, we show that the CHD2-modulated autolysosomal pathway impacts the timing of developmental programs, acquisition of neuronal functional properties and circuit maturation. Finally, we validate an estrogen-dependent rewiring of CHD2 regulation in the evolution of our lineage, providing a mechanistic understanding of how a single nucleotide variant in a regulatory region contributed to the modern pace of neuronal development and maturation. Together, our findings establish CHD2 as a regulator in setting neurodevelopmental tempo via the autolysosomal pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Here, we first identified locomotor activity as a trait transmissible through the gut microbiome in mice. We then performed a selection experiment, where we serially transferred microbiomes from low-activity mice to independently bred germ-free mice. Over four transfer rounds, microbiome transfer significantly reduced locomotor activity. Reduced locomotion was associated with increased Lactobacilli and their metabolite indolelactate. In a test of causality, independent administration to the mouse gut of Lactobacillus johnsonii or indolelactate reduced locomotion. These findings demonstrate that selection and transmission of microbes can modulate host traits independently of selection on the mammalian genome.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

To address this gap, we developed PiCTURE, a standardized computational pipeline for detecting and quantifying transcriptome-wide CBE-induced RNA off-target events. PiCTURE identifies both canonical ACW (W = A or T/U) motif-dependent and non-canonical RNA off-targets, revealing a broader WCW motif that underlies many unanticipated edits. Additionally, we developed two machine learning models based on the DNABERT-2 language model, termed STL and SNL, which outperformed motif-only approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. To demonstrate the practical application of our predictive model for CBE-induced RNA off-target risk, we integrated PiCTURE outputs with the PROTECTiO pipeline and estimated RNA off-target risk for each transcript showing tissue-specific expression. The analysis revealed differences among tissues: while the brain and ovaries exhibited relatively low off-target burden, the colon and lungs displayed relatively high risks.

Positive delta in adults is normally interpreted as implying that an individual is aging (or has aged) faster than the population norm, an indicator of unhealthy aging. Unfortunately, from cross-sectional (single timepoint) imaging data, it is impossible to know whether a single individual's positive delta reflects a state of faster ongoing aging, or an unvarying trait (in other words, a ""historical baseline effect"" in the context of the population being studied). However, for a cross-sectional dataset comprising many individuals, one could attempt to disambiguate the overall relative contributions of varying aging rates vs. fixed baseline effects. We present a method for doing this, and show that for the most common approaches, which estimate a single delta per subject, baseline effects are likely to dominate. If instead one estimates multiple biologically distinct modes of brain aging, we find that some modes do reflect aging rates varying strongly across subjects. We demonstrate this, and verify our modelling, using longitudinal (two timepoint) data from 4,400 participants in UK Biobank. In addition, whereas previous work found incompatibility between cross-sectional and longitudinal brain aging, we show that careful data processing does show consistency between cross-sectional and longitudinal results.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

We additionally tested individuals born without hands to control for hand motor imagery when performing foot actions. We show that the primary sensorimotor cortices have hand and foot selectivity, consistent with a somatotopic organization.

Multivariate decoding of action-type in these areas generalized between controls' hand and foot and was successful in individuals born without hands. Finally, the temporal dynamics pattern in primary and association areas carried effector-specific and action-type information, respectively. Altogether, we show that the tool-use network in motor association areas represents higher-order action information beyond concrete motor parameters associated with specific effectors, and regardless of hand motor experience.

We observed early dynamics in nucleolar-nucleoplasmic proteome localization and identified nucleolar replication stress signatures involving chromatin remodeling networks, transcription-replication conflicts and DNA repair. Our findings define localized surveillance mechanisms that activate the nDDR. Further, we identified that upon rDNA damage, nucleolar RNA Polymerase (Pol) II binds to intergenic rDNA sequences and generates R-loops (DNA:RNA hybrid structures) that are essential for recruiting nDDR factors.

Combining both subspecies in quantitative genetic analyses could enhance genetic improvement, however, this requires appropriately modelling their genetic history. The ancestral recombination graph (ARG) is an effective population genetics tool that comprehensively and succinctly represents a species genetic history. This study evaluated the use of an ARG, encoded as a tree sequence, to improve quantitative genetic analyses of indica and japonica rice. Using data from Uruguays National Rice Breeding Program, we inferred ancestral alleles, constructed and dated an ARG, and examined its application in genomic prediction and genome-wide association studies. We compared the predictive ability of a branch-based relationship matrix (BRM) built from an ARG against conventional relationship matrices from pedigree and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site data. We then estimated BRMs SNP site effects to identify potential sites of interest and better understand how these map onto the tree sequence branches. The results showed that the ARG captured key biological signals, encoded genomic data more efficiently than conventional formats, and resulted in the highest predictive ability when combining both subspecies. Although the ARG-based approach did not substantially outperform conventional approaches for between-species prediction, this approach holds promise for plant breeding with larger datasets and could enhance genome-wide association studies by elucidating haplotype ancestry and the evolution of their value. Overall, our results demonstrated the potential of ARGs for the quantitative genetic analysis of diverse populations.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

This weight cycling has been demonstrated, in humans and animal models, to increase cardiometabolic disease and disrupt glucose homeostasis. Obesity itself, and to an even greater extent weight regain, causes adipose tissue inflammation, resulting in metabolic dysfunction. Studies show that even after weight loss, increased numbers of lipid associated macrophages and memory T cells persist in adipose tissue and become more inflammatory upon weight regain. These findings suggest that the immune system retains a ""memory"" of obesity, which may contribute to the elevated inflammation and metabolic dysfunction associated with weight cycling. Here, we show that blocking the CD70-CD27 axis, critical for formation of immunological memory, decreases the number of memory T cells and reduces T cell clonality within adipose tissue after weight loss and weight cycling. Furthermore, while mice with impaired ability to create obesogenic immune memory have similar metabolic responses as wildtype mice to stable obesity, they are protected from the worsened glucose tolerance associated with weight cycling. Our data are the first to target metabolic consequences of weight cycling through an immunomodulatory mechanism. Thus, we propose a new avenue of therapeutic intervention by which targeting memory T cells can be leveraged to minimize the adverse consequences of weight cycling. These findings are particularly timely given the increasing use of efficacious weight loss drugs, which will likely lead to more instances of human weight cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

While spores offer high transformation efficiency, they result in diverse genetic backgrounds due to sexual reproduction. Conversely, thallus- and gemma-based methods maintain genetic consistency but are impractical for large-scale applications. To address these limitations, we developed a novel chopped-thallus transformation method. This technique involves generating numerous plant fragments by chopping thalli, eliminating the need for complex preprocessing. The method demonstrated superior transformation efficiency compared to traditional approaches and achieved sufficient numbers of transformants using simplified Gamborg's B5 medium, previously considered suboptimal. This scalable and straightforward method enables the generation of large numbers of genetically consistent transformants, facilitating high-throughput experiments, including mutant screening and other large-scale applications.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

However, a complete understanding of task structure often requires knowledge of the actions available at each state (analogous to the moves of different pieces on a chessboard). Moreover, action representations are key to several models of the hippocampal-entorhinal system. In this study, we tested whether the entorhinal cortex represents the actions that allow transitioning between states of a conceptual space. In particular, participants learned to transition between numerically-labelled states using different mathematical operations. Behaviourally, participants learned and generalised action information across states. Action information was also reflected in eye movements, indicating the active processing of the possible actions for a given state during the trials. Importantly, we found that neural pattern similarity in the right entorhinal cortex scaled with the similarity of action affordances across the states. This affordance representation was not explained by other properties of the task space such as link distance between the states or action magnitude. In sum, this study provides first evidence for the integration of action information into ocular and entorhinal representations of conceptual spaces, suggesting that these may not just store experiences, but provide information about how to explore knowledge.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Yet, to date, no predictive theory incorporates the feedback between ecology and evolution while accounting for the evolution of genetic variance under selection, mutation, dispersal, and genetic drift. This study outlines a comprehensive theory showing that under joint evolutionary and population dynamics, the limits of adaptation are fundamentally determined by the three measurable parameters: i) the effective environmental gradient, ii) the effective rate of temporal change, and iii) the neighbourhood size, which represents the local population size accessible via dispersal. Dispersal across heterogeneous environments supports higher local genetic variance, facilitating adaptation to a faster temporal change. However, local diversity is depleted by genetic drift, which is measured by the inverse of neighbourhood size. Extending earlier predictions in stable environments, I use scaling arguments to derive a generalized expansion threshold - a tipping point where adaptation fails and the species range can no longer expand. Beyond this threshold, species ranges also tend to fragment, particularly when temporal change incurs a high fitness cost. The onset of fragmentation is rapid and associated with a loss of genetic variance. The theory not only identifies new phenomena but also establishes a fundamental relationship between these core measurable parameters. It provides a predictive framework for understanding species range and niche limits while advancing the theoretical foundations for assessing population resilience of spatially structured populations under unprecedented environmental change.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

Here we demonstrate that KCC2 expression is decreased in superficial dorsal horn neurons of organ donors who died with a documented history of pain, or of long-term opioid use. We show profoundly decreased KCC2 dorsal horn membrane expression in a primary cohort associated with either chronic pain or opioid use, and in a replication cohort of mixed chronic pain and opioid use history.

Contrary to expectations, our findings revealed that individuals trained on tasks with similar low-dimensional structures performed worse than those trained on dissimilar tasks. Magnetoencephalography revealed correlated neural representations in the samestructure group and anticorrelated ones in the different-structure group. Crucially, practice reduced this performance gap and shifted the neural representations of the tasks in the samestructure group towards anticorrelation, like those in the different-structure group. A neural network model trained on similar tasks replicated these findings: tasks with similar structures require more iterations to orthogonalize their representations.

In the past decade, naive hPSCs, representing a pre-implantation stage, have been derived. Naive hPSCs efficiently differentiate towards embryonic and extraembryonic lineages such as trophectoderm, primitive endoderm, and extraembryonic mesoderm, and also self-organize into blastocyst-like structures called blastoids. However, their culture typically relies on mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which are variable, resource-intensive, and can confound analyses. We report the long-term maintenance of naive hPSCs in a feeder-free, serum-coated system. We successfully expanded for up to 25 passages 8 different naive hPSCs lines across 5 laboratories. Growth rate, clonogenicity, and gene expression profiles on serum coating were comparable to MEF-based cultures, but serum coating eliminated fibroblast contamination. Naive hPSCs cultured on serum exhibited more efficient germ layer specification, retained trophectoderm potential and high blastoid formation efficiency. Exome sequencing revealed fewer mutations in serum-cultured cells, and mass spectrometry identified extracellular matrix proteins such as vitronectin, fibronectin, and collagens in the serum coating. Overall, serum coating offers a scalable, cost-effective and therefore widely applicable alternative for naive hPSC culture, maintaining developmental potential, reducing DNA mutations, and eliminating MEF-related confounding factors. We believe serum coating will expand the use of naive hPSCs to large-scale studies and facilitate the investigation of mechanistic insights into developmental and disease modelling.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

These events are associated with innate training and can have long-term impacts on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) development but can also compromise their function. While many cytokines support emergency myelopoiesis, less is known about the mechanisms that temper these events. When mice that lack the cytokine IL-27 were infected with Toxoplasma gondii, there was enhanced generation of monocyte progenitors and increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes. In the bone marrow of infected mice there was increased production of IL-27 that localized with HSPCs and a survey of cytokine receptor expression highlighted that HSPCs were uniquely poised to respond to IL-27. Furthermore, the use of in vitro differentiation assays and mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that HSPCs from IL-27 deficient mice are pre-disposed towards the monocyte lineage. Additional studies highlighted that after infection loss of the IL-27R resulted in reduced HSPC fitness that manifested as reduced proliferative responses and a decreased ability to reconstitute the hematopoietic system. Thus, the ability of IL-27 to act on HSPC provides a regulatory brake on differentiation to limit monocyte induction and preserve HSPC stemness.","NA","biorxiv",1737670077611

CEP290 was found throughout the connecting cilium between the microtubules and membrane, with nine-fold symmetry. In the absence of CEP290 ciliogenesis occurs, but the connecting cilium membrane is aberrant, and sub-structures, such as the ciliary necklace and Y-links, are defective or absent throughout the mid to distal connecting cilium. Transition zone proteins AHI1 and NPHP1 were abnormally restricted to the proximal connecting cilium in the absence of CEP290, while others like NPHP8 and CEP89 were unaffected. Although outer segment disc formation is inhibited in CEP290 mutant retina, we observed large numbers of extracellular vesicles.

At the molecular and cellular level, the renormalization of synaptic weights during sleep has received substantial support, which is thought to free capacity to encode new information at the behavioral level. However, at the systems level and behaviorally, support for this process playing a major role for memory function remains scarce. In the current study, we investigated the utility of moderate- and high-intensity evening exercise as a low-cost low-tech intervention to modulate sleep and its influence on subsequent encoding in the morning. Our findings indicate that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved post-sleep memory performance with effects lasting up to 24 hours after initial encoding. In addition, we show that especially the early parts of the encoding task were affected by the HIIT intervention, which is in line with increases in synaptic homeostasis being targeted by the exercise. Intriguingly, low-performing participants seemed to benefit more from the HIIT intervention suggesting it not only as a tool for basic research but also as a candidate for applications to boost memory performance in mental disorders or in the elderly.

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737670077612

The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737670077612
