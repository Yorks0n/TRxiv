However, most biomarkers today are based on measurements derived from bulk cell measurements, making it challenging to interpret whether an effect is due to changes in cell type composition (systemic factors) or a cell intrinsic effect. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a unique platform to simultaneously compare aging-associated changes on both a cellular and bulk level. We first generated a single-cell combined automated human blood cell type and age predictor (clock) for six distinct human T cell subsets. We applied these tools to find acute COVID is associated with a shift in CD8+ cytotoxic cell proportions, while cell type proportions are stable in patients with HIV on long-term ART treatment (HIV+ART). Both COVID and HIV+ART were associated with an increase in naive CD8 T cell transcriptomic age. We further found our single-cell aging biomarker is linked to ribosomal gene expression and has a link to mean cellular transcript length. This study highlights the potential of single cell transcriptomic biomarkers for understanding how the human immune system is impacted by age-associated systemic changes in cell type composition and intrinsic cellular aging.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303611

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the virus's origin. Results of investigations linked the index case to a mining cave inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus (the Egyptian fruit bat), where three individuals tested seropositive for IgG and IgM, further supporting the zoonotic origin of the outbreak through human-animal interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303611

Here, we report an antibody transport vehicle (ATV) targeting the transferrin receptor (TfR) for brain delivery of amyloid beta (A{beta}) antibodies that significantly reduced ARIA-like lesions and improved plaque target engagement in a mouse model of amyloid deposition. Asymmetrical Fc mutations (ATVcisLALA) allowed the molecule to selectively retain effector function only when bound to A{beta} while mitigating TfR-related hematology liabilities. Mice treated with ATVcisLALA:A{beta} exhibited broad brain parenchymal antibody distribution; in contrast, anti-A{beta} IgG was highly enriched at arterial perivascular spaces where vascular A{beta} localizes and likely plays a role in induction of ARIA. Importantly, ATVcisLALA: A{beta} almost completely eliminated ARIA-like lesions and vascular inflammation associated with anti-A{beta} treatment. Taken together, ATVcisLALA has the potential to significantly improve both safety and efficacy of A{beta} immunotherapy through enhanced biodistribution mediated by transport across the blood-brain barrier.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines.

Recently, a family of generative models called diffusion models has demonstrated the ability to generate biologically plausible proteins that are dissimilar to any actual proteins seen in nature, enabling unprecedented capability and control in de novo protein design. However, current state-of-the-art diffusion models generate protein structures, which limits the scope of their training data and restricts generations to a small and biased subset of protein design space. Here, we introduce a general-purpose diffusion framework, EvoDiff, that combines evolutionary-scale data with the distinct conditioning capabilities of diffusion models for controllable protein generation in sequence space. EvoDiff generates high-fidelity, diverse, and structurally-plausible proteins that cover natural sequence and functional space. We show experimentally that EvoDiff generations express, fold, and exhibit expected secondary structure elements. Critically, EvoDiff can generate proteins inaccessible to structure-based models, such as those with disordered regions, while maintaining the ability to design scaffolds for functional structural motifs. We validate the universality of our sequence-based formulation by experimentally characterizing intrinsically-disordered mitochondrial targeting signals, metal-binding proteins, and protein binders designed using EvoDiff. We envision that EvoDiff will expand capabilities in protein engineering beyond the structure-function paradigm toward programmable, sequence-first design.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

Here, we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TE function and evolution in AMF by investigating assembled genomes from representatives of all known families. We uncovered multiple, family-specific bursts of insertions in different species, indicating variable past and ongoing TE activity contributing to the diversification of AMF lineages. We also found that TEs are preferentially located within and around candidate effectors/secreted proteins, as well as in proximity to promoters. Altogether, these findings support the role of TEs in promoting the diversity in proteins involved in molecular dialogues with hosts and, more generally, in driving gene regulation.

However, it remains unclear how well traits explain variation in the outcomes of current and novel competition, as well as the underlying processes determining coexistence or competitive exclusion, under changing climate. Here, we conducted a field experiment in which pairs of high and low-elevation species interacted in three sites across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. For each species pair, we quantified the population-level outcomes of competition (invasion growth rates), relative fitness differences and niche overlap and related these to 15 functional traits that were measured in each site. Most traits were significantly associated with invasion growth rates at the low elevation, where species had greater relative fitness differences, but these associations were much weaker towards higher elevations. This appears to be because traits, particularly those associated with light competition, captured species relative fitness differences at lower elevations, but not at the high elevation site. Greater relative fitness differences towards lower elevations suggest that climate warming may increase the likelihood of competitive exclusion of species that are poor competitors for light. In addition, novel competitors tended to show greater niche overlap than current competitors, leading to stronger overall competitive effects. But in general, trait differences predicted competitive outcomes of novel and current competitors similarly well, suggesting that traits can be used to predict interactions between species that do not yet interact. Our study reinforces the importance of considering changing interactions for predicting species responses to climate change and provides experimental evidence supporting the usefulness of functional trait differences in forecasting the impacts of future plant interactions under changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

We used multiple Neuropixels probes to simultaneously record spiking activity from cortical and subcortical regions during a reaching task in head-fixed mice. Task-related population dynamics covaried within a common latent subspace across regions and was conserved across recording days and animals. These latent dynamics preceded movement onset and were modulated by reach distance and reward availability. Furthermore, their temporal progression continuously scaled with the timing of reward consumption and their activity decreased afterwards, despite ongoing stereotypical re-reaches. Our findings thus provide evidence for a brain-wide latent subspace for continuous representation of action-mediated proximity to goal, which could provide the basis for ubiquitous temporal difference learning based on predicted action outcome.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

Microtubule growth, shortening and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryo-electron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to a straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intra-cluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to form a straight microtubule lattice and accommodate new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is a key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundance. However, the vast number of distinct k-mers makes k-mer counting a significant resource bottleneck. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. To mitigate the excessive redundancy caused by overlapping k-mers, super-k-mers were introduced, significantly decreasing memory usage. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency. In this work, we introduce hyper-k-mers, a novel approach that further reduces redundancy. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new representation of k-mers that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 bits per nucleotide for super-k-mers to 4 bits per kmer. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm that leverages hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose resource usage does not scale linearly with the size of k and is the fastest option for large k-mer sizes. Our tool KFC is open-source under AGPL3 and available at https://github.com/lrobidou/KFC along with the experiments scripts at https://github.com/imartayan/KFC_experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

However, data on the type of antibiotics prescribed for such infections is only available for children <5 years in the UK. Understanding the contribution of RSV to antibiotic prescribing would facilitate predicting the impact of RSV preventative measures on antibiotic use and resistance. Objectives: To estimate the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions in English general practice attributable to RSV by age and antibiotic class. Methods: Generalised additive models examined associations between weekly counts of general practice antibiotic prescriptions and laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from 2015 to 2018, adjusting for temperature, practice holidays and remaining seasonal confounders. We used general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and microbiology tests for RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human Metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae from England's Second Generation Surveillance System. Results: An estimated 2.1% of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, equating to an average of 640,000 prescriptions annually. Of these, adults [&ge;]75 years contributed to the greatest volume, with an annual average of 149,078 (95% credible interval: 93,733-206,045). Infants 6-23 months had the highest average annual rate at 6,580 prescriptions per 100,000 individuals (95% credible interval: 4,522-8,651). Most RSV-attributable antibiotic prescriptions were penicillins, macrolides or tetracyclines. Adults [&ge;]65 years had a wider range of antibiotic classes associated with RSV compared to younger age groups. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in older adults, could complement current strategies to reduce antibiotic use in England.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303611

In mammals, DNA methylation is a biomarker for biological age, which may predict age more accurately than date of birth. However, limitations in mammalian models make it difficult to identify mechanisms underpinning age-related DNA methylation changes. Here, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, causing heterochromatin DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing lifespan, and that shoot apical meristems are protected from this aging process. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging, and that mutants of this mechanism display a complete absence of epigenetic decay. This presents a new paradigm in which a gene regulatory program sets the rate of epigenomic information loss during aging.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

These disparities are reported among migrants and black and ethnic minorities in Europe and North America. Lived experience perspectives from marginalised and multiple disadvantaged people are neglected in research yet may offer vital and novel insights into preventive opportunities to reduce coercive care

MethodsWe conducted a participatory photovoice research process to assemble the life- experiences of people within two years of receiving CAT. We purposively sampled to maximise diversity by age, ethnicity, and different  sections of the Mental Health Act (England & Wales, 1983, 2007) from 8 health systems in England. The images, captions, and reflective narratives were deepened over 3 workshops before thematic analysis.

OutcomesForty-eight ethnically diverse people with lived experience of CAT contributed over 500 images and 30 hours of transcribed narratives. Participants lives showed significant complexity in terms of multimorbidity, adverse childhood experiences, and carer roles. The findings suggest insufficient co-ordination to prevent CAT despite early help-seeking, not being taken seriously when seeking help, hostility and dismissive responses from professionals; unnecessary police involvement which was distressing, stigmatising, and risked criminalisation. Participants wanted more advocacy given their vulnerability and inability to process information in crisis, as well as therapeutic and creative activities in inpatient environments. Participants recommended more family and carer involvement, and more appropriate, frequent and personalised information about care options, appeals processes, levels of restriction, and seclusion. A major concern was the lack of highly skilled staff, trauma-informed care, and therapies into the community.

InterpretationWe showed epistemic injustice in care processes and recommend better standards for essential skills, prevention, trauma informed care and therapies. Criminalising and coercive responses must also be reduced.

Little is known about JCV pathogenesis, and no host factors required for cellular infection have been identified. Recently, we identified low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (Lrp1) as a host entry factor for two other bunyaviruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Oropouche virus (OROV). Here, we assessed the role of Lrp1 in mediating JCV cellular infection of neurons. Both neuronal and non-neuronal immortalized cell lines deficient for Lrp1 displayed reduction in infection with JCV, and early stages of infection such as binding and internalization were impacted by lack of Lrp1. In primary rat neurons, Lrp1 was highly expressed, and the neurons were highly permissive for JCV infection. Treatment of primary neurons with recombinant receptor-associated protein (RAP), a high affinity ligand for Lrp1, resulted in reduced infectivity with JCV. In addition, pretreatment of cells with RVFV Gn inhibited JCV infection, suggesting that the two viruses may share overlapping binding sites. These results provide compelling evidence that Lrp1 is an important cellular factor for efficient infection by JCV, and thus multiple bunyaviruses with varying clinical manifestations and tissue tropism are facilitated by the host cell Lrp1. Reliance of multiple bunyaviruses on Lrp1 makes it a promising target for pan-bunyaviral antivirals and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303611

Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

Failure of this process, in compromised mitochondria, leads to kinase activation at the surface, and ultimately mitophagy. Analysis of PINK1-import within intact cells reveals an alternative pathway into the matrix. Structural modelling predicts that the trans-membrane-domain (TMD) of PINK1 forms either an alpha-helix or alpha/beta-hybrid at the interface between Tim17, of the TIM23-core-complex, and, respectively, either Romo1 or PARL. These mutually exclusive interactions both encapsulate a hydrated protein-channel. The alpha-helical-TMD form adopts a pose suggestive of translocation through the Romo1/Tim17-channel, while the alpha/beta-hybrid-TMD is retracted into the PARL active-site for cleavage, presumably after import through the adjacent rhomboid/Tim17-channel.

Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red [-&gt;] green [-&gt;] blue [-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

Our studies in humanized mice and non-human primates (NHPs) demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) modified with anti-HIV CAR leads to lifelong engraftment and supply of functional anti-viral CAR-T cells, leading to significantly reduced viral rebound after ART withdrawal. However, T cell exhaustion, driven by chronic immune activation, remains a major challenge for the continuous efficacy of CAR-T therapy, necessitating additional measures to achieve functional cure. We recently showed that in vivo treatment with low dose rapamycin reduced chronic inflammation and improved anti-HIV T cell function in HIV-infected humanized mice. Here, we report that rapamycin significantly improved CAR-T cell function both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with rapamycin improved CAR-T cell mitochondria respiration and cytotoxicity. In vivo treatment with low-dose rapamycin in HIV-infected, CAR-HSC treated mice reduced chronic inflammation, prevented exhaustion of CAR-T cells and improved CAR-T control of viral replication compared to CAR-HSCs treatment alone. RNAseq analysis of sorted CAR-T cells from humanized mice showed that rapamycin significantly modified the CAR-T cell transcriptome, including the downregulation of multiple check point inhibitors and the upregulation of key genes related to cell survival. We also observed significantly delayed viral rebound after ART withdrawal and diminished HIV reservoir in mice that were treated with rapamycin and CAR-HSCs as compared to CAR-HSCs treatment alone. Taken together, our data indicate that HSCs-based anti-HIV CAR-T combined with rapamycin treatment is a promising approach for treating persistent inflammation and improving immune control of HIV replication.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

We approached organization by profiling the activity and spatial location of >23,000 neurons recorded in awake mice. Regularly firing neurons were over-represented in most PFC subregions, yet a fine-grained activity map of the PFC did not align with cytoarchitecturally defined subregions. Instead, we observed a robust relationship between spontaneous activity patterns and intra-PFC hierarchy, suggesting internal organization principles transcending cytoarchitecture. Single neuron responses to sounds did not reflect intra-PFC hierarchy but were linked to spontaneous firing rate, indicating that responsiveness increases with excitability and is decoupled from the PFC's intrinsic operational structure. Our data-driven approach provides a scalable roadmap to explore functional organizations in diverse brain regions and species, opening avenues to link activity, structure, and function in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303611

The TGN disintegration resulted from its acute deacidification caused by disassembly of the Golgi V-ATPase. Mechanistically, Sac1 mediated TGN membrane composition maintained an assembly promoting conformation of the V0a2 subunit. Key phenotypes of acute Sac1 degradation were recapitulated in human differentiated trophoblasts, causing processing defects of chorionic gonadotropin, in line with loss-of-function intolerance of the human SACML1 gene.

However, deriving specific phenotypes from MRI data requires time-consuming expert annotation, limiting scalability and does not exploit how information dense such image acquisitions are. In this study, we applied a 3D diffusion autoencoder to temporally resolved cardiac MRI data from 71,021 UK Biobank participants to derive latent phenotypes representing the human heart in motion. These phenotypes were reproducible, heritable (h2 = [4 - 18%]), and significantly associated with cardiometabolic traits and outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (P = 8.5 x 10-29) and myocardial infarction (P = 3.7 x 10-12). By using latent space manipulation techniques, we directly interpreted and visualised what specific latent phenotypes were capturing in a given MRI. To establish the genetic basis of such traits, we performed a genome-wide association study, identifying 89 significant common variants (P < 2.3 x 10-9) across 42 loci, including seven novel loci. Extensive multi-trait colocalisation analyses (PP.H4 > 0.8) linked these variants to various cardiac traits and diseases, revealing a shared genetic architecture spanning phenotypic scales. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) derived from latent phenotypes demonstrated predictive power for a range of cardiometabolic diseases and high risk individuals had substantially increased cumulative hazard rates across a range of diseases.

Abscisic acid (ABA) signalling has long been recognized as a key positive regulator of this process, coordinating the expression of genes that drive the acquisition of vital seed quality traits (SQTs) crucial for survival, resilience, and storage. However, the precise molecular regulation of many SQTs remains elusive. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive transcriptome analysis of seed maturation in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on Col-0 wild-type and ten mutant lines affecting ABA biosynthesis, signaling, and catabolism from 12 days after pollination up to the dry seed stage. Our study employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and module-trait correlation to uncover specific gene groups linked to the regulation of multiple SQTs. We identified Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) genes uniquely associated with desiccation tolerance and three DREB AND EAR MOTIF PROTEIN (DEAR) transcription factors involved in seed longevity regulation. The value of our dataset lies not only in its depth and detail, but also in its integration into SeedMatExplorer, a web tool specifically designed to advance seed maturation research. SeedMatExplorer serves as a unique resource, enabling researchers to explore, visualize, and generate new hypotheses about gene expression regulation during seed maturation and the intricate control of SQTs. This physiological and transcriptomic atlas offers unprecedented insights into the complex, coordinated gene expression that drives SQT acquisition in Arabidopsis seeds, making it an invaluable asset for the scientific community.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Here, we study the use of exometabolites as biomarkers for the viral shunt by applying molecular, metabolomics, and oceanographic tools in blooms of the cosmopolitan microalga Gephyrocapsa huxleyi across the Atlantic Ocean, spanning four biogeochemical provinces between Iceland and Patagonia. We mapped the distinct metabolic footprint of its viral infections using exo- and endometabolomics approaches and detected nineteen organohalogen metabolites across the blooms, showing their global formation. Time-resolved comparison of particulate and dissolved metabolite pools during an induced mesocosm bloom indicated virocells - actively infected host cells - as the source of the halogenated metabolites. Three trichloro-iodo metabolites were present during demise of all virus-infected blooms, highlighting them as suitable metabolic biomarkers. The environmental stability of these halometabolites in the DOM pool over a few days can recapitulate viral infections at earlier stages of phytoplankton bloom succession.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Clinical data from patient records were used to calculate a Symptom Score, and screening tools for stress/PTSD (PCL-5), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (SWL) were employed to evaluate if Long COVID duration and severity could predict neuropsychiatric outcomes. The majority were female (71%) and Hispanic (53%) who presented for treatment of Long COVID symptoms during the study period, including fatigue (93%), coughing/shortness of breath (81%), fever (67%), anosmia (58%), ageusia (54%), and weight loss (56%). There was a high burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including subjective cognitive impairment (79%), headache (74%), and insomnia (58%). Symptom Score (median = 9, IQR [8,11]) was significantly correlated with increased depression (PHQ-9; p < 0.05), anxiety (GAD-7; p < 0.05) and elevated stress/PTSD (PCL-5; p < 0.05) symptoms.

Importantly, duration of Long COVID symptomatology also did not predict PCL-5 scores. No patient factors (e.g., sex, age, BMI, ethnicity) mediated Symptom Score. Nonetheless, historically marginalized groups, such as women and Hispanics, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

Through comprehensive analysis of randomly sampled datasets with varying ancestral compositions, we demonstrate that genetic diversity, rather than sample size alone, drives the performance of intolerance metrics in identifying functionally critical genes and genic sub-regions. Notably, scores trained on variation observed in African and Admixed American ancestral groups showed superior resolution in detecting neurodevelopmental disease risk genes and haploinsufficient genes compared to scores trained on variation observed in European ancestry cohorts. Most strikingly, the Missense Tolerance Ratio (MTR) trained on 43,000 multi-ancestry exomes demonstrated greater predictive power than when trained on a nearly 10-fold larger dataset of 440,000 non-Finnish European exomes, indicating that European ancestry-based scores are approaching saturation.

Rats, like humans, show individual differences in their tendency to engage in and maintain control over coping behaviours. While most rats exposed to a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) procedure develop a controlled coping response, namely polydipsic drinking, some engage in excessive, compulsive drinking, or hyperdipsia. The development of hyperdipsia, to which highly impulsive rats are particularly vulnerable, depends on noradrenergic mechanisms, as it is prevented by the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine. However, whether noradrenergic mechanisms also underlie the maintenance of hyperdipsia, or if other traits confer vulnerability to its development, are unknown. In two longitudinal studies in male Sprague Dawley rats, we investigated whether well-established hyperdipsia is influenced by atomoxetine and if its development is predicted by the ICSD-relevant sign-tracking trait. Sign-tracking predicted faster acquisition of adjunctive drinking but not the transition to hyperdipsia, while goal-tracking protected against the latter. Surprisingly, chronic atomoxetine exacerbated well-established hyperdipsia; post-mortem qPCR assays revealed that this was associated with increased cFos and Zif268 mRNA, markers of cellular activity and plasticity, across the dorsal striatum. Atomoxetine also altered the hyperdipsia-specific transcriptomic landscape of the nucleus accumbens shell and the pattern of cFos and Zif268 expression in the amygdalo-striatal system. These results provide new insights into the biobehavioural basis of compulsive behaviours, revealing a differential noradrenergic control of the development and the expression of compulsive coping.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Clusters can facilitate transcription, but it remains unclear how they form. It has been suggested that clusters are seeded by the sequence-specific binding of TFs to DNA, and grow by IDR-IDR interactions that bring in more TFs. This model, however, does not explain how TFs can cluster in specific combinations. Here, we study TF clustering by quantitative imaging of Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b in zebrafish embryos. Using mutant and chimaeric TFs, we show that the formation of a TF cluster requires the DBD as well as at least one of its IDRs. In contrast with the existing model, however, IDRs are not sufficient to join a pre-existing cluster. Instead, both IDR and DBD are needed. Thus, for any TF to join a cluster, motif recognition is required, which explains the specificity in cluster formation. Finally, we show that while IDRs are required to join a cluster, their amino acid sequence is interchangeable, and the DBD can confer specificity to any IDR. Taken together, our work changes the model of cluster formation and explains how specificity is achieved in the organization of transcriptional machinery in the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

By implementing ribosomal elongation-inhibited cell isolation and switching to RNase I ribonuclease for generating ribosomal footprints, we expand the applicability of single-cell ribosome profiling to in vivo systems and facilitate the evaluation of triplet periodicity, a hallmark of high-quality ribosome profiling data. Leveraging this strategy and integrating ribosome profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing, we document the in vivo translational landscapes of the major epidermal cell types, outline cell-type-specific translational efficiencies and capture heterogeneity in differentiation commitment within stem cell populations. Notably, we identify a pronounced translational reprogramming of AP-1 subunits specifically in aged epidermal stem cells, with functional consequences for keratinocyte behavior. Our study illustrates the power of in vivo single-cell ribosome profiling to map cell-type-specific translational programs and offers a scalable strategy for tissue-wide interrogation of translational landscapes at single-cell resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

CTCF repositions nucleosomes asymmetrically, with linker spacing altered by accessibility, while cohesin-mediated nucleosome phasing is affected by surrounding motifs which also impact chromatin insulation. Importantly, cell type-specific transcriptional programs determine motif enrichment at CTCF bound sites, reflecting the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of individual TFs.

Due to the vast combinatorial complexity of multi-gene regulation, we introduce a machine learning-based computational algorithm that uses single-cell RNA sequencing data to predict multi-gene perturbation sets for converting a starting cell type into a desired target cell type.

Recent work has shown that ketone bodies such as {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}-OHB), which are elevated in circulation under fasting conditions or low glycemic diets, can serve as an alternative fuel that is metabolized in the mitochondria to provide acetyl-CoA for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in some tumors4-7. Here, we discover a non-canonical route for {beta}-OHB metabolism, in which {beta}-OHB can bypass the TCA cycle to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA for de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells. We show that {beta}-OHB-derived acetoacetate in the mitochondria can be shunted into the cytosol, where acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) and thiolase convert it into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. This alternative metabolic routing of {beta}-OHB allows it to avoid oxidation in the mitochondria and net contribute to anabolic biosynthetic processes. In cancer cells, {beta}-OHB is used for fatty acid synthesis to support cell proliferation under lipid-limited conditions in vitro and contributes to tumor growth under lipid-limited conditions induced by a calorie-restricted diet in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate that {beta}-OHB is preferentially used for fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells to support tumor growth.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

This allowed us to manipulate neuronal lysosome distribution including in axons and interrogate its contribution to both optimal neuronal functioning and to disease pathology. We demonstrate that the small molecule not only rescues aberrant buildup of both axonal autophagic and lysosomal intermediates but also reduces secreted Abeta42 levels in human iPSC-derived neurons lacking the lysosomal adaptor, JIP3. We thus demonstrate that restoring efficient axonal lysosome transport has an anti-amyloidogenic effect in human neurons and is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, we show that the small molecule enhances neuronal lysosome degradation, requires the lysosomal adaptor JIP4 to rescue the axonal lysosome pathology in the JIP3 KO neurons and increases levels of the JIP4-interacting lysosomal membrane protein, TMEM55B. Lastly, treatment with the small molecule led to a striking rescue of locomotor defects in JIP3 KO zebrafish larvae.

A major thrust of current HD therapeutic development is lowering levels of mutant HTT mRNA (mHTT) and protein (mHTT) with the aim of reducing the toxicity of these product(s). Human genetic data also support a key role for somatic instability (SI) in HTT's CAG repeat -- whereby it lengthens with age in specific somatic cell types -- as a key driver of age of motor dysfunction onset. Thus, an attractive HD therapy would address both mHTT toxicity and SI, but to date the relationship between SI and HTT lowering remains unexplored. Here, we investigated multiple therapeutically-relevant HTT-lowering modalities to establish the relationship between HTT lowering and SI in HD knock-in mice. We find that repressing transcription of mutant Htt (mHtt) provides robust protection from SI, using diverse genetic and pharmacological approaches (antisense oligonucleotides, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, the Lac repressor, and virally delivered zinc finger transcriptional repressor proteins, ZFPs). However, we find that small interfering RNA (siRNA), a potent HTT-lowering treatment, lowers HTT levels without influencing SI and that SI is also normal in mice lacking 50% of total HTT levels, suggesting HTT levels, per se, do not modulate SI in trans. Remarkably, modified ZFPs that bind the mHtt locus, but lack a repressive domain, robustly protect from SI, despite not reducing HTT mRNA or protein levels. These results have important therapeutic implications in HD, as they suggest that DNA-targeted HTT-lowering treatments may have significant advantages compared to other HTT-lowering approaches, and that interaction of a DNA-binding protein and HTT's CAG repeats may provide protection from SI while sparing HTT expression.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Although its effectiveness has been estimated to range between 36-86%, the persistence of protection is still unknown.

Aims of this study is to assess the immune response one year after vaccination with MVA-BN.

MethodsObservational prospective study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. All people at high risk for mpox infection who received MVA-BN as pre-exposure prophylaxis were enrolled. People previously primed with smallpox vaccination received a single-dose course of MVA-BN, while non-primed received a two-dose course. Blood samples were collected at the time of each dose and one, six and 12 months after vaccination. MPXV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed by immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization tests, respectively. Interferon-{gamma} producing T-cell specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine was analyzed by ELISpot assay. Antibody titers at pre- and post-vaccination were compared using the Friedman tests. Mann Whitney test was used to compare antibody titers in PLWH vs PLWoH. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare T-cells specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine for intra and inter-group differences, respectively.

ResultsFifty high-risk people were included. All were men, with 94% self-reporting having sex with men. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-57), and 21 (42%) were people living with HIV (PLWH), all on antiretroviral therapy, and 71% with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 L. 25 (50%) have been primed with previous smallpox vaccination.

In non-primed people, anti-MPXV IgG titers significantly increased from T1 to T3 and, despite a slight reduction, were still higher than T1 up to T4 and then gradually decreased until T5, when 64% of sera were still reactive. MPXV-nAb titers peaked at T3 and then dropped, with 56% and 32% of sera reactive at T4 and T5, respectively. IFN-{gamma} production by MVA-BN-specific T-cells progressively rose across time, peaked at T3, and remained significantly higher than the baseline after 6 and 12 months from vaccination. A single-dose course of MVA-BN vaccination in smallpox-primed participants elicited an early increase in IgG and nAb titers, which remained significantly higher than baseline after 6 and 12 months. MPXV-nAbs were detected in 80% and 72% of vaccinees at T4 and T5, respectively. A similar improvement and maintenance were observed for the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response. No evidence for a difference in both humoral and cellular responses was found between PLWH and PLWoH in our cohort.

ConclusionsOne year after vaccination, our data showed the persistent detectability of low levels of nAb against MPXV in one-third of non-primed individuals. At the same time, humoral response was still detectable in most previously vaccinated participants. Concurrently, the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response was robust and persistent.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303612

It is caused by the monkeypox virus, which is endemic to some countries of West and Central Africa. A multi-country outbreak of mpox occurred in 2022, and the UK experienced rapid community transmission associated with sexual contact, mainly, but not exclusively among networks of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). In response to the outbreak in the UK, a reactive mpox vaccination programme was targeted to those most at risk. We explore the uptake and course completion of mpox vaccination in GBMSM taking part in an online survey in 2023. Findings from this community sample indicate vaccination uptake in around two-thirds of participants meeting mpox proxy eligibility criteria with high levels of course completion among all and eligible participants that were ever vaccinated. Vaccine non-offer was a barrier to uptake, as nearly a third of those eligible but unvaccinated reported never having received an mpox vaccine offer. Continued targeting of vaccination to GBMSM at highest risk of mpox at SHS, with community-support, will help facilitate equitable uptake of vaccination.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303612

Holding isometric muscle actions (HIMA) are largely unknown, although practitioners prescribe them in rehabilitation and performance contexts. The lack of knowledge and consensus in research on the distinction between two isometric types and limited scientific backing makes appropriate use in clinical and performance contexts difficult. Objective: To gather research directly comparing PIMA and HIMA, and to summarize and synthesize findings. We also aimed to identify potential practical applications for both tasks. Lastly, we highlight existing gaps in the literature and propose directions for future research. Methods: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles comparing PIMA and HIMA in humans. Risk-of-bias and study quality were assessed via established assessments for quasi-experimental studies and funnel plots, respectively. Findings were synthesized where possible, with meta-analyses and meta-regressions performed on time-to-task-failure (TTF), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Results: Fifty-four studies (publication year = 2012.9 {+/-} 6.9; 1995-2024) were identified (N=856 participants; ~29.5 {+/-} 10.1 years). Thirty-five included performance parameters (e.g., TTF), 45 examined neurological outputs (e.g., electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography), and 14 explored cardiovascular or metabolic (e.g., glucose uptake, oxygenation) variables. Meta-analysis of 23 studies revealed consistently longer TTF for PIMA vs HIMA at the same absolute intensity (n = 407; g = -0.74, p < 0.001), except for two studies examining axial muscles (g = 1.78-3.59, p < 0.001). Meta-analyses of 6-11 studies detected no absolute differences in HR, MAP, or RPE (n = 136-194; g = -0.11 to 0.18, p = 0.07-0.96), except for RPE at 50% of TTF being greater during PIMA (n = 164; g = -0.31, p = 0.01). PIMA mostly showed higher force fluctuations, discharge rates, D1-inhibition and peak torque, while HIMA indicated higher heteronymous facilitation, EMG burst rates, interspike interval variation, muscular glucose uptake, and faster increases in force/position fluctuations, EMG amplitude, RPE, HR, and MAP. Findings on muscle activation were mixed. HIMAs showed fewer neurological alterations during experimental joint pain. Conclusions: Evidence suggests distinguishing two types of isometric muscle action indicating more complex control strategies for HIMA than PIMA. Findings revealed similarities to anisometric actions, suggesting that the control strategies of HIMA and PIMA resemble the ones for muscle lengthening and shortening, respectively. HIMAs could provide a time-efficient approach for inducing musculoskeletal, neural, and cardiovascular adaptations in rehabilitation. PIMA may be beneficial for prolonged activation and agonist neuromuscular adaptations. Methods varied widely across studies, making additional meta-analyses impossible. More consistent methodology and data reporting are recommended. Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the use of PIMA vs HIMA in clinical or performance contexts. The knowledge of both isometric types should be implemented in research and education. Registration: The original protocol was prospectively registered at the National Institute of Health Research PROSPERO (CRD42024530386).","NA","medrxiv",1731017303612

The potential for the exploration of individual gene functions in this valuable plant is demonstrated by an analysis of the flavonoid biosynthesis genes and their transcriptional regulators. Important players of the flavonol biosynthesis, including structural genes and a transcription factor, were identified that are required to produce precursors of phytomedically relevant flavonol glycosides.

DNA polymerase beta (Pol {beta}) is the primary enzyme responsible for processing the 1-nt gap intermediate in chromatin during SSBR and BER. However, the mechanism used by Pol {beta} to process a 1-nt gap in the context of the nucleosome and chromatin remains poorly understood. Here, we use biochemical assays and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the kinetic and structural basis of gap-filling DNA synthesis in the nucleosome by Pol {beta}. Kinetic analysis identified that gap-filling DNA synthesis in the nucleosome by Pol {beta} is position-dependent, where solvent exposed 1-nt gaps are processed more efficiently than histone-occluded 1-nt gaps. A series of cryo-EM structures of Pol {beta} bound to a solvent-exposed 1-nt gap in the nucleosome reveal a global DNA sculpting mechanism for 1-nt gap recognition, which is mediated by sequential engagement of the Pol {beta} lyase domain and polymerase domain. Finally, cryo-EM structures of Pol {beta} bound to 1-nt gaps at two additional positions in the nucleosomal DNA define the structural basis for position-dependent nucleotide insertion in the nucleosome. This work establishes the mechanism used by Pol {beta} for processing 1-nt gaps in the nucleosome during SSBR and BER, providing fundamental insight into DNA repair in chromatin.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Inspired by previous work on an association between genetic evidence and clinical success, we used retrospective analysis of known drug target genes to identify potential predictors of target clinical success from scRNA-seq data. We investigated whether successful drug targets are associated with cell type specific expression in a disease-relevant tissue (cell type specificity), and with cell type specific over-expression in disease patients compared to healthy controls (disease cell specificity). Analysing scRNA-seq data across diseases and tissues, we found that both cell type and disease cell specificity are features enriched in targets entering clinical development, and that cell type specificity in the disease-relevant tissue is robustly predictive of target progression from Phase I to II. While scRNA-seq analysis identifies a larger and complementary target space to that of direct genetic evidence, its association with specificity and drug approval appears less clear. We discuss how further expansion and harmonization of single-cell datasets, more sophisticated integration of this data in target discovery, and improved methods for tracking clinical trial outcomes could enhance our ability to leverage scRNA-seq insights in drug development in future.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303612

In plants, such regulation is critical for flower formation, which involves the progressive differentiation of stem cell populations within floral meristems followed by rapid sequential development of floral organs. Across plant taxa, these transitions are orchestrated by the F-box transcriptional co-factor gene UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO). The conserved and pleiotropic functions of UFO offer a useful framework for investigating how evolutionary processes have shaped the intricate cis-regulation of key developmental genes. By pinpointing a conserved promoter sequence in an accessible chromatin region of the tomato ortholog of UFO, we engineered in vivo a series of cis-regulatory alleles that caused both loss- and gain-of-function floral defects. These mutant phenotypes were linked to disruptions in predicted transcription factor binding sites for known transcriptional activators and repressors. Allelic combinations revealed dosage-dependent interactions between opposing alleles, influencing the penetrance and expressivity of gain-of-function phenotypes. These phenotypic differences support that robustness in tomato flower development requires precise temporal control of UFO expression dosage. Bridging our analysis to Arabidopsis, we found that although homologous sequences to the tomato regulatory region are dispersed within the UFO promoter, they maintain similar control over floral development. However, phenotypes from disrupting these sequences differ due to the differing expression patterns of UFO. Our study underscores the complex cis-regulatory control of dynamic developmental genes and demonstrates that critical short stretches of regulatory sequences that recruit both activating and repressing machinery are conserved to maintain developmental robustness.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

Here, we investigated humoral recall responses and vaccine-mediated protection in Syrian hamsters immunized with the third-generation Comirnaty(R) Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, followed by infection with either antigenically closely (EG.5.1) or distantly related (JN.1) Omicron subvariants. Vaccination with YF17D vector encoding a modified Gamma spike (YF-S0*) served as a control for pre-Omicron SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Our results show that both Comirnaty(R) XBB.1.5 and YF-S0* induce robust, however, poorly cross-reactive, neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses. In either case, total antibody and nAb levels increased following infection. Intriguingly, the specificity of these boosted nAbs did not match the respective challenge virus but was skewed towards the primary antigen used for immunization, suggesting a marked impact of antigenic imprinting; confirmed by antigenic cartography. Furthermore, limited cross-reactivity and rapid decline of nAbs induced by Comirnaty(R) XBB.1.5 with EG.5.1 and, more concerning, JN.1. raises doubts about sustained vaccine efficacy against recent circulating Omicron subvariants.

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.
C_LIO_LIA reference database containing all the known genome sizes, built from the NCBI databases, with associated taxa, provided in an archive to download.
C_LIO_LIA taxonomic tree structure as built by the NCBI, provided in the same archive.

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303612

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

We show that uniaxial compression induces clonal multicellularity in haloarchaea, forming tissue-like structures. These archaeal tissues are mechanically and molecularly distinct from their unicellular lifestyle, mimicking several eukaryotic features. Notably, archaeal tissues undergo a coenocytic stage followed by a tubulin-independent cellularization, orchestrated by active membrane tension at a critical cell size. Past cellularization, tissues are organized into two cell types apical and basal scutoids - with junction elasticity akin to animal tissues, with actin and protein glycosylation as fiducial polarity markers. Our findings highlight the remarkable biophysical potential of convergent evolution in the emergence of multicellular systems across domains of life.","NA","biorxiv",1731017303612

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1731017303612
