ObjectiveTo assess the transportability of findings from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to real-world populations in the United States (US), Germany and France.

DesignThis empirical validation study used patient-level data from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to build a transportability model to adjust for differences in patient characteristics from real-world target patient populations. Two sets of adjustments were performed - one limited to the set of measured clinical variables, and the second additionally including external information drawn from published literature and substantive knowledge on patient subgroups excluded from the trial. The latter enabled transportability to a significantly more diverse and representative real-world patient population by relaxing the stringent exclusion criteria used in Lung-MAP S1400I. For benchmarking, we compared how well the transportability analysis approximated observed overall survival in the respective real-world cohorts.

SettingObservational study.

ParticipantsEligible individuals diagnosed with advanced or metastatic NSCLC and previously treated with systemic therapy.

Intervention/exposureNivolumab monotherapy.

Main outcome measuresOverall survival.

ResultsSample size for the nivolumab arm in Lung-MAP S1400I was 127 and ranged from 133 to 1051 for the various real-world cohorts included. Patients with ECOG scores of 2+, index cancer stage <IV, presence of ALK/EGFR mutations, presence of comorbidities and prior exposure to immunotherapy/targeted therapies were excluded from Lung-MAP S1400I, were but were eligible to receive nivolumab monotherapy in real-world care. Adjusting for measured clinical differences improved alignment of patient outcomes in the RCT and the real-world cohorts. However, only when variables related to excluded patient groups were also addressed did the results fully satisfy control conditions, yielding the closest approximation to real-world survival in the US, Germany, and France (mean discrepancy: 0.27 months over [~]30 months).

ConclusionsOverall survival in a more diverse real-world patient population could be extrapolated using data from the Lung-MAP S1400I trial when complemented with external information about excluded patient groups.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

We investigated how the body and brain gather informative sensory signals from a wearable augmentation interface (a robotic digit for motor augmentation), and whether naturally-mediated feedback can support technological embodiment.

Participants intuitively interpreted natural feedback across perceptual tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art artificial feedback systems. fMRI revealed an immediate and distinct, topographically-organised representation of the robotic digit. After longitudinal training, this representation was further refined, becoming more similar to the biological digits, which correlated with increased subjective somatosensory embodiment.

Our findings demonstrate that wearable devices naturally provide a powerful source of feedback which is immediately integrated with our body. Long-term use can then promote device-embodiment across the sensorimotor hierarchy.","NA","biorxiv",1750457361630

Methods The study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort. Results Analysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses. Conclusion The results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines.","NA","biorxiv",1750457361630

Previous structural studies have advanced our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein architecture and function, however, the lack of high-resolution in situ structures of the glycoprotein tetramer and its lattice organization has limited mechanistic insights into viral assembly, entry, and antigenicity. Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 A resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein assemblies and their function, laying a foundation for structure-based vaccine design efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1750457361630

MethodsWe conducted a national retrospective database study including children born in 2008-2020. Individual-level data-linkage allowed examination of associations of sociodemographic variables with MMR and DTaP-IPV vaccination status at 2 years of age. Coverage for each variable, stratified by birth cohort, was calculated. Multivariable Poisson regression assessed independent associations and changes in coverage over time.

ResultsMMR coverage decreased in all population subgroups (overall 95% to 89% in 2008 and 2020 cohorts), with more substantial declines in some groups. The multivariable analysis showed that Dutch children of non-Dutch origin, particularly those of Moroccan and Turkish origin showed more pronounced declines (-25% and -12% compared to children of Dutch origin in cohort 2020, respectively). Among children not attending day care and children living in larger families ([&ge;]4 children), a faster decline in coverage was observed compared to those attending day care and living in smaller families (both -12% in cohort 2020). Among children of self-employed mothers and children in the lowest income households, lower coverage was observed compared to children of mothers in employment and children in the highest income households (-8% and -7% in cohort 2020, respectively). Nearly identical trends were observed for DTaP-IPV vaccination.

ConclusionOur study reveals a significant decline in childhood vaccination coverage in the Netherlands, with increasing disparities between sociodemographic groups. This is crucial for prioritising vaccination efforts to protect public health equitably.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.","NA","biorxiv",1750457361630

For this reason, the genetic profiles of Genghis Khan and his descendants are of keen academic and public interest. His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population. Furthermore, we were able to identify their medieval relatives in the Mongolian Plateau through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network.","NA","biorxiv",1750457361630

Panic disorder, diagnosed in 2- 4%3, involves recurrent attacks followed by persistent worry about further attacks, leading to functional impairment and avoidance behaviours1,2. We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses of panic attacks and panic disorder (61,746 and 29,775 cases, respectively, and 105,814 controls), identifying the first genome-wide significant variants for both traits (16 for panic attacks; 7 for panic disorder). Geneset analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing data implicated afferent neurons from the eye, heart, and lung in panic attacks, suggesting a critical role for sensory processing and interoceptive awareness. Further analyses suggested that these associations generalize to other psychiatric disorders. These findings offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying panic, the role of afferent neurons, and may inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

DNA methylation (DNAm) is an epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in gene regulation and has been implicated in both aging and AD. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of DNAm profiles in the prefrontal cortex using two large, independent postmortem brain cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) and Brains for Dementia Research (BDR), to identify DNAm differences associated with aging in late life.

We identified 3,264 CpGs significantly associated with aging, the majority of which were hypermethylated and enriched in promoter regions and CpG islands. These aging-associated DNAm changes were significantly overrepresented in genes involved in immune regulation and metabolic pathways. When compared with AD-associated DNAm changes, we found a significant overlap, with nearly all CpGs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were associated with both aging and AD Braak stage displaying concordant directionality. This supports the hypothesis that aging and AD are interconnected at the molecular level.

Further integrative analyses indicated that a number of these DNAm variants may have functional relevance in AD. By integrating blood DNAm data, we identified multiple CpGs that showed significant brain-to-blood correlations and were involved in both aging and AD pathogenesis. Co-localization analyses with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data revealed shared genetic regulation of DNAm and dementia at several AD risk loci. Out-of-sample validation using the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrated that, among 334 CpGs showing concordant DNAm changes in aging and AD, baseline DNAm levels at cg10752406 in the AZU1 promoter were significantly associated with AD progression at a 5% false discovery rate, even after adjusting for age, sex, APOE {varepsilon}4 allele status, years of education, and baseline MMSE. Notably, this CpG also showed a strong brain-blood DNAm correlation, further supporting its potential as a peripheral biomarker for AD. Our study provides valuable insights into the epigenetic landscape of aging and its implications for AD, suggesting that aging-related epigenetic modifications may provide a viable source of biomarkers for AD.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

Using high-dimensional flow cytometry and machine learning, we comprehensively assessed the cellular component of the peripheral immune system in a well-characterised cohort of 184 Alzheimers patients and 105 healthy spouses. Using this approach, Alzheimers patients demonstrated a disturbance in B cell maturation, a feature which was associated not only with disease status but also with cognitive decline.

The effort to enroll a large population of prodromal individuals (participants with PD biomarkers and/or early symptoms) presents an opportunity to share insights for overcoming specific challenges unique to enrollment prior to the onset of typical symptoms.

MethodsPaid and earned media, referral cohorts, and individual and community ambassadors were leveraged as recruitment strategies to attract and enroll a broad study population. The success of each strategy was measured as conversion to (i) informed consent, (ii) smell test completion, and (iii) identification of hyposmic individuals. Participants completed an eConsent and questionnaire online, followed by remote smell test screening for Parkinsons risk. Participants with hyposmia were invited to complete dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging. Those who continued to meet eligibility criteria were invited to enroll in the PPMI clinical study, for comprehensive longitudinal follow-up.

ResultsOver 1.2 million visits to the smell test website were recorded and 79,837 participants consented to remote hyposmia screening. A smell test was sent to 57,754 participants and completed by 38,419; 6,649 were identified to be hyposmic (as defined by PPMI study cutoffs). DAT imaging was completed by 1,720, with 1,120 identified as eligible for longitudinal follow-up. The greatest number of participants who consented to smell testing came from paid media and social media ads, referral networks (commercial and study partners), and the MJFF community. Overall, 14.4% of participants who completed smell testing were confirmed to be hyposmic. The highest rates of conversion from completed UPSIT to confirmed case of hyposmia occurred with promoted online search results, earned press coverage, and radio ads.

ConclusionPPMI provides a useful example of overcoming challenges to enrollment of participants with biomarkers and/or early symptoms (but without typical symptoms) of disease. Important lessons from these data for this study team, and other researchers alike, are to be agile in recruitment strategies, to utilize effective participant engagement approaches, and to prioritize centralized study teams/resources to offload site burden and streamline participant experience.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

In this study, we investigated time-resolved changes in cortical E/I balance and their network-level and structural correlates in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. High-density EEG recordings encompassing at least one recorded seizure were obtained from pre-surgical evaluations. Using source-reconstructed EEG, we tracked dynamic changes in the aperiodic exponent of the power spectrum--a non-invasive proxy for E/I balance--during preictal and interictal periods. Directed functional connectivity was assessed using spectral Granger causality, and correlations with cortical thickness and neurotransmitter receptor density were evaluated. We found that the aperiodic exponent increased progressively in the minutes preceding seizures, reflecting a widespread shift toward cortical inhibition. This pattern was specific to the preictal state and evident across both epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic regions. Periodic activity in delta and theta bands also increased prior to seizures, supporting a global reorganization of cortical excitability. At the functional profile level, epileptogenic regions demonstrated significantly greater outward connectivity than both their inward connectivity and that of non-epileptogenic areas during the preictal phase. Moreover, E/I balance was differentially related to connectivity patterns: non-epileptogenic regions showed a positive correlation between inhibition (higher aperiodic exponent) and outward connectivity, whereas epileptogenic regions displayed a trend toward the opposite pattern. Structure-function coupling also diverged: cortical thickness positively correlated with inhibitory tone in non-epileptogenic regions but not in epileptogenic ones. Finally, we observed that lower values of muscarinic receptor density corresponded to an E/I balance shifted towards inhibition (ie., higher aperiodic exponent), linking cholinergic tone with preictal E/I dynamics. These findings indicate that seizure onset is preceded by a shift toward inhibition at the whole-brain level, accompanied by distinct patterns of directed connectivity and disrupted structural coupling in epileptogenic networks. This multiscale perspective highlights the interplay between electrophysiology, network topology and cortical architecture systems in the moments leading up to seizure onset. Our results support and enlarge the interictal suppression hypothesis, suggesting a network protective mechanism through inhibition, related to a perturbatory event as the seizure onset. Overall, the dynamic aperiodic exponent emerges as a promising non-invasive marker with potential applications in seizure prediction and network-targeted neuromodulation.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

Of particular interest, the XBB.1.5 variant has been shown to cause vaccine-breakthrough cases. Biological E (BE) has utilized the same platform it used to develop CORBEVAX, an ancestral Wuhan strain COVID-19 RBD subunit vaccine (control vaccine), to now develop an XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine (test vaccine). Methods To assess the safety and immunogenicity of BE's new XBB.1.5 subunit vaccine, a prospective, randomized, single-blind Phase III study was conducted in 5 to 80 year olds. Participants who had not received any other approved COVID-19 vaccine within the last 6 months prior were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to receive two booster doses of either the test vaccine or the control vaccine. The vaccines were administered on Day 0 and Day 28 with immunogenicity assessments on Day 0, Day 28, and Day 42. Safety assessments included the collection of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) up until Day 56. The primary objective of the study was to show immunogenic superiority of the test vaccine booster series compared to the control vaccine series. This superiority objective was to be concluded if the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the anti-XBB.1.5.RBD neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio of test : control was >1.0 on either Day 28 or Day 42. Given the emergence of JN.1 as the SARS-CoV-2 strain during the conduct of this study, Day 42 anti-JN.1 nAb were measured in a post hoc immunogenicity assessment. In addition, anti-XBB.1.5 RBD protein IgG concentration in the sera samples were also measured by ELISA on Day 0, Day 28, and Day 42. Findings A total of 360 participants were enrolled and randomized across 7 sites in India. The nAb GMT ratio of test : control participants was 2.08 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.63) on Day 28 and 2.91 (95% CI 2.38 to 3.56) on Day 42. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of neutralizing antibodies (nAb) was 7.637 (95% CI 6.090 to 9.578) on Day 28 and 17.02 (95% CI 13.79 to 21.01) on Day 42 in the test booster series arm. The nAb GMFRs in the control booster series arm at the same time points were 3.033 (95% CI 2.340 to 3.932) and 4.824 (95% CI 3.731 to 6.236) respectively. Post hoc analyses revealed an nAb GMT ratio of 1.90 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.31) of test : control against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain. The safety profile of the new XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine was found to be very similar to that of the Ancestral strain vaccine with 59 AEs (about 1 AE for every 8 doses administered) and 27 AEs (a little less than 1 AE for every 8 doses administered) respectively during the study. No serious AEs or AEs of special interest were reported in either the test or control arm of the study. Two cases of pyrexia were medically attended to, one in each arm. Interpretations Biological E's new XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine was found to be both safe and robustly immunogenic when administered as a two-dose booster series in 5 to 80 year olds. In particular, the vaccine induced a significant rise in neutralizing antibodies against the XBB.1.5 strain as well as cross-protective neutralizing antibodies against the JN.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain. These data are in line with studies of other XBB.1.5 monovalent vaccines and support a positive risk-benefit profile. Real world studies may provide additional evidence about the effectiveness of this new updated vaccine. CTRI Trial Registration Identifier: CTRI/2024/01/061423","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

We addressed factors that hinder causal interpretation of associations previously shown in the literature and their translation into clear public health policies. Specifically: 1) spatial confounding by area-level covariates, 2) collinearity among and identification of the most relevant air pollutants, and 3) the time window for pollution exposure. Furthermore, we used chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and frequency of oily fish intake in positive and negative control analyses.

DesignProspective longitudinal study

ParticipantsEyes with early or intermediate AMD at baseline were defined based on the Age-Related Eye Disease Study severity scale. High genetic risk was defined as the third tertile of a genetic risk score for progression, adjusted for age, race and sex.

MethodsInformation on lifestyle behaviors was obtained from baseline risk and food frequency questionnaires. Risk-inducing and health-promoting lifestyle profiles were defined based on dichotomous categorizations of smoking, body-mass index (BMI), and dietary caloric intake, green leafy vegetables and fish, in never and ever smokers. Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs), relative risks (RRs) and population attributable risks (PARs) were calculated, adjusting for inter-eye correlation, demographic factors, macular status and family history.

Main Outcome MeasuresProgression to advanced AMD (AAMD) and subtypes geographic atrophy (GA) and neovascular (NV), confirmed at 2 consecutive visits over 5 years of follow-up.

ResultsAmong 898 high genetic risk eyes, 207 eyes progressed to AAMD (23%). Among never smokers, a high risk-inducing lifestyle profile conferred a 3-fold increased incidence of AAMD, compared to an ideal health-promoting lifestyle profile [HR = 3.3 (CI 1.8, 6.4), P <0.001]. In ever smokers, a risk-inducing profile was independently associated with a 5-fold increased incidence of AAMD [HR = 5.3 (CI 2.3,11.9), P <0.001]. Stronger effects of these lifestyle behaviors were seen for GA compared to NV. Estimated PARs suggested adopting an ideal health-promoting profile could prevent 56% of incident AAMD in never smokers and 60% in ever smokers.

ConclusionUnhealthy behaviors increased incidence of AAMD by 3 to 5-fold among a highly genetically susceptible population, and 56-60% of AAMD incidence was attributed to the modifiable factors of smoking, high BMI, high caloric intake and low intake of foods rich in lutein-zeaxanthin and omega-3 fatty acids. These results underscore the importance of lifestyle interventions even in high genetic risk populations, such as relatives of affected patients, to reduce progression from early and intermediate AMD to advanced vision-threatening stages.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

Understanding shared genetic factors underlying CVD and its comorbidities can help develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.

MethodsIn this study, we investigated genetic correlations between CVD and common comorbidities using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the FinnGen R12 release. Following standard quality control procedures, we examined 19 disease endpoints using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to estimate heritability and pairwise genetic correlations. Disease traits with significant heritability (z-score [&ge;] 4) and Bonferroni-corrected significant correlations (adjusted p < 0.05) were selected for genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM) to construct a latent genomic factor (LGF), representing shared genetic liability.

ResultsOut of the 19 diseases, four CVDs (transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and heart failure) and seven comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gingivitis and hypertension) showed statistically significant genetic correlations. A multivariate GWAS of the LGF identified 141 novel associated loci across 29 independent SNPs. These loci overlapped with 16 protein-coding genes, including NPC1, TMEM106B, PTPN22, MAP2K5 and MSRA, implicating them in the shared pathogenesis of CVD and its comorbidities.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight a shared genetic architecture underlying CVD and its comorbidities, revealing cross-disease genetic risk factors that may enhance joint risk prediction, inform precision medicine strategies, and offer insights into common biological mechanisms and potential targets for integrated therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361630

While clinical research on SCAs has expanded over the past two decades, it is unclear whether the populations included in these studies reflect the demographic diversity of those affected. Assessing representation is critical to ensuring research findings are generalizable and applicable to diverse patient populations.

MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of global clinical research on SCAs published in English between January 2004 and May 2024. Searches were performed in Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase, and Web of Science. Studies were included if they enrolled [&ge;]10 participants and excluded if they were case reports, reviews, or meta-analyses. We extracted data from 1,474 studies on geographic location, participant karyotypes, and demographic metrics, including race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) reported. Trends in demographic reporting were examined over time and by geographic region. For U.S.-based studies reporting race/ethnicity, we compared pooled participant demographics to national census data.

ResultsSCA research is concentrated within a small number of geographic areas, primarily in Europe (51.4%) and the U.S. (23.6%). Reporting rates of race or ethnicity for U.S. papers increased over the 20-year observation period, with an average increase of 1.5% {+/-} 0.4% per year (p = 0.003), peaking in 2024 with 61.4% of U.S.-based papers presenting demographics. When reported, studies consistently overrepresented non-Hispanic White (p<0.001) and college-educated (p<0.001) participants relative to U.S. census benchmarks.

ConclusionsThis systematic review reveals persistent gaps in the demographic reporting and representation of participants in SCA research. Even in the U.S., where population diversity is high, published studies do not reflect the expected racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic makeup of affected individuals. To ensure that research findings are equitable and clinically relevant, future studies should adopt standardized demographic reporting and prioritize inclusive enrollment strategies to reflect the full spectrum of individuals with SCAs.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631

Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, only 5% of CC patients receive appropriate treatment. In 2021, Mozambique integrated the prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its national immunization program as a primary prevention strategy. As part of a qualitative research effort on participatory modeling, this study aimed to quantify the magnitude and distribution of expected health and economic outcomes of the current HPV vaccination program, hypothetical scale-up scenarios, and global targets.

We applied and extended a closed cohort model to quantify the vaccine programs direct potential population health benefits (in averted CC cases and deaths), financial savings to patients (in direct medical treatment costs saved and in financial risk protection provided), health provider benefits measures in saved labour (full-time equivalents, FTEs) and distribution of benefits under empirically informed and potential vaccination coverage scenarios.

With a coverage of 18.9% in 2021, the vaccination program is estimated to avert up to 9.7% of expected CC cases and deaths (from 4.0% in the highest socioeconomic quintile (HQ) to 11.6% in the lowest socioeconomic quintile (LQ)). Across the lifetime of a single vaccination cohort, an average of US$106,532 (min: US$48,382, max: US$157,811) in direct medical CC treatment expenditure for patients and the time equivalent to 59 full-time healthcare workers is saved per year. Over 30 years, 50% vaccination coverage could prevent 23.9% of predicted cases and fatalities (LQ: 25.2% to HQ: 14.8%). With a gradient in vaccine coverage favoring higher socioeconomic quintiles in urban areas, the benefits in the LQ rural population are estimated to be six times greater than in the LQ urban population.

These findings can contribute to fair and efficient planning decisions from various stakeholder perspectives in policy dialogues around the HPV vaccination programme in Mozambique, and at a global level.

This paper describes how two financial metrics were used to estimate the return on investments of drugs developed by the PDP Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) as a case study.

MethodsThe internal rate of return (IRR) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) were used to estimate the economic return on investment for the PDP. IRR was based on total investments from 2000 to 2023 and health gains derived from PDP-supported drugs, measured as monetized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) minus the delivery cost of the products. BCR was calculated by dividing the present value of monetized DALYs by the present value of cost, indicating the overall efficiency and impact of the investments received by MMV.

FindingsTotal investment received was $2{middle dot}3 billion over the study period, and the antimalarial drugs developed and launched with the support of MMV averted an estimated 1{middle dot}6 million deaths and 87 million DALYs for a cost of delivery estimated at $785 million. The IRR for the base scenario was 52{middle dot}13% (CI: 52{middle dot}11% - 52{middle dot}16%) and the BCR 12{middle dot}99 (CI: 12{middle dot}92 - 13{middle dot}06).

InterpretationThe substantial IRR and BCR generated by investment in antimalarial drug development suggest that the PDP model has a potentially pivotal role to play in global health.

FundingNo funding to declare.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and manually inspected the results using ""internal rate of return"", ""IRR"", ""benefit-cost ratio*"", ""BCR"", ""return on investment"", ""ROI"", ""product development partnerships"", ""PDP"" as keywords, in English, and up until February 2025. We also performed a search in the grey literature and included in our review reports and articles published by consulting organizations, funders, government organisations, and development banks.

Both internal rate of return (IRR) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) are widely used to inform investment decisions in the public and private sector. The need for better data to inform global health R&D investments is long recognised and our searches indicate a continued lack of consensus on the preferred metrics and methods.1 A recent scoping review showed that there were inconsistencies in the calculation and interpretation of ROI associated with public health interventions.1 The authors called for more transparency when reporting underlying assumptions.

Most economic evaluations focused on low- and middle-income countries estimate the cost-effectiveness of specific interventions or products.2 Literature on the benefit cost ratios and estimates on the value of global health investments in monetary terms are uncommon.3,4 Moreover, understanding the return on investing in global R&D is rarer still.5 In the UK, a series of influential analyses using the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) demonstrated the economic returns of medical research funding for four diseases (cancer, mental health, cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal diseases).6 To date, no peer-reviewed publications have evaluated the return on investment in the R&D generated by product-development partnerships (PDPs).

Added value of this studyThis paper contributed to knowledge in several ways. Firstly, from an empirical perspective we learn that investing in malaria research and development through the PDP model has resulted in a positive return on investment, driven by providing access to effective antimalarial treatments, averting 1{middle dot}6 million deaths. Secondly, we demonstrate that a rigorous analysis of PDP returns on investment can be conducted using routine data and standardised methods to inform both productive and allocative efficiency decisions. Finally, from a policy perspective, this paper is able to show that investment in R&D, and PDPs specifically, are a competitive investment when compared to other health and non-health investments.

Implications of all the available evidenceIn a funding environment where large-scale investments are increasingly coming under scrutiny, this work demonstrates that it is possible to calculate the return on investment from PDPs using routine data and standardised methods. This paper offers a retrospective and conservative view of what has been achieved. Even with this more conservative methodology, it is clear that the investment received by MMV allowed it to respond to existing market failures and develop a portfolio of drugs that have positive health and economic returns. Our paper is an example of how global health investments can assess their returns on research investment in a transparent and robust way to inform policy making and funding allocation.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631

Previous genome-wide association studies on these pregnancy outcomes have been successful but have overlooked the number of a mothers previous pregnancies. In this study, we explored if parity (the number of children a mother has previously delivered) modifies the maternal or foetal genetic effect of gestational duration and birth weight (gene x parity interactions) using data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study in up to 58,528 mothers and their offspring. Potential genetic effect differences were investigated by: (1) performing parity-stratified genome-wide association studies, (2) testing SNP x parity interactions, (3) testing the interaction between a polygenic prediction of the traits and parity, and (4) assessing the genetic correlation within each outcome across parity. For both phenotypes, we identified shared and distinct loci for each outcome in terms both of genetic region and number in the parity-stratified genome-wide association studies, and the genetic correlation by parity deviated from one for all outcomes. The strongest evidence of genetic modification effect by parity was found for gestational duration in the maternal genome where genetic effects were stronger in the first pregnancy compared to later pregnancies. For instance, the polygenic prediction of the maternal genome on gestational duration had a significant interaction with parity (p-value interaction = 5 x 10-5). The results for birth weight were more uncertain, suggesting that the identified gene x parity interactions is largely limited to gestational duration. In conclusion, our study reveals that parity modifies the genetic effects on gestational duration and highlights the relevance of considering parity in genetic studies on pregnancy outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631

Using drug target Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, we assessed the effects of cardiometabolic drug classes on kidney function indices in the general population.

MethodWe leveraged 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetically proxies for targets of antihypertensives (Ca-channel blockers/CCB, beta-blockers/BB, ACE inhibitors/ACEI), lipid-lowering drugs (PCSK9 inhibitors/PCSK9I, statins, NPC1L1 inhibitors/NPC1L1I), and antidiabetics (metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors/SGLT2I, GLP1R agonist/GLP1RA) drugs. Genetic instruments reflected lowering of systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL cholesterol, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). We used summary statistics from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of log natural annual change of estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (n=334,339), cross-sectional creatinine- and cystatin-based eGFR, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (n=1,201,909) as kidney function outcome. Two-sample MR and sensitivity methods (simple mode, weighted mode, weighted median, and MR Egger) were applied.

ResultsThe annual change of eGFR was attenuated by genetically proxied PCSK9I ({beta}=0.066 per mmol/L LDL lowering; 95%CI 0.008,0.125). Cross-sectional eGFRcrea was increased by CCBs ({beta}=0.006 per 10 mmHg SBP lowering; 95%CI 0.001,0.011), SGLT2I ({beta}=0.024-0.028), MC1 ({beta}=0.022), and GDF15 ({beta}=0.094-0.100) per 6.7 mmol/mol HbA1c lowering. Statins and NPC1L1I may reduce eGFR and SGLT2I may decrease annual eGFR change.

Intervention efficacy and treatment response were evaluated before treatment and after the 10th, 20th, 30th sessions, and 1- and 3-months post-intervention. Cognitive functions and brain connectivity were also assessed. Compared to the sham group, both active tDCS groups significantly reduced depressive symptoms up to 3 months following the intervention, and the therapeutic effects were observed from session 10th only in the multichannel tDCS groups. Furthermore, the effect size from the optimized multichannel protocol was significantly larger than the conventional tDCS.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients.

Here, we identify mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein FUS in cortical neurons as a defining feature in ALS patients with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci). Selective mislocalization of FUS in adult cortical projection neurons in mice is sufficient to trigger ALS-ci- and ALS with behavioral impairment (ALS-bi)-like phenotypes, including deficits in sociability, and neurodegeneration. Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal a conserved FUS-dependent gene network downregulated in these mice and ALS-ci patients. This regulon is enriched for ALS genetic risk factors and newly implicates FBXO16 in ALS-bi. Carriers of protein-truncating FBXO16 variants display behavioral abnormalities, frontotemporal atrophy, and increased levels of dementia-linked biomarkers. These findings define a neuron-intrinsic mechanism for cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in ALS and nominate FUS mislocalization and its downstream gene network as therapeutic targets.

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

Here, we present a comprehensive proximity labeling study of five conserved Caenorhabditis elegans proteins--NEKL-2, NEKL-3, MLT-2, MLT-3, and MLT-4--that form two NEKL-MLT kinase-scaffold subcomplexes involved in membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Using endogenously expressed TurboID fusions and a data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (MS) pipeline, we profiled NEKL-MLT interactomes across 23 experiments, including several methodological variations, applying stringent controls and filtering strategies. By analyzing and comparing experimental outcomes, we develop a set of intuitive quantitative metrics to assess experimental outcomes and quality. We demonstrate that DIA-based workflows produce sensitive physiologically relevant findings, even in the presence of experimental noise and variability across biological replicates. Our approach is validated through the identification of known NEKL-MLT binding partners and conserved genetic suppressors of nekl-mlt mutant phenotypes. Gene ontology enrichment further supports the involvement of newly identified NEKL-MLT interactors in processes including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal regulation, and cell adhesion. Additionally, several novel proximate interactors were functionally validated using genetic assays. Our findings underscore the utility of DIA-MS in proximity labeling applications and highlight the value of incorporating internal controls, quantitative metrics, and biological validation to enhance confidence in candidate interactors. Overall, this study provides a scalable, organismal-level strategy for probing endogenous protein networks and offers practical guidelines for proximity labeling in multicellular systems.","NA","biorxiv",1750457361631

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking).

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750457361631
