These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility optimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/bmo, a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Because variable RBDs of different SARS-CoV-2 strains must bind to the same human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for viral cell entry and infection, we hypothesize that designing a protein with the same or very similar hACE2 binding interface might have a broad-spectrum effect against various SARS-CoV-2 strains. The designed protein binds specifically to the WT-RBD (with micromolar affinity) but not to RBDs from other SARS-CoV-2 strains. However, two rounds of the E. coli display and Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) selection are sufficient to yield a protein named CYN1 with nanomolar binding affinities not only to the WT-RBD but also to those of Omicron BA.1, XBB.1.16, and JN.1. Molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy hotspot analysis revealed that CYN1's broader spectrum capability stems from its engagement of essentially all ACE2 hotspot residues critical for WT-RBD binding, unlike the designed protein. The discovery of CYN1, differing by only four mutations from the designed protein, confirms that targeting the small interface of human viral receptors, rather than the entire receptor, offers a viable strategy for developing broad-spectrum inhibitors. This approach minimizes potential off-target effects arising from receptor multifunctionality.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

While allelic pleiotropy describes variant effects on both local and distal genes or a mixture of molecular effects on a single gene, here we specifically investigate allelic expression ""proxitropy"": where a single variant influences the expression of multiple, neighboring genes. We introduce a multi-gene eQTL mapping framework - cis-principal component expression QTL (cis-pc eQTL or pcQTL) - to identify variants associated with shared axes of expression variation across a cluster of neighboring genes. We perform pcQTL mapping in 13 GTEx human tissues and discover novel loci undetected by single-gene approaches. In total, we identify an average of 1396 pcQTLs/tissue, 27% of which were not discovered by single-gene methods. These novel pcQTL colocalized with an additional 142 GWAS trait-associated variants and increased the number of colocalizations by 34% over single-gene QTL mapping. These findings highlight that moving beyond single-gene-at-a-time approaches toward multi-gene methods can offer a more comprehensive view of gene regulation and complex trait-associated variation.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Caveolar dynamics, such as movement within the plasma membrane or endocytosis, relies on precise shaping of the highly curved caveolar necks. The dynamin-like EHD2 ATPase is proposed to form an oligomeric scaffold around the caveolar neck, but its detailed molecular action is poorly understood. Here, we employed cryo-electron tomography to elucidate structures of EHD2 filaments oligomerized on tubulated liposomes. EHD2 filaments form a highly curved membrane scaffold which stabilizes a sophisticated tubular membrane geometry with undulations along the tube's axis. An amino-terminal sequence facilitates this geometry by inserting into the membrane, thereby acting as a spacer between adjacent filaments. Moreover, in endothelial cells lacking EHD2, caveolar necks become narrower and elongated. Our structural work provides the molecular framework for understanding EHD2 scaffold formation and its cellular function in caveolar dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

To better understand the progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as ""early"" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), ""middling"" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and ""advanced"" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of microscopically observed morphologic changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

It remains unclear how the limited set of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other proteins activated by these cytokine receptors can encode the observed diversity of immune cell phenotypes. To understand how signaling downstream of cytokines control immune cell phenotype, we sought to map the structure of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling domains to cell signaling and resulting CAR T cell function. We recombined 14 signaling motifs to construct a library of ~30,000 constitutively active synthetic cytokine receptors (SCRs) with intracellular domains composed of novel signaling motif combinations that activate different signaling cascades. We experimentally tested ~450 SCRs which generated a range of CAR T cell memory, cytotoxicity, and proliferation. SCRs with pSTAT1 and 3 signaling generated effector memory CAR T cells, while SCRs with strong pSTAT5 generated effector CAR T cells with potent anti-tumor activity. To map the structure-signaling-phenotype landscape we trained models to predict signaling and CAR T cell phenotype that result from varied motif combinations. From neural network predictions we identified features, including strong STAT5 and Shc signaling, that promote unsafe autonomous CAR T cell proliferation. Models also revealed a trade-off between memory and cytotoxicity, with a Pareto front encoded by a continuous change in signaling. These results demonstrate that recombination of a limited set of signaling motifs creates a continuous spectrum of signaling that encodes a corresponding spectrum of cell phenotype. This work synthetically expands the combinatorial space of JAK/STAT signaling and provides a foundation for rational design of CAR T cells with improved cytotoxicity, memory, and safety profiles.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Here, we compared the identified motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from decomposed electromyography signals acquired during triangular dorsiflexion contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) between resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals (n=23 in each group). We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs). Both trained groups demonstrated greater MU discharge rates with greater ascending discharge rate modulation during higher contraction forces ([&ge;]50% MVF), which were accompanied by more linear MU discharge patterns and greater post-acceleration attenuation slopes of the ascending discharge rates. No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance- compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces ([&le;]50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

As cells differentiate collectively, it raises the question of how tissue-level properties affect instructive cues of decision-making. Here, we show that a tissue rigidity phase transition guides patterning by tuning the length-scales and time-scales of morphogen signalling. By combining rigidity percolation theory, reaction-diffusion modelling, quantitative imaging, optogenetics and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish, we uncover dynamical global tissue rigidity patterns that actively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient by restricting ligand dispersal and accelerating its signalling activity. In this self-generated mechanism, Nodal, besides driving meso-endoderm fate specification, increases cell-cell adhesion strength via regulating planar cell polarity genes. Once adhesion strength reaches a critical point, it triggers a rigidity transition which collapses tissue porosity. The abrupt tissue reorganisation negatively feeds back on Nodal signalling impacting both its length-scales, by limiting Nodal diffusivity, and its time-scales, by speeding up the expression of its antagonist Lefty, thereby ensuring timely signal termination and robust patterning. Overall, we reveal how emergent properties set the spatiotemporal dynamics of morphogen gradients, uncovering macroscopic mechanisms of pattern formation.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Cultured cells under physical confinement have been shown to experience mechanical stress due to deformation of the nucleus. Nuclear deformation can lead to loss of nuclear integrity and DNA damage, and it has been proposed to underlie cancer initiation and progression. In vivo, the consequences of physical confinement on physiological, developmental cell migration remain so far unexplored. Here, we use the zebrafish neural crest as an in vivo model to address how multipotent embryonic cells respond to physical confinement during developmental migration. By measuring the extracellular space from head to tail along the embryonic body axis, we found that the level of tissue scale confinement increases along the antero-posterior axis. We found that neural crest experience dramatic nuclear deformation during their migrating between adjacent tissues, which quantitatively scales with tissue confinement. By using complementary genetic and mechanical strategies to ablate the surrounding tissue, we observe a rescue of nuclear deformation in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that while deformation of the NC nucleus causes stretching of the nuclear envelope, it does not cause DNA damage even upon extreme deformations. Instead, cells adapt, by decreasing both their DNA damage and LaminB2 levels upon entering confined spaces. In summary, we establish the neural crest as a physiological framework uncovering a dynamic adaptation to tissue confinement in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

PTHrP has been clinically implicated as a putative regulator of cachexia, with serum PTHrP levels correlating with increased weight loss in PDAC patients. Here we show that cachectic PDAC patients have high expression of tumor PTHrP and use a genetically engineered mouse model to functionally demonstrate that deletion of Pthlh (encoding the PTHrP protein) blocks cachectic wasting, dramatically extending overall survival. The re-expression of PTHrP in lowly cachectic models is sufficient to induce wasting and reduce survival in mice, which is reversed by the conditional deletion of the PTHrP receptor, Pth1r, in adipocytes. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PTHrP suppresses de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, leading to a molecular rewiring of adipose depots to promote wasting in the cachectic state. Finally, the pharmacological disruption of the PTHrP-PTH1R signaling axis abrogates wasting, highlighting that a targeted disruption of tumor-adipose crosstalk is an effective means to limit cachexia.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10-8/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes.

OriGene coordinates specialized agents that reason over diverse modalities, including genetic data, protein networks, pharmacological profiles, clinical records, and literature evidence, to generate and prioritize target discovery hypotheses. Through a self-evolving framework, OriGene continuously integrates human and experimental feedback to iteratively refine its core thinking templates, tool composition, and analytical protocols, thereby enhancing both accuracy and adaptability over time. To comprehensively evaluate its performance, we established TRQA, a benchmark comprising over 1,900 expert-level question-answer pairs spanning a wide range of diseases and target classes. OriGene consistently outperforms human experts, leading research agents, and state-of-the-art large language models in accuracy, recall, and robustness, particularly under conditions of data sparsity or noise. Critically, OriGene nominated previously underexplored therapeutic targets for liver (GPR160) and colorectal cancer (ARG2), which demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patient-derived organoid and tumor fragment models mirroring human clinical exposures.

Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of Vibrio ordalii circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other Vibrio species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or ord cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural Vibrio isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the ord metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the ord cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Here, we show that dendritic inhibition terminates plateaus in an all-or-none manner. Plateaus were initially resistant to inhibition but became increasingly susceptible to termination as they progressed. Between two distinct subtypes of dendrite-targeting interneurons, OLMNdnf generated slower postsynaptic currents that terminated plateaus more effectively than OLM2. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were necessary for plateaus, which were prolonged by blocking small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK). A single-compartment model with these two conductances recapitulated core experimental findings and provided a mechanistic explanation for terminations. Plateaus arose from VGCCs maintained in the active state by sustained Ca2+ influx, a positive feedback loop that was quasi-balanced by ISK. Inhibition terminated plateaus by driving the membrane potential below a dynamic threshold to deactivate VGCCs and end the positive feedback loop. Lastly, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that plateaus evoke large dendritic Ca2+ transients that were graded by terminations. Overall, our results demonstrate how the feedback inhibitory circuit interacts with intrinsic cellular mechanisms to regulate plateau potentials and shape dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA1-PYRs.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

In Azotobacter vinelandii and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of nif genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex. Our findings define the interaction surface between NifL and NifA and reveal how this interaction can be manipulated to generate bacterial strains with increased nitrogen fixation rates able to secrete surplus nitrogen outside the cell, a crucial step in engineering improved nitrogen delivery to crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Despite the large body of research on the neurobiology of stress, we have a poor understanding of how trauma rewires social circuits in the brain. To identify how social circuits are re-organized by stress, we interrogated the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH), a key node for both the orchestration of emotionally-relevant behavior and the integration of sensory information. Using a footshock-based model of traumatic stress, we established that a single exposure to a series of unpredictable, inescapable footshocks was sufficient to negatively alter social behavior, resulting in increased violence and social hesitancy. Critically, we found that stress-induced changes to social behavior engaged neural ensembles in the VH, a critical node in the regulation of emotion states. Using a virally-mediated, activity-dependent cellular tagging approach to label two neural ensembles activated by temporally distinct experiences, we were surprised to find that stress-induced violence and stress-induced social hesitancy recruited largely non-overlapping populations of cells in the VH, in contrast to higher degrees of ensemble overlap in unstressed control mice, suggesting that stress biases the brain towards stronger differentiation of distinct social states. Additionally, we found that activity of VH neurons was required for stress-induced aggression. Finally, we found that stress-induced changes to social behaviors and VH activity profiles could be reversed by the introduction of social buffering post-stress. Collectively, our findings suggest that stress drives the VH to dissociably encode specific behavioral states, rather than a single state of negative valence, consistent with a role for multiple structures and distributed ensembles in the modulation of traumatic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

In Vibrio cholerae, the accessory PDF (Def2VCH) confers reduced susceptibility to actinonin (ACT), the most studied PDF inhibitor, while still supporting bacterial growth in absence of the canonical PDF copies (Def1VCH). Crystallographic analysis shows that this reduced susceptibility stems from an arginine-to-tyrosine substitution that probably reduces ACT binding. Strikingly, this resistance signature is shared by integron-encoded PDFs, and transfer of an integron-encoded PDF cassette from Pseudoxanthomonas into a susceptible V. cholerae is sufficient to abolish ACT susceptibility. These findings expose a cryptic reservoir of resistance within the bacterial mobilome and highlight a challenge to the therapeutic potential of PDF-targeting antibiotics: resistance may not only emerge, but is already encoded, mobile, and ready to spread.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

One such program is the Interferon-Responsive Microglia state (IRM), which has been identified in developmental windows, aging, and disease. While the functional importance of this state is becoming increasingly clear, our understanding of the regulatory networks that govern IRM induction remain incomplete. To systematically identify genetic regulators of the IRM state, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in human iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Microglia) using IFIT1 as a representative IRM marker. We identified 772 genes that modulate IRM, including canonical type I interferon signaling genes (IFNAR2, TYK2, STAT1/2, USP18) and novel regulators. We uncovered a non-canonical role for the CCR4-NOT complex subunit CNOT10 in IRM activation, independent of its traditional function. This work provides a comprehensive resource for dissecting IRM biology and highlights both established and novel targets for modulating microglial interferon signaling in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Here we assessed genetic diversity within and among populations from two Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico (n = 43, five sites) and Guadeloupe (n = 25, one site), which contain putative wild and/or introgressed forms. Using whole-genome resequencing data and a phylogenomic framework derived from a broader genomic survey, we parsed individuals into feral derivatives and truly wild forms. Feral cottons display uneven levels of genetic and morphological resemblance to domesticated cottons, with diverse patterns of genetic variation and heterozygosity. These patterns are inferred to reflect a complex history of interspecific and intraspecific gene flow that is spatially highly variable in its effects. Wild cottons in both Caribbean islands appear to be relatively inbred, especially the Guadeloupe samples. Our results highlight the dynamics of population demographics in relictual wild cottons that experienced profound genetic bottlenecks associated with repeated habitat destruction superimposed on a natural ecogeographical distribution comprising widely scattered populations.

The cellular lineages and transcriptional programs underlying this process remain poorly understood in cnidarians. Combining reporter tracing and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify adult neurogenic trajectories in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We uncover two distinct mechanisms: direct differentiation of peptidergic neurons from a multipotent progenitor pool, with identities specified proportionally to existing populations, and a stepwise maturation of cnidocytes (specialized cnidarian neural cells), marked by a transcriptionally distinct intermediate stage. Neural fate commitment is characterized by transient SoxC expression, with a homeodomain code associated with neural identities. These modular strategies support continuous neurogenesis and suggest that neural fate specification may use ancestral principles shared with bilaterians. Our study provides a foundational framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the adult specification of neural cells and their evolutionary diversification across animal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

We then optimize its binding affinity via structure-based rational design. Among the six designed candidates, five were experimentally verified and exhibited enhanced binding affinities compared to the original Ta sequence. Furthermore, we directly compared the binding properties of the RNA aptamers to neutralizing antibodies, and found that the designed aptamer TaG34C demonstrated a comparable binding affinity to the RBD compared to all tested neutralizing antibodies. This highlights its potential as an alternative to existing COVID-19 antibodies.

We tested relationships between eggshell maculation, surface temperature, hormone concentrations before and during incubation, and embryonic growth in Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs developing while artificially incubated in duplicate incubators. We detected 10 steroid hormones in the yolks during development and concentrations of all hormones declined to Day 15 (~2 days before hatch). Steroid declines at Day 9 of incubation were related to eggshell surface temperature, with warmer eggs having higher concentrations of androgens and progestogens, and incubator assignment, as eggs were warmer on average in one incubator than the other. However, eggshell surface temperature was not related to eggshell maculation, embryonic size, or embryonic heart rate during development. These results provide evidence of yolk steroid concentration declines through incubation and suggest that environmental conditions (such as temperature or light) could alter embryonic hormone uptake and/or metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

This immobile state was characterized by a 2-4 Hz breathing profile and replay of the aversive experience in the hippocampus. Suppressing hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) inhibited the emergence of this recovery state, suggesting their role in learning safe locations.

The Southern Ocean is among the regions where these impacts are particularly pronounced. Phytoplankton, which perform the bulk of primary production, both maintain the Antarctic marine food web and contribute to the role of the Southern Ocean as the largest oceanic sink for atmospheric CO2. Previous observational and modeling studies have revealed certain drivers-phytoplankton relationships and highlighted the important confounding factors. In this study, we quantified how climate and environmental drivers interact and influence phytoplankton biomass over a 20-year period, across the entire Southern Ocean, within a multi-factor framework. Specifically, we examined the relationships among atmospheric CO2, surface water pH, sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, dissolved iron concentration, and chlorophyll a concentration. To perform this analysis, we introduced and applied two novel methodological approaches. Firstly, to address seasonal autocorrelation, we combined seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) with piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM). This approach allowed for robust estimation of long-term driver magnitudes and causal pathways, even in the presence of limited sample sizes and complex data structures. Secondly, given the highly interconnected nature of environmental drivers, we employed a data-driven SEM approach to objectively identify causal structures and avoid biases associated with a priori pathway selection. Our results show a clear signal of ocean acidification driven by increasing CO2, iron limitation of phytoplankton biomass during spring, and seasonal differences in both the magnitude and structure of the causal pathways, demonstrating the dynamic nature of seasonal processes in the Southern Ocean. This study presents the first Southern Ocean-wide, multi-factor assessment of climate and environmental impacts on phytoplankton biomass over a two-decade period. It introduces a methodological framework mitigates seasonal autocorrelation to accurately capture long-term seasonal trends, and demonstrates the utility of data-driven causal discovery in resolving complex ecological interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder driven by well-defined genetic risk and characterised by immune dysregulation in response to dietary gluten. However, whether sensitivity or response differences in naive T cell programming contributes to disease susceptibility is not known. To investigate such variation, we developed a sensitive quantitative platform, the momentum assay, which combines standardised, T cell activation with subsequent stimulus withdrawal, enabling measurement of T cell proliferation and survival over time. This assay is integrated with the Cyton2 mathematical model to infer underlying cellular timer programs from population-level dynamics. We applied this method to assess whether naive T cells from individuals with celiac disease (CeD) exhibited altered responses compared to healthy donors (HDs). We found that CD4 but not CD8 T cells from CeD patients showed a hypo-proliferative response following stimulation, associated with impaired secretion of the proliferative and pro-survival cytokine IL-2. Moreover, surface expression of early activation marker, CD69 remained elevated for longer on CD4 T cells from CeD donors after stimulus withdrawal, suggesting prolonged activation and subtle alterations in regulatory feedback mechanisms. These findings reveal previously unrecognised quantitative alterations in naive T cell programming in CeD and underscore the utility of model-based analytical frameworks for detecting subtle functional perturbations in complex immune-mediated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

While the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway is the predominant IAA biosynthesis route, other pathways, like the indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) pathway, have been proposed. The IAOx pathway has garnered attention due to its supposed activation in auxin-overproducing mutants (e.g., sur1, sur2, ugt74b1) and the auxin-like responses triggered by exogenous application of its proposed intermediates: IAOx, indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN), and indole-3-acetamide (IAM). However, despite supporting evidence for individual steps, conclusive physiological relevance of the IAOx pathway remains unproven. Using a comprehensive genetic approach combined with metabolic and phenotypic profiling, we demonstrate that mutating gene families proposed to function in the IAOx pathway does not result in prominent auxin-deficient phenotypes, nor are these genes required for high-auxin production in the sur2 mutant. Our findings also challenge the previously postulated linear IAOx pathway. While exogenously provided IAOx, IAN, and IAM can be converted to IAA in vivo, they do not act as precursors for each other. Finally, our findings question the physiological relevance of IAM and IAN as IAA precursors in plants and suggest the existence of a yet uncharacterized auxin biosynthetic route, likely involving IAOx as an intermediate, for the production of IAA in the sur2 mutant. Future identification of the metabolic steps and the corresponding genes in this new pathway may uncover the previously unknown way of synthesizing IAA in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Additionally, gene co-expression network analysis with single-cell resolution identified a key immune response-related gene module activated in the stressed cells captured in our single-nuclei RNA-seq data. This study reveals the intricate spatial coordination of plant defense responses against pathogen infection and enhances our understanding of the importance of localized cell non-autonomous defense responses in plant-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Traditional methods, such as principal components (PCs), commonly used to adjust for population structure, are limited in capturing fine-scale, non-linear patterns that arise from recent demographic events - patterns that are crucial for understanding rare variant effects. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called SPectral Components (SPCs), which leverages identity-by-descent (IBD) graphs to capture and transform local, non-linear fine-scale population structure into continuous representations that can be seamlessly integrated into genetic analysis pipelines. Using both simulated datasets and empirical data from the UK Biobank (N {approx} 420,000), we demonstrate that SPCs outperform PCs in adjusting for fine-scale population structure. In simulations, SPCs explained over 90% of the fine-scale population structure with fewer components, while PCs captured less than 50%. In the UK Biobank, SPCs reduced the inflation of p-values in the GWAS of an environmental-driven phenotype by 12% compared to PCs, while maintaining a similar performance to PCs in height, a highly heritable phenotype. Additionally, SPCs improved rare variant association analyses, reducing genomic inflation (e.g., from 7.6 to 1.2 in one analysis), and provided more accurate heritability estimates. Spatial autocorrelation analysis further confirmed the ability of SPCs to account for environmental effects, reducing Morans I for both environmental and heritable phenotypes more effectively than PCs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that SPCs provide a robust, scalable adjustment for recent population structure, offering a powerful alternative or complement to PCs in large-scale biobank studies.","NA","medrxiv",1749420542321

This is partly due to a historical view of females occupying a passive role compared with males, which led to ignoring female song even in some well-studied species. We report one such case in yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), as no other study investigated female song in 35 years after the first documentation of solo female songs. We interrogate the seasonal patterns and functions of female song in Galapagos yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia aureola), in which females perform solo song and produce duets with their male social partners. We carried out simulated territory intrusions by broadcasting male, female, or duet songs during breeding and non-breeding seasons, and conducted a territory retention survey for over a year. We measured the association between aggressive response and singing behaviour, sex-specific patterns of response, and territory retention across years. Females sang mostly during the non-breeding season and predominantly in male-led duets. Although females were strongly aggressive towards female song playback, they gave the weakest singing response towards them. There was no association between female aggressive behaviour and song output in response to a simulated intruder. Moreover, the probability of territory retention across years was not explained by song output or aggression in response to intruders, though evidence for this was weak due to the small sample size. We suggest that female song in this year-round resident island system does not function for territory defense or intrasexual competition, but may have other functions.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Recent research underscores the importance of root-exuded coumarins in modulating the root microbiome community structure and facilitating iron uptake. However, interactions between root-associated fungi and coumarins in plant iron nutrition remain unknown. We investigated the mechanism by which a fungal endophyte, Macrophomina phaseolina (F80), enhances Arabidopsis iron nutrition. Fungal-coumarin interactions were assessed by profiling metabolites and measuring iron mobilisation in F80 cultures supplemented with specific coumarins, alongside quantifying growth performance and iron content in Arabidopsis coumarin-biosynthesis mutants inoculated with F80. Our findings reveal that an interaction between the coumarin scopoletin and F80 in the rhizosphere rescues plant growth under iron-limiting conditions by resolving the iron mobility bottleneck. F80 exhibits a capacity to modify scopoletin into iron-chelating catechol coumarin esculetin, thereby releasing available iron. We conclude that Arabidopsis-produced scopoletin functions as a precursor for fungal conversion into iron-chelating coumarins. By extending the role of coumarins from bacterial to fungal members of the root microbiota, this study places coumarins at the centre of commensal-mediated enhancement of plant iron nutrition across microbial kingdoms.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

To elucidate cell-type-specific molecular signatures underlying DR, we generated a high-resolution single-cell transcriptomic atlas of 297,121 retinal cells from 20 Chinese donors, including non-diabetic controls (26.4%), diabetic without retinopathy (23.4%) and DR (50.2%). Following rigorous quality control, batch-effect correction, and clustering and annotation, 10 major retinal cell populations were delineated. Differential expression analyses across disease states within each cell type yielded candidate gene sets, which were further refined via a multi-stage machine-learning pipeline combining L1-regularized logistic regression and recursive feature elimination with cross-validation, alongside bootstrap stability selection. Resulting cell-type-specific classifiers achieved high accuracy (79-95%) and AUCs (0.85-0.99) in distinguishing DR disease states. Enrichment analyses implicated immune activation, oxidative stress, neurodegeneration and synaptic dysfunction pathways across multiple cell types in retina. Integrating 567 unique marker genes from all cell types, a general multilayer perceptron classifier achieved 95.31% overall accuracy on held-out test data, demonstrating the translational potential of these signatures for non-diabetic controls, diabetic without retinopathy and DR classification.

Long before the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerge, it has already undergone significant degeneration, making it a primary site for the onset of the disease. The reasons for this remain elusive. It was recently shown that in layer II neurons of the anterolateral entorhinal cortex (alECLII neurons), which are especially prone to display a very early increase in intracellular amounts of amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau), the large glycoprotein reelin binds to A{beta}, suggesting that reelin functions as a sink for intracellular A{beta}. The expression of reelin is extraordinarily high in alECLII neurons compared to most other cortical neurons. Here, we show by computational modeling that, in a senescent physiology predisposing to frequent inflammation-driven A{beta}42 production bursts, the intracellular amount of A{beta}42-reelin complexes can accumulate to extraordinarily high levels in alECLII neurons compared to the vast majority of cortical neurons. This explains experimental data showing that intracellular accumulations of A{beta}42 positive material ranged from 20 to 80% of the total cytoplasmic volume in EC neurons from patients with sporadic AD. We also show that this extreme intracellular aggregation can cause the accumulation of detrimental hyperphosphorylated tau fragments. Thus, when exposed to recurrent AD-promoting stress, the exceptionally high expression of reelin in alECLII neurons appears to be instrumental in their early demise relative to other cortical neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Here, we examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal circuits - regions implicated in forming cognitive maps - also support the abstraction of emotional experiences. Using functional MRI data collected as participants viewed emotionally evocative film clips, we found that activity in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex predicted self-reported emotion across schematically distinct videos, consistent with a role in structural learning. Computational modeling of emotion transitions revealed that hippocampal responses to films and emotion self-reports could be predicted based on the statistical regularities of emotion transitions across different temporal scales. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal-prefrontal systems represent emotion concepts at multiple levels of abstraction, offering new insight into how the brain organizes emotion knowledge.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

In this study, we focus on optogenetic Cre recombinase and systematically compare the performance of three variants (OptoCre-REDMAP, OptoCre-Vvd, and PA-Cre) for their population-level and single-cell activity. We quantify recombination efficiency, expression variability, and activation dynamics using reporters which produce changes in fluorescence or antibiotic resistance following light-induced Cre activity. Our results indicate that optogenetic recombinase performance can be reporter-dependent, suggesting that this is an important consideration in system design. Further, our single-cell analysis reveals highly heterogeneous activity across cells. Although general trends match expectations for mean levels of light-dependent recombination, we found substantial variation in this behavior across individual cells. In addition, our results show that the timing of recombinase activity is highly variable from cell to cell. These findings suggest critical criteria for selecting appropriate optogenetic recombinase systems and indicate areas for optimization to improve the single-cell capabilities of bacterial optogenetic tools.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

In the gastrointestinal tract, obesogenic high-fat diets enhance intestinal stem cell activity and tumorigenesis. However, the impact of ketogenic diets (KD), which contain even higher lipid content but induce ketogenesis, remains poorly understood. This is particularly relevant for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), who face a high risk of small intestinal tumours. Here, we combine dietary, genetic, and metabolic manipulations in mouse models of spontaneous intestinal adenoma formation to dissect the role of systemic and epithelial ketogenesis in intestinal cancer. We show that KD accelerates tumour burden and shortens survival, independent of ketone body production. Through genetic manipulation of the ketogenic pathway, we modulate local and systemic ketone body production; however, neither inhibition nor augmentation of the ketogenic enzyme HMGCS2 nor disruption of ketolysis altered tumour progression. In contrast, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation did limit adenomatous formation. These findings reveal that dietary lipid content, through FAO rather than ketone body metabolism, influences intestinal tumorigenesis and highlight the need for nuanced consideration of dietary strategies for cancer prevention in genetically susceptible populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

This study applied a gradient-based approach to examine macroscale cortical organization in FND. Methods: We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 64 patients with mixed FND (FND-mixed), 61 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 62 psychiatric controls (PCs) matched on age, sex, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity. Functional connectivity gradients were computed to capture dominant axes of cortical organization. Between-group comparisons were conducted for the top three gradients, and associations with symptom severity were investigated. Subtype-specific patterns in functional motor disorder (n=49) and functional seizure (n=24) were also examined. Analyses controlled for age, sex, and antidepressant use, and were post-hoc adjusted for depression, anxiety, and PTSD-severity, and for childhood maltreatment. Results: The FND-mixed group showed alterations across all three gradients relative to HCs and PCs. Gradient 1 revealed increased values in sensorimotor regions, reflecting a shift toward more association-like connectivity. Gradient 2 showed altered differentiation between sensory systems. Gradient 3 exhibited reduced functional separation between representational and modulatory regions, with prominent shifts in the anterior cingulate cortex. Several regions displaying between-group differences also showed correlations with FND and somatic symptom severity. Analyses revealed overlapping and distinct patterns across subtypes. Conclusions: We provide novel evidence of atypical hierarchical brain organization in FND, highlighting gradient-based approaches for identifying mechanistically-relevant altered functional brain organization.","NA","medrxiv",1749420542321

To adjust learning rates, people could rely on either global, meta-learned differences between environments, or faster but transient adaptations to locally experienced prediction errors. Here, we introduce a new paradigm that allows researchers to measure and empirically disentangle both forms of adaptations. Participants performed short blocks of trials of a continuous estimation task - fishing for crabs - on six different islands that required different optimal (initial) learning rates.

Across two experiments, participants showed fast adaptations in learning rate within a block. Critically, participants also learned global environment-specific learning rates over the time course of the experiment, as evidenced by computational modelling and by the learning rates calculated on the very first trial when revisiting an environment (i.e., unconfounded by transient adaptations).

Using representational similarity analyses of fMRI data, we found that differences in voxel pattern responses in the central orbitofrontal cortex correlated with differences in these global environment-specific learning rates. Our findings show that humans adapt learning rates at both slow and fast time scales, and that the central orbitofrontal cortex may support meta-learning by representing environment-specific task-relevant features such as learning rates.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Understanding the biosynthetic genes and pathways underlying strawberry terpene metabolism provides resources for developing precision breeding strategies to improve strawberry aroma traits. Here we describe the genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the terpene synthase (TPS) family that governs terpene chemical diversity in strawberries. Mining of the allo-octoploid genome of the cultivar Royal Royce identified 75 TPS gene candidates. Biochemical characterization of 27 predicted mono-, sesqui- and di-TPS enzymes via in vitro activity assays and in vivo enzyme co-expression studies demonstrated a range of TPS activities that are relevant for the biosynthesis of two thirds of known strawberry terpenes as well as products not previously described in octoploid strawberry. Complementary metabolomic and transcriptomic studies across a diversity panel of strawberry accessions demonstrated substantial variation in the composition and abundance of more than 30 detected accession-specific and common terpene aromas, nine of which matching characterized TPS products. Analysis of a developmental time series of two accessions with contrasting aroma further revealed accession-specific alterations of terpene metabolism during fruit ripening. These results expand our understanding of strawberry aroma metabolism and characterized terpene aroma genes as a resource for the molecular breeding of desirable aroma traits.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Through RNA-RNA interactome profiling and transcriptomic analysis, followed by in vitro structural probing and in vivo validations, we demonstrate that AdiZ directly base-pairs with and negatively regulates ptsG, pykF, and dmsA mRNAs involved in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and anaerobic respiration, respectively. Intriguingly, AdiZ is induced and facilitates Salmonella survival within macrophages, where acidic and hypoxic stresses prevail. Thus, simultaneous expression of AdiA and AdiZ from a single mRNA ties arginine-dependent acid resistance to metabolic reprogramming of Salmonella in the host intracellular niches.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

This question is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in evolutionary biology, and is particularly urgent in marine species, which are experiencing catastrophic anthropogenic impacts. We address this critical gap by estimating genetic diversity for 93 marine species sampled over 9,000 localities. For each species, we aggregate biotic traits and abiotic geographic data for their ranges. We show that diversity increases with range extent and planktonic dispersal. We hypothesize that these traits increase a species' ability to avoid or recover from bottlenecks, thereby maintaining diversity. Our findings provide insights into the factors interacting to shape genomic variation in the ocean, and offer a predictive framework for understanding marine biodiversity in the face of global change.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

To determine mechanisms that determine long-lasting versus short-term immunity, we examined varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccination as a model system. We contrasted VZV antigen-specific T cells several years after vaccination in adults who had been vaccinated at young (<20 years) or older age (>50 years) with a live-attenuated vaccine that confers durable protection only when given at young age, or with an adjuvanted VZV component vaccine that elicits effective, long-lasting immunity in older adults. CD8+ T cells were highly sensitive to age-related changes showing T cell subset shifts, loss in TCR diversity and reduced stem-like features while gaining NK-like signatures without evidence for cellular senescence or exhaustion. VZV-specific CD4+ T cells were largely resilient to age and maintained phenotypic and TCR diversity. Immunization of older adults with the adjuvanted VZV vaccine did not reverse age-associated defects in CD8+ T cells. Instead, it selectively improved the functionality of VZV-specific Th17 CD4+ T cells and prevented their acquisition of Treg features, likely as consequence of lipid metabolic pathways. Collectively, our data indicate that effective vaccination in older adults is supported by the generation of a durable, antigen-specific CD4+ Th17 population that resists mis-differentiation into Tregs and that compensates for age-related defects in CD8+ T cells.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Treatment options for IVH are limited in their ability to improve long-term functional status. One promising target for treatment is the profound cellular inflammatory response that occurs after injury, but advances have been limited by our incomplete understanding of this phenomenon. We leveraged Recovery After Cerebral Hemorrhage, a prospective, observational study at the University of Maryland, to address this question. We sought to characterize the immune cell populations in the intraventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after IVH. To do so, we generated the first reported single-nucleusRNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data on CSF after acute brain injury. We performed 10x Genomics snRNA-seq of nuclei isolated from the CSF of 7 patients (ICH=6, SAH=1), yielding 11,191 high-quality transcriptomes. We identified four major cell populations, which we annotated as neutrophils (53.8%), monocytes (26.1%), lymphocytes (17.8%), and other cells (2.4%) based on the expression of canonical gene markers. Sub-clustering revealed distinct subtypes of neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes that shared features with populations previously described in the systemic circulation. Neutrophils were categorized into nascent, quiescent, and interferon-activated states. The interferon-activated state has not been observed in the central nervous system previously. Monocytes were predominantly of a classical phenotype. Lymphocytes were predominantly T-cells, with the largest populations being naive and central memory CD4+ T-cells. This snRNA-seq data informed the design of a flow cytometry panel that we used to validate the presence of cell subtypes identified by transcriptomics. This analysis demonstrates the feasibility of snRNA-seq approaches to identify previously unexplored pathways and immune cell types that may be relevant to disease. We anticipate that these tools will enable the discovery of new targets to mitigate inflammation-related secondary damage after IVH.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

While there have been thousands of host-pathogen PPIs determined to date, the lack of structural information for these impedes the study of the prevalence of molecular mimicry and convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. To address this, we benchmarked AlphaFold2 and 3 for prediction of structures of host-pathogen interactions observing that accurate models can be retrieved when ranking by modelling confidence, despite an overall low performance. We predicted structures for 6,782 pathogen-human PPIs yielding 803 models of higher confidence. Most pathogen proteins interacting with a common human protein are predicted to do so via the same interface, suggesting a high degree of convergent evolution of protein interaction interfaces. When comparing structural models from host-pathogen and host-host interactions, we observe that a majority of pathogen proteins are predicted to target existing human PPI interfaces. We categorized instances of mimicry into different modes, occurring at different frequencies: 1) via the same domain family (least common); 2) via a similar structural motif; and 3) via a similar linear motif (most common). We selected examples of linear motif interactions for binding assay testing, confirming 8 out of 12 predicted interfaces, including 3 viral linear motif interactions. This validates AlphaFold's ability to model some host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms underlying molecular mimicry. This work showcases the value of large-scale structural modelling to study convergent evolution of host-pathogen interactions and how molecular mimicry may contribute to infection or host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

However, the richness of such data means that conventional analyses may only scratch its surface. Extracting meaningful insights from these datasets often requires advanced computational methods and domain expertise. Current AI agents for biology are primarily focused on executing user-specified commands and are therefore limited by the users creativity and familiarity with which kinds of analyses are useful. Furthermore, these agents do not account for prior analyses already attempted by researchers, reducing their ability to build upon existing work. To address these limitations, we introduce CellVoyager, an AI agent that autonomously explores scRNA-seq datasets in novel directions conditioned on prior user-ran analyses. Built on large language models, CellVoyager ingests both the dataset and a record of prior analyses to generate and test new hypotheses within a Jupyter notebook environment. We evaluate CellVoyager on CellBench, a new benchmark based on 50 published scRNA-seq studies encompassing 483 analyses. Given only the background sections of these papers, CellVoyager outperformed GPT-4o and o3-mini by up to 20% in predicting which analyses the authors eventually conducted. We then carried out three in-depth case studies where CellVoyager is given previously published papers with their scRNA-seq datasets and conducts analyses to generate new findings. The original authors of each study evaluated these findings and consistently rated them as creative and sound; 80% of the agents hypotheses were deemed scientifically interesting. For example, in one case study, the agent found that CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 infection are more primed for pyroptosis, which was not explored by the original researchers. CellVoyager also reanalyzed a brain aging dataset to discover a previously unreported association between increased transcriptional noise and aging in the subventricular zone of the brain. These results demonstrate that CellVoyager can act both autonomously and collaboratively to accelerate hypothesis generation and computational biology. It also highlights the potential of agents like CellVoyager to unlock new biological insights by reanalyzing the vast existing biological data at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

While the advent of single-cell transcriptomics has allowed for the discovery and identification of transcriptionally distinct cell populations present during lung development, the spatiotemporal dynamics of these transcriptional shifts remain undefined. With imaging-based spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed the gene expression patterns in 17 human infant lungs at varying stages of development and lung injury, creating a spatial transcriptomic atlas of ~1.2 million cells. We applied computational clustering approaches to identify shared molecular similarities among this cohort, generating hypotheses about how tissue architecture and molecular spatial relationships are coordinated during normal development and disrupted in disease. Recognizing that all preterm birth represents an injury to the developing lung, we have moved away from the conventional paradigm of classifying an infant lung as belonging to 'disease' or 'control' groups in favor of a linear regression approach that accounts for the routinely collected objective measures of gestational age and life span. Within this new framework, we have identified cell type patterns across these variables that would likely be overlooked when using a binary, conventional 'diseased' vs. 'control' comparison. Together, these data represent an open resource for the lung research community, supporting discovery-based inquiry and identification of targetable molecular mechanisms in both normal and arrested human lung development.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Surprisingly, the developmental processes underlying gill formation in zebrafish remain poorly understood. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the morphogenesis of gill arteries, filaments and lamellae during lifelong development.

Our results provide important insights into the temporal and spatial pattern of gill angiogenesis, revealing fundamental differences in the formation of lateral versus medial filaments along the dorso-ventral axis. These early asymmetries correlate with, and likely underlie, the structural asymmetries observed in adult gills, which we quantitatively characterize. This indicates that a region-specific developmental programme establishes a blueprint for gill architecture maintained throughout life.

We further show that lamellae develop through a complex interplay between endothelial and cranial neural crest-derived pillar cells. Notably, lamellar size, which strongly influences respiratory efficiency, depends on the position of the filament in the arch. Together, our work identifies key cellular and temporal mechanisms driving gill development and provides a framework to investigate broader principles of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

EVs were separated by differential centrifugation followed by size exclusion chromatography and characterized using nanoflow cytometry, single-particle reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS), and transmission electron microscopy. EV size, yield, and morphology did not differ significantly between MS and control samples. Proteomic analyses revealed downregulation of synaptic and mitochondrial proteins and upregulation of complement and inflammatory proteins and pathways in MS WM EVs. This suggests that EVs reflect ongoing synaptic pathology, metabolic dysfunction, and CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and that they may actively contribute to these pathological processes. Deconvolution analyses suggests a shift in EV cellular origin, with an increased astrocytic and decreased neuronal EV contributions in MS. Several proteomic changes we observed in CNS-derived EVs have also been reported in circulating EVs of people with MS, establishing this CNS tissue EV study as a valuable resource for identifying biomarker candidates for brain-derived plasma EV studies.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout -- breakpoint, or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the Progressive Ratio with Reset (PRR) task, rats perform the PR task on one lever, but can press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers are retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length -- the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward -- and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of ""overharvesting"" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing whether and how rats adapt their behavior to the cost-benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

However, most genetic studies of BIK1 and PBL1 functions were carried out with single T-DNA insertional mutant alleles. Some phenotypes observed in these mutants, e.g. autoimmunity, have been difficult to reconcile with the proposed role of BIK1 and PBL1 in pattern-triggered immunity. In this study, we generated multiple new alleles of bik1 and pbl1 by CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing and systematically analyzed these mutants alongside existing T-DNA insertional lines. These analyses reinforced the central role of BIK1 and PBL1 in pattern-triggered immunity mediated by both receptor kinases and receptor-like proteins. At the same time, however, we revealed several pleiotropic phenotypes associated with T-DNA insertions that are not necessarily linked to loss of BIK1 or PBL1 function. Further analyses of newly generated bik1 pbl1 double mutants uncovered an even greater contribution of these kinases to immune signaling and disease resistance than previously appreciated. These findings clarify longstanding ambiguities surrounding BIK1 and PBL1 functions.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

Yet the cognition driving this dynamic--and its broader implications--remains poorly understood. Here, we show that nest-building zebra finches follow a copy-if-dissatisfied strategy, but only when social information aligns with recent experience: after observing a conspecific build a nest, males were more likely to choose the demonstrated 'social' material--particularly on their first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using Bayesian cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms underpinned males' material choices, identifying two asocial and two social governing parameters. These parameters provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of birds' nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not prescripted--by these parameters approximated observed material-choice trajectories, supporting their causal role. Additional simulations targeting simplified real-world contexts showed that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction--drove social material choice, though higher rewards did not proportionally boost its use, offering preliminary insights into the mechanisms underlying material-use variation more broadly. Our study illustrates how computational modelling can robustly link behaviour to underlying learning mechanisms and probe the generalisability of animal cognition--a rarity in this field.","NA","biorxiv",1749420542321

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749420542321

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1749420542321

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749420542321

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
