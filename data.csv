In healthy controls (HC) regulation of CBF is complex and involves multiple mechanisms including cardiac output (CO), cerebral perfusion pressure, PO2 and PCO2, flow-metabolism coupling, and innervation of cerebral vessels. In ME/CFS multiple other mechanisms have also been identified. Aim of the study: We previously found that both CBF and CO were reduced in ME/CFS patients during tilt testing, and we hypothesized that the relation between CBF and CO is abnormal and different from HC. In this retrospective study we analyzed this relation in a large group of patients. To compare the patient data with those of HC, we focused on patients with a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to upright tilt. Also, the influence of clinical data was analyzed. Methods: A total of 534 ME/CFS patients and 49 HC underwent tilt testing with measurements of HR, BP, CBF, and CO. In 46 (9%) patients CO and CBF changes were in the normal range of HC, and in 488 (91%) an abnormal CO and CBF reduction was found. Results: patients with a CO and CBF reduction in the range of HC had less severe disease and were more likely to be male. In patients with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction the slope of the regression line of CO versus CBF reduction was almost 1. A multiple regression analysis of the latter group, including patients with PetCO2 measurements (440/488: 90%) showed that the CO reduction for the major part predicted the CBF reduction, with a limited role for the PetCO2 reduction and the tilt duration. Other data did not add to the model. Conclusions: Two different patient groups with a normal HR and BP response during the tilt were identified: those with a CO and CBF in the normal range of HC and those with an abnormal CO and CBF reduction during the tilt (91% of patients). The former group had milder disease and included more men. In the largest group of patients there was an almost 1:1 relation between the CO and CBF reduction, suggesting absence of compensatory vasodilation in the cerebral vasculature. This may be an appropriate target for clinical and therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642372

Here, we describe proseLM, a method for protein sequence design based on adaptation of protein language models to incorporate structural and functional context. We show that proseLM benefits from the scaling trends of underlying language models, and that the addition of non-protein context -- nucleic acids, ligands, and ions -- improves recovery of native residues during design by 4-5% across model scales. These improvements are most pronounced for residues that directly interface with non-protein context, which are faithfully recovered at rates >70% by the most capable proseLM models. We experimentally validated proseLM by optimizing the editing efficiency of genome editors in human cells, achieving a 50% increase in base editing activity, and by redesigning therapeutic antibodies, resulting in a PD-1 binder with 2.2 nM affinity.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

Identifying and controlling dose-dependent transgenes require tools for precisely titrating expression. To this end, we developed a highly modular, extensible framework called DIAL for building editable promoters that allow for fine-scale, heritable changes in transgene expression. Using DIAL, we increase expression by recombinase-mediated excision of spacers between the binding sites of a synthetic zinc finger transcription factor and the core promoter. By nesting varying numbers and lengths of spacers, DIAL generates a tunable range of unimodal setpoints from a single promoter. Through small-molecule control of transcription factors and recombinases, DIAL supports temporally defined, user-guided control of transgene expression that is extensible to additional transcription factors. Lentiviral delivery of DIAL generates multiple setpoints in primary cells and iPSCs. As promoter editing generates stable states, DIAL setpoints are heritable, facilitating mapping of transgene levels to phenotypes. The DIAL framework opens new opportunities for tailoring transgene expression and improving the predictability and performance of gene circuits across diverse applications.

HighlightsPromoter editing generates unimodal setpoints from a single synthetic promoter

DIAL setpoints are tuned by the length of an excisable spacer within the promoter

DIAL setpoints are uniform and robust to varying levels of the transcription factor

However, disruption of domain structure often results in mild gene dysregulation and thus predicting the impact of boundary rearrangements on animal development remains challenging. Here, we tested whether structural perturbation of a chromatin domain with multiple developmental regulators can result in more acute gene dysregulation and severe developmental phenotypes. We targeted clusters of CTCF motifs in a domain of the mouse genome containing three FGF ligand genes--Fgf3, Fgf4, and Fgf15--that regulate several developmental processes. Deletion of the 23.9kb cluster that defines the centromeric boundary of this domain resulted in ectopic interactions of the FGF genes with enhancers located across the deleted boundary that are active in the developing brain. This caused strong induction of FGF expression and perinatal lethality with encephalocele and orofacial cleft phenotypes. Heterozygous boundary deletion was sufficient to cause these fully penetrant phenotypes, and strikingly, loss of a single CTCF motif within the cluster also recapitulated ectopic FGF expression and caused encephalocele. However, such phenotypic sensitivity to perturbation of domain structure did not extend to all CTCF clusters of this domain, nor to all developmental processes controlled by these three FGF genes--for example, the ability to undergo lineage specification in the blastocyst and pre-implantation development were not affected. By tracing the impact of different chromosomal rearrangements throughout mouse development, we start to uncover the determinants of phenotypic robustness and sensitivity to perturbation of chromatin boundaries. Our data show how small sequence variants at certain domain boundaries can have a surprisingly outsized effect and must be considered as potential sources of gene dysregulation during development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Currently, holocephalian diversity is concentrated in deep-sea species, suggesting this lineage might contain relictual diversity that persisted in the ocean depths. Yet, the relationships of living holocephalians to their extinct relatives and the timescale of diversification of living species remains unclear. Here, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of holocephalians using comprehensive morphological and DNA sequence datasets. Our results suggest that living holocephalians entered and diversified in deep (>1000 m) ocean waters after the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, contrasting with the hypothesis that this ecosystem has acted as a refugium of ancient cartilaginous fishes. These invasions were decoupled from the evolution of key features of the holocephalian body plan, including crushing dentition, a single frontal clasper, and holostylic jaw suspension, in the Paleozoic Era, and considerably postdated the appearance of the living familes by 150 million years ago during a major period of biotic turnover in oceans termed the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. These results clarify the origins of living holocephalians as the recent diversification of a single surviving clade among numerous Paleozoic lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Combination immunotherapy is now standard of care for advanced HCC, improving patient outcomes. However, a considerable number of patients remain unresponsive, or are unable to tolerate therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as the former first-line agent sorafenib, remain an option for such patients, yet provide only marginal efficacy. We hypothesised that a clinically advanced immunogenic ""oncolytic"" virus, namely, human Orthoreovirus, might improve TKI mediated therapy. Surprisingly, uv-inactivated, replication-deficient reovirus, but not live virus, significantly extended survival when combined with sorafenib in preclinical immunocompetent HCC models. Favourable responses were dependent upon adaptive immunity, mediated by IFNB-induced skewing of the infiltrating T-cell ratio in favour of cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells expressing granzyme B and perforin. Interestingly, this subset effectively killed tumours via both contact juxtacrine and paracrine processes, the former being MHCII independent. Moreover, efficacy correlated with more rapid and robust IFN production by inactivated virus due to the absence of innate viral antagonists. Thus, we reveal a means to improve TKI-HCC outcomes through an alternative virus-driven immunotherapy, underpinned by non-classical immunological mechanisms.

IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONSImmune checkpoint immunotherapy is revolutionising cancer treatment, yet considerable numbers of patients still fail to respond and must resort to older, more toxic and less effective therapies, including Sorafenib for the management of HCC.

We demonstrate that burgeoning virus-driven immunotherapy can be successfully combined with Sorafenib to extend preclinical HCC survival, but only when the virus is uv-inactivated to prevent already attenuated innate immune antagonism, specifically increasing the magnitude of tumour IFNB responses. IFNB was essential to promote tumour infiltration of cytotoxic CD4+ cells during therapy, which was a hallmark of long-term survival mediated by ensuing adaptive responses.

We anticipate this work will be of interest to clinicians and cancer immunology researchers, promoting closer inspection of the immune microenvironment and cancer-specific responses to OV therapy, specifically those driven by non-canonical anti-cancer mechanisms involving IFNB and cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

The disease predominated in the grey nuclei of the rhombencephalon, a topography attributable to a local proliferative advantage of mutant microglia. Presence of clinical symptoms was associated with a longer evolution of the disease and a larger size of PU.1+ clones (p= 0.0003). Genetic lineage tracing of PU.1+ clones suggest a resident macrophage lineage or a bone marrow precursor origin depending on patients. Finally, a CSF1R-inhibitor depleted mutant microglia and limited neuronal loss in mice suggesting an alternative to MAPK inhibitors.

Here, we used a custom hippocampal microperiscope and two-photon calcium imaging to track CA1 pyramidal neurons in female mice over multiple cycles. Estrous cycle stage had a potent effect on spine dynamics, with heightened density during periods of greater estradiol (proestrus). These morphological changes were accompanied by greater somatodendritic coupling and increased infiltration of back-propagating action potentials into the apical dendrite.

To uncover the mechanisms underlying SAM development and its orign, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing technology in Physcomitrium patens, which contains a single stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We identified distinct cell clusters representing major cell types of the P. patens gametophyte, including the gametophore apical cells. We revealed dynamic gene expression changes during cell fate progression in the gametophore apical cell and found upregulation of cytokinin biosynthesis genes in this cell. We also identified ENHANCER OF SHOOT REGENERATION 1 (ESR1) orthologs as key regulators of gametophore apical cells downstream of cytokinin. Given that ESRs promote SAM formation under cytokinin in angiosperms, we propose that the cytokinin-ESR module represents a conserved mechanism promoting stem cell identity that evolved in the common ancestor of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

A key component of flexibility is down-regulating responding as valued cues and actions become decoupled from positive outcomes. We used array fiber photometry in mice to investigate how ACh release across the striatum evolves during learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations. Changes in multi-phasic release to cues and consummatory actions were bi-directional and region-specific. Following extinction, increases in cue-evoked ACh release emerged in the anterior dorsal striatum (aDS) which preceded a down-regulation of anticipatory behavior. Silencing ACh release from cholinergic interneurons in the aDS blocked behavioral extinction. Dopamine release dipped below baseline for down-shifted cues, but glutamate input onto cholinergic interneurons did not change, suggesting an intrastriatal mechanism for the emergence of ACh increases. Our large- scale mapping of striatal ACh dynamics during learning pinpoints region-specific elevations in ACh release positioned to down-regulate behavior during extinction, a central feature of flexible behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Extracted protein samples are compared to a standard curve made with dilutions of a protein standard such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) to determine their concentrations. A series of experiments was designed to determine the most reproducible and accurate method for quantifying protein concentrations of samples in an experimental series over time. The effect of freezing on diluted standards was investigated.

Specifically, we enter n variations of k pattern classes (n*k patterns) onto a cortex-like balanced inhibitory-excitatory network with heterogeneous neurons, and let the pattern spread within the recurrent network. We show that we can identify high mutual-information (MI) neurons as major information-bearing elements within each pattern representation. We employ a simple one-shot adaptive (learning) process focusing on high MI neurons and inhibition. Such  localist plasticity has high efficiency, because it requires only few adaptations for each pattern. Specifically, we store k=10 patterns of size s=400 in a 1000/1200 neuron network. We stimulate high MI neurons and in this way recall patterns, such that the whole network represents this pattern. We assess the quality of the representation (a) before learning, when entering the pattern into a naive network and (b) after learning, on the adapted network, during recall. The recalled patterns could be easily recognized by a trained classifier. The pattern  unfolds over the recurrent network with high similarity, albeit compressed, with respect to the original input pattern. We discuss the distribution of neuron properties in the network, and find that an initial Gaussian or uniform distribution changes into a more heavy-tailed, lognormal distribution during the adaptation process. The remarkable result is that we are able to achieve reliable pattern recall by stimulating only high information neurons.

We demonstrate that a single tree can host approximately a trillion microbes in its aboveground internal tissues, with microbial communities partitioned between heartwood and sapwood, each maintaining a distinct microbiome with minimal similarity to other plant tissues or nearby ecosystem components. Notably, the heartwood microbiome emerges as a unique ecological niche, distinguished in part by endemic archaea and anaerobic bacteria that drive consequential biogeochemical processes.

Model: We propose bootstrap evaluation of association matrices (BEAM), which integrates multiple omics profiles with multiple clinical endpoints. BEAM associates a set omic features with clinical endpoints via regression models and then uses bootstrap resampling to determine statistical significance of the set. Unlike existing methods, BEAM uniquely accommodates an arbitrary number of omic profiles and endpoints. Results: In simulations, BEAM performed similarly to the theoretically best simple test and outperformed other integrated analysis methods.

However, since late 2022, it has been reported elsewhere, from northern Brazil to urban centers in Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. In this report we describe the doubling of publicly available full genomes by generating 133 new entries. We show how the virus evolved via recombination and how it rapidly spread across multiple states in Brazil, causing the largest outbreak ever recorded outside the Amazon basin including the first ever detected deaths. This work highlights the need for heightened epidemiological and genomic surveillance and the implementation of adequate responses in order to avoid Oropouche becoming another widespread arboviral public health threat. Background: The Oropouche virus was first identified in 1955 in Trinidad and Tobago and later found in Brazil in 1960. Historically, it has been reported to have caused around 30 outbreaks, most of which within the Amazon Basin where it circulates among forest animals, but also in urban areas where it is known to be transmitted by the midge Culicoides paraensis. Recently, Brazil has seen a surge in cases, with 6000 reported by mid-2024 alone. Methods: In a collaboration with Central Public Health Laboratories across Brazilian regions, we integrated epidemiological metadata with genomic analyses of recently sampled cases. This initiative resulted in the generation of 133 whole genome sequences from the three genomic segments (L, M, and S) of the virus, including the first genomes obtained from regions outside the Amazon and from the first ever recorded fatal cases. Findings: All of the 2024 genomes form a monophyletic clade in the phylogenetic tree with sequences from the Amazon Basin sampled since 2022. Our analyses reveal a fast and clear pattern of north-to-south viral movement from the Amazon Basin into historically non-endemic regions. We identified 21 recombinant events, but it remains unclear if such genomic changes mirror potential adaptations and the emergence of new viral phenotypes of public health importance. Interpretation: Both the recent rapid spatial expansion and the first reported fatalities associated with Oropouche underscore the importance of enhancing surveillance at both national and continental levels.

Accumulation of the Arabidopsis NADPH oxidase RBOHD is regulated by phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal residue (T912) leading to ubiquitination by the RING E3 ligase PIRE. Arabidopsis PIRE knockouts exhibit enhanced ROS production and resistance to the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Here, we identified 170 PIRE homologs, which emerged in tracheophytes and expanded in angiosperms. We investigated the role of Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) PIRE homologs in regulating ROS production, RBOH stability, and disease resistance. Mutational analyses of residues corresponding to T912 in the tomato RBOHD ortholog, SlRBOHB, affected protein accumulation and ROS production in a PIRE-dependent manner. Using CRISPR-cas9, we generated mutants in two S. lycopersicum PIRE homologs (SlPIRE). SlPIRE1 edited lines (Slpire1) in the tomato cultivar M82 displayed enhanced ROS production upon treatment with flg22, an immunogenic epitope of flagellin. Furthermore, Slpire1 exhibited decreased disease symptoms and bacterial accumulation when inoculated with foliar bacterial pathogens Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris. However, Slpire1 exhibited similar levels of colonization as wild type upon inoculation with diverse soilborne pathogens. These results indicate that phosphorylation and ubiquitination crosstalk regulate RBOHs in multiple plant species, and PIRE is a promising target for foliar disease control. This study also highlights the pathogen-specific role of PIRE, indicating its potential for targeted manipulation to enhance foliar disease resistance without affecting root-associated interactions, positioning PIRE as a promising target for improving overall plant health.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

The ionizable lipid component within LNPs is critical to the efficient delivery of mRNA. Ionizable lipids can also trigger innate immune activation, which is beneficial for vaccine efficacy but may contribute to adverse inflammatory reactions. Engineering ionizable lipids for rapid biodegradation is a promising, yet underexplored, strategy to dampen inflammation. Here, we report the rational design and optimization of biodegradable ionizable lipids for intramuscular mRNA vaccines in mice. We show that in vivo biodegradability is enhanced by controlling lipid hydrolysis kinetics and that protein output is maximized by tuning the LNP apparent pKa. In an influenza vaccine model, the lead lipid ({delta}O3) generates equivalent neutralizing antibodies and stronger antigen-specific T cell responses compared to a benchmark lipid (SM-102) used in approved mRNA vaccines. Furthermore, by comparing ionizable lipid analogs with similar potency but opposing biodegradation kinetics, we find that faster lipid clearance from tissues coincides with a lower inflammatory response while preserving strong vaccine immunogenicity. These findings demonstrate that fast-degrading ionizable lipids can balance the efficacy and tolerability of mRNA vaccines, with implications for addressing side effects and patient acceptance of new vaccine applications.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

However, it is less clear if the same stimuli can induce both the protective and detrimental effects of innate immune memory. We previously showed that weight loss induces innate immune memory in adipose macrophages that correlates with worsened diabetes risk after weight regain. In this study, we investigated the effect of weight loss on macrophage cytokine production and overall survival in a mouse model of infection. Male C57Bl/6J mice were put on high-fat or low-fat diets over 18 weeks to induce weight gain or weight loss. Lean mice served as controls. All mice were then infected IV with 2.5x10^6 CFU Staphylococcus aureus. Tissues were collected from 10 mice/group at day 3 and the remaining animals were followed for survival. Weight gain mice had the highest blood neutrophils and the highest bacterial burden in the kidney. However, there was no significant difference in survival. The weight loss group had the highest plasma TNF- and a significant reduction in bacterial burden in the adipose tissue that correlated with increased adipose macrophage cytokine production. Thus, weight loss-induced adipose macrophage memory may both improve local S.aureus clearance and worsen diabetes risk upon weight regain. Collectively, these findings support the notion that innate immune memory is an evolutionarily protective mechanism that also contributes to the development of cardiometabolic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Current methods for inferring neural communication track patterns of sustained co-activation over time, making them unsuitable to detect discrete instances of signal transmission. Here, we propose Event-marked Windowed Communication (EWC), a new analytical framework to infer functional interactions arising from discrete signalling events between neural elements, in otherwise continuous time series data. In contrast to conventional measures of functional connectivity, our method utilises an event-based subsampling of neural time series, which allows it to capture the statistical analogue of activity propagation. We test EWC on simulations of neural dynamics and show that it is capable of retrieving ground truth motifs of directional signalling, over a range of model configurations. Critically, we demonstrate that EWCs subsampling approach affords profound reductions in computation times, compared to established network inference methods such as transfer entropy. Lastly, we showcase the utility of EWC to infer whole-brain functional networks from MEG recordings. Networks computed using EWC and transfer entropy were highly correlated (median r=0.821 across subjects), but EWC inference was approximately 6.5 times faster per epoch. In summary, our work presents a new method to infer signalling from time series of neural activity at low computational costs. Our framework is flexible and can be applied to activity time series captured by diverse functional neuroimaging modalities, opening up new avenues for the study of neural communication.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

In C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly vaccinated with mRNACV2, high frequencies of polyfunctional, antigen-specific Th1 CD4+ T cells were observed in the blood and lungs, which was associated with the rapid recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells to lymph nodes draining the site of immunisation. mRNACV2 vaccination provided significant pulmonary protection in M. tuberculosis-infected mice, reducing bacterial load and inflammatory infiltration in the lungs. As BCG is widely administered in infants in TB endemic countries, new TB vaccines should be able to boost the effects of BCG. Importantly, mRNACV2 enhanced immune responses and long-term protection when used to boost BCG-primed mice. These findings, which provide the first report of a highly protective LNP-mRNA vaccine for TB, highlight the potential of the LNP-mRNA platform for TB control and support further research to facilitate translation to humans.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

We show protrudin acts at ER-endosome contacts to promote ETF and endosome-to-Golgi traffic. Protrudin-mediated ETF required its ability to interact with ER-localised VAP proteins, endosomal phosphoinositides and KIF5. These properties also regulated the distance between protrudin and endosomal tubules. The defective ETF phenotype of increased endosomal tubulation in cells lacking protrudin was phenocopied by depletion of KIF5, but not FYCO1, a motor protein adaptor implicated in protrudin-dependent late endosome motility. It also required intact microtubules and dynein, consistent with a model where protrudin facilitates a tug-of-war between KIF5 and dynein to fission tubules. In addition to its direct role, protrudin links many other machineries involved in ETF, thus our findings elucidate how ETF is co-ordinated. These machineries are enriched for proteins implicated in hereditary motor neuron disorders, and protrudin or KIF5 depletion caused defective ETF in human neurons.

SummaryProtrudin binds ER-localised VAPs and endosomal phosphoinositides to form ER-endosome contacts that promote endosomal tubule fission and endosome-to-Golgi traffic.

While this framework is well-suited for hypothesis testing approaches, achieving the modern goal of precision medicine requires a different framework that is predictive in nature and that focuses on maximizing the predictive power of models and evaluating their ability to generalize beyond the data that were used to train them. However, few tools exist to support the development and evaluation of predictive models in the context of neuroimaging or lesion-behavior research, creating an obstacle to the widespread adoption of predictive modeling approaches in the field. Further, existing tools for lesion-behavior analysis are often unable to accommodate categorical outcome variables and often impose restrictions on the predictor data. Researchers therefore often must use different software packages and analytical approaches depending on whether they are addressing a classification vs. regression problem and on whether their predictor data correspond to binary lesion images, continuous lesion-network images, connectivity matrices, or other data modalities. To address these limitations, we have developed a MATLAB software toolkit that supports both inferential and predictive modeling frameworks, accommodates both classification and regression problems, and does not impose restrictions on the modality of the predictor data. The toolkit features both a graphical user interface and scripting interface, includes implementations of multiple mass-univariate, multivariate, and machine learning models, features built-in and customizable routines for hyper-parameter optimization, cross-validation, model stacking, and significance testing, and automatically generates text-based descriptions of key methodological details and modeling results to improve reproducibility and minimize errors in the reporting of methods and results. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of the toolkits features and demonstrate its functionality by applying it to the question of how expressive and receptive language impairments relate to lesion location, structural disconnection, and functional network disruption in a large sample of patients with left hemispheric brain lesions. We find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are most strongly associated with left lateral prefrontal and left posterior temporal/parietal damage, respectively. We also find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are associated with partially overlapping patterns of fronto-temporal structural disconnection, and that the associated functional networks are also similar. Importantly, we find that lesion location and lesion-derived network measures are highly predictive of both types of impairment, with predictions from models trained on these measures explaining [~]30-40% of the variance on average when applied to data from patients not used to train the models. We have made the toolkit publicly available, and we have included a comprehensive set of tutorial notebooks to support new users in applying the toolkit in their studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Formate, which can be efficiently produced from CO2, shows great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biotechnological production. However, the scope of formate assimilation pathways is restricted by the limited number of natural formate-assimilating enzymes. To overcome this limitation, several new-to-nature routes for formate assimilation based on its reduction to formaldehyde have been proposed, but they suffer from low catalytic efficiencies and cannot yet support bacterial growth. Here, we propose the Serine Shunt as a novel formate reduction route and demonstrate its activity in vivo. In this pathway, formate is attached to glycine to form serine, which is subsequently cleaved into formaldehyde and glycine, thereby effectively converting formate to formaldehyde. Unlike other formate reduction routes, the Serine Shunt mainly utilizes natural reactions with favorable enzyme kinetics, while requiring the same amount of ATP and NAD(P)H as the most efficient new-to-nature route. We implemented the Serine Shunt in engineered E. coli strains using a step-wise approach by dividing the pathway into metabolic modules. After validating the individual module activities, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of the complete Serine Shunt by measuring intracellular formaldehyde production with a GFP sensor and coupling its activity to cell growth.

Adults with immunosuppression (e.g., solid organ transplant recipients) and those undergoing active cancer treatments experience worse infections and more severe COVID-19. It is difficult to conduct clinical studies in these populations, resulting in a restricted amount of data that can be used to relate mechanisms of immune dysfunction to COVID-19 outcomes in these vulnerable groups. To study immune dynamics after infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to investigate drivers of COVID-19 severity in individuals with cancer and immunosuppression, we adapted our mathematical model of the immune response during COVID-19 and generated virtual patient cohorts of cancer and immunosuppressed patients. The cohorts of plausible patients recapitulated available longitudinal clinical data collected from patients in Montreal, Canada area hospitals. Our model predicted that both cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients with severe COVID-19 had decreased CD8+ T cells, elevated interleukin-6 concentrations, and delayed type I interferon peaks compared to those with mild COVID-19 outcomes. Additionally, our results suggest that cancer patients experience higher viral loads (however, with no direct relation with severity), likely because of decreased initial neutrophil counts (i.e., neutropenia), a frequent toxic side effect of anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, severe cancer and immunosuppressed virtual patients suffered a high degree of tissue damage associated with elevated neutrophils. Lastly, parameter values associated with monocyte recruitment by infected cells were found to be elevated in severe cancer and immunosuppressed patients with respect to the COVID-19 reference group. Together, our study highlights that dysfunction in type I interferon and CD8+ T cells are key drivers of immune dysregulation in COVID-19, particularly in cancer patients and immunosuppressed individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

While it has been observed that some cell types are far more evolutionarily conserved than others, the factors driving these differences in evolutionary rate remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that highly abundant neuronal cell types may be under greater selective constraint than rarer neuronal types, leading to variation in their rates of evolution. To test this, we leveraged recently published cross-species single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets from three distinct regions of the mammalian neocortex. We found a strikingly consistent relationship where more abundant neuronal subtypes show greater gene expression conservation between species, which replicated across three independent datasets covering >1,000,000 neurons from six species. Based on this principle, we discovered that the most abundant type of neocortical neurons-layer 2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons-has evolved exceptionally quickly in the human lineage compared to other apes. Surprisingly, this accelerated evolution was accompanied by the dramatic down-regulation of autism-associated genes, which was likely driven by polygenic positive selection specific to the human lineage. In sum, we introduce a general principle governing neuronal evolution and suggest that the exceptionally high prevalence of autism in humans may be a direct result of natural selection for lower expression of a suite of genes that conferred a fitness benefit to our ancestors while also rendering an abundant class of neurons more sensitive to perturbation.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

To investigate the basis for species-specific developmental tempo, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of protein dynamics in mouse and human neural progenitors (NPs). Through a combination of targeted protein labelling, quantitative mass spectrometry, and protein depletion with self-labeling tags, we demonstrate that protein degradation is a key driver of tempo differences between mouse and human NPs. We observe a systematic 1.5-fold increase in protein half-lives in human NPs compared to mouse, independent of cellular compartment or protein function. This difference persists in post-mitotic neurons, indicating active degradation as the primary mechanism. Proteasomal activity is also [~]1.5-fold higher in mouse NPs, consistent with upregulation of proteasome-associated proteins. Importantly, increasing the rate of proteolytic degradation of a key transcriptional repressor in neural progenitors accelerates the expression of its target gene. Despite differences in degradation rates, protein synthesis rates are similar between species, resulting in higher protein content in human NPs. Our findings highlight the central role of protein degradation in controlling developmental tempo and provide insight into the molecular basis of evolutionary changes in developmental timing across species.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Their identification is critical to study the transcriptional regulation of genes controlling key traits that govern plant growth and development. They are also crucial components for the delineation of gene regulatory networks, which represent regulatory interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes. In maize, CREs have been profiled using different computational and experimental methods, but the extent to which these methods complement each other in identifying functional CREs is unclear. Here, we report the data-driven integration of different maize CRE profiling methods to optimize the capture of experimentally-confirmed TF binding sites, resulting in maps of integrated CREs (iCREs) showing increased levels of completeness and precision. We combined the iCREs with a wide diversity of gene expression data under drought conditions to perform motif enrichment and infer drought-specific GRNs. Mining these organ-specific GRNs revealed previously characterized and novel candidate regulators of maize drought response. Furthermore, by studying the transposable elements (TEs) overlapping with iCREs, we identified few TE superfamilies displaying typical epigenetic features of regulatory DNA that are potentially involved in wiring specific TF-target gene regulatory interactions. Overall, our study showcases the integration of different omics data sources to generate a high-quality collection of CREs, together with their applicability to better characterize gene regulation in the complex maize genome.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

In this study, we successfully reproduced the DIANA response in medetomidine-anesthetized mice using forelimb electrical stimulation at 11.7 T. More importantly, we showed that multiple neural circuits can be effectively revealed by DIANA fMRI through spatiotemporal activation mapping. The spatiotemporal activation mapping proposed here utilizes the temporal information of the DIANA response, that is, the time when the DIANA response reaches its peak, which is a unique feature that distinguishes it from the activation mapping method used in existing fMRI. Based on DIANA activation areas, we identified several neural circuits involved in forelimb sensory processing in the somatosensory network, which includes multiple brain regions: ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL), posteromedial thalamic nucleus (POm), forelimb primary somatosensory cortex (S1FL), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), primary motor cortex (M1), and secondary motor cortex (M2). Additionally, we also identified a pain-related neural circuit involving brain regions of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Interestingly, the spatiotemporal activation mapping also allowed us to identify subregions with different DIANA response times within the same functional region (e.g., VPL, POm, S1FL, and S2). Our study highlights the potential of DIANA fMRI to advance our understanding of sensory information processing throughout the brain and to provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks at the level of neural circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Hearing loss is one such early indicator linked to many comorbidities later in life. However, current clinical tests fail to capture hearing difficulties for ~10% of middle-aged adults seeking help at hearing clinics. Cochlear neural degeneration (CND) could play a role in these hearing deficits, but our current understanding is limited by the lack of objective diagnostics and uncertainty regarding its perceptual consequences. Here, using a cross-species approach, we measured envelope following responses (EFRs) - neural ensemble responses to sound originating from the peripheral auditory pathway - in young and middle-aged adults with normal audiometric thresholds, and compared these responses to young and middle-aged Mongolian gerbils, where CND was histologically confirmed. We observed near identical changes in EFRs across species that were associated with CND. Perceptual effects measured as behavioral readouts showed deficits in the most challenging listening conditions and were associated with CND. Additionally, pupil-indexed listening effort increased even at moderate task difficulties where behavioral outcomes were matched. Our results reveal perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults driven by CND and increases in listening effort, which may result in increased listening fatigue and conversational disengagement.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

However, current deep learning-based DNPD approaches are often limited by their focus on specific or narrowly defined protein designs, restricting broader exploration and the discovery of diverse, functional proteins. To address this issue, we introduce Pinal, a probabilistic sampling method that generates protein sequences using rich natural language as guidance. Unlike end-to-end text-to-sequence generation approaches, we employ a two-stage generative process. Initially, we generate structures based on given language instructions, followed by designing sequences conditioned on both the structure and the language. This approach facilitates searching within the smaller structure space rather than the vast sequence space. Experiments demonstrate that Pinal outperforms existing models, including the concurrent work ESM3, and can generalize to novel protein structures outside the training distribution when provided with appropriate instructions. This work aims to aid the biological community by advancing the design of novel proteins, and our code will be made publicly available soon.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Epigenetic clocks have emerged as promising tools for estimating biological age, yet so far, most of these clocks have been developed from heterogeneous bulk tissues, and are thus composites of two aging processes, one reflecting the change of cell-type composition with age and another reflecting the aging of individual cell-types. There is thus a need to dissect and quantify these two components of epigenetic clocks, and to develop epigenetic clocks that can yield biological age estimates at cell-type resolution. Here we demonstrate that in blood and brain, approximately 35% of an epigenetic clocks accuracy is driven by underlying shifts in lymphocyte and neuronal subsets, respectively. Using brain and liver tissue as prototypes, we build and validate neuron and hepatocyte specific DNA methylation clocks, and demonstrate that these cell-type specific clocks yield improved estimates of chronological age in the corresponding cell and tissue-types. We find that neuron and glia specific clocks display biological age acceleration in Alzheimers Disease with the effect being strongest for glia in the temporal lobe. The hepatocyte clock is found accelerated in liver under various pathological conditions. In contrast, non-cell-type specific clocks do not display biological age-acceleration, or only do so more marginally. In summary, this work highlights the importance of dissecting epigenetic clocks and quantifying biological age at cell-type resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

This dual role remains an enduring enigma. While there have been advances in modeling spatial representations in the hippocampus, we lack good models of its role in episodic memory. Here we present a neocortical-entorhinal-hippocampal network model that implements a high-capacity general associative memory, spatial memory, and episodic memory by factorizing content storage from the dynamics of generating error-correcting stable states. Unlike existing neural memory models, which exhibit a memory cliff, the circuit (which we call Vector-HaSH, Vector Hippocampal Scaffolded Heteroassociative Memory) exhibits a graceful tradeoff between number of stored items and detail. Next, we show that structured internal scaffold states are essential for constructing episodic memory: they enable high-capacity sequence memorization by abstracting the chaining problem into one of learning low-dimensional transitions. Finally, we show that previously learned spatial sequences in the form of cortico-hippocampal location-landmark associations can in turn be used as larger scaffolds and associated with neocortical inputs for a high-fidelity one-shot memory, providing the first circuit model of the ""memory palaces"" used in the striking feats of memory athletes.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

A commonly adopted approach to reconstruct complex demographic dynamics is the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) framework. It exploits coalescent simulations to generate the expected level of variation under different evolutionary scenarios. Demographic inference is then performed by comparing the simulated data with the genotypes called in the sampled individuals. Low sequencing coverage drastically affects the ability to reliably call genotypes, thus making low-coverage data unsuitable for such powerful inferential approaches. Here, we present Low-ABC, a new ABC approach to infer past population processes using low-coverage whole-genome data. Under this framework, both observed and simulated genetic variation are not directly compared using called genotypes, but rather obtained using genotype likelihoods to consider the uncertainty caused by the low sequencing coverage. We first evaluated the inferential power of this procedure in distinguishing among different demographic models and in inferring model parameters under different experimental conditions, including a wide spectrum of sequencing coverage (1x to 30x), number of individuals, number, and size of genetic loci. We showed that the use of genotype likelihoods integrated into an ABC framework provides a reliable inference of past population dynamics, thus making possible the application of model-based inference also for low-coverage data. We then applied Low-ABC to shed light on the relationship between Mesolithic and Early Neolithic European populations.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

However, the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. A better understanding of the role of aging in liver and other cancers can facilitate approaches for risk assessment, early detection and prevention. We hypothesize that age-driven changes render aged liver more sensitive to oncogenic stress and hence tumorigenesis. To investigate how the liver changes with age, we documented the immune profile, transcriptome and epigenome of healthy livers from both young and aged mice, revealing pronounced alterations with aging. Notably, in aged hepatocytes, we identified heightened interferon (IFN) signaling, as well as simultaneous tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling at both bulk and single cell level, suggestive of an aged liver that is poised for neoplasia. To challenge this seemingly poised state, we employed adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of a c-Myc oncogene in young and aged mouse liver hepatocytes in vivo. Analysis of aged hepatocytes expressing c-Myc revealed further elevated expression of IFN Stimulated Genes (ISGs). This ISG upregulation was evident in multiple models of oncogenic stress and transformation in older mice and also observed in aged humans with Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). We determined that Stat1 is both necessary and sufficient for the age specific elevated ISG expression in old wild type mice. Remarkably, inhibiting Jak/Stat signaling alongside ectopic c-Myc expression led to high-grade hepatocyte dysplasia and tumor formation, selectively in aged mice. Together, these results suggest that an aged liver is in a state of ''precarious balance'', due to concurrent activation of oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways, but protected against neoplastic progression by IFN-signaling. Age-dependent activation of IFN signaling has been observed in many tissues and recent studies have demonstrated its detrimental consequences on aging, raising the question as to why IFN signaling is activated during aging. We propose that aged tissues are intrinsically at higher risk of cancer and age-dependent activation of IFN-signaling is an adaptive process to protect from tumorigenesis, but one that also has maladaptive consequences.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

We first model the mean species abundance with a simple consumer-resource model, which is then extended into two multi-species frameworks for community dynamics: a neutral model, which emphasises the ability of any species to recover independently of the others; and a non-neutral one, where species interactions play an important role in reconstructing ecosystem's structure and patterns. The results indicate that, while both frameworks accurately describe correlation functions and mean-variance relations, the non-neutral model more effectively captures community structure as revealed by an evenness indicator. This suggests that interspecific interactions significantly influence the ecosystem's ability to respond to disturbances, providing deeper insights into the recovery dynamics of forest ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Humans know this, and so do some non-human animals like macaque monkeys. When monkeys report more confidence in a perceptual decision, that decision is more likely to be correct. It is not known how neural circuits in the primate brain assess the quality of perceptual decisions. Here, we test two hypotheses. First, that decision confidence is related to the structure of population activity in sensory cortex. And second, that this relation differs from the one between sensory activity and decision content. We trained macaque monkeys to judge the orientation of ambiguous stimuli and additionally report their confidence in these judgments. We recorded population activity in the primary visual cortex and used decoders to expose the relationship between this activity and the choice-confidence reports. Our analysis validated both hypotheses and suggests that perceptual decisions arise from a neural computation downstream of visual cortex that estimates the most likely interpretation of a sensory response, while decision confidence instead reflects a computation that evaluates whether this sensory response will produce a reliable decision. Our work establishes a direct link between neural population activity in sensory cortex and the metacognitive ability to introspect about the quality of perceptual decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

We characterized Ab1456 and Ab1271, two heterologously-neutralizing antibodies elicited in non-human primates by priming with an engineered V3-targeting SOSIP Env immunogen and boosting with increasingly native-like SOSIP Envs derived from different strain backgrounds. Structures of Env trimers in complex with these antibodies revealed V3 targeting, but on conformational states of Env distinct from the typical closed, prefusion trimeric SOSIP structure. Env trimers bound by Ab1456 adopted conformations resembling CD4-bound open Env states in the absence of soluble CD4, whereas trimers bound by Ab1271 exhibited a trimer apex-altered conformation to accommodate antibody binding. The finding that elicited antibodies cross-neutralized by targeting altered, non-closed, prefusion Env trimer conformations provides important information about Env dynamics that is relevant for HIV-1 vaccine design aimed at raising antibodies to desired epitopes on closed pre-fusion Env trimers.

Highlights- Sequential immunization regimen elicits V3 antibodies targeting non-closed Envs
- Cryo-EM structures reveal recognition of multiple Env conformational states
- Neutralization by elicited antibody does not require antibody-virus preincubation

Despite extensive data from consortia like ENCODE, understanding the dynamics of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in gene expression remains challenging. Deep learning is a powerful tool for learning gene expression and epigenomic signals from DNA sequences, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional machine learning approaches. However, even the most advanced deep learning-based methods may fall short in capturing the regulatory effects of distal elements such as enhancers, limiting their predictive accuracy. In addition, these methods may require significant resources to train or to adapt to newly generated data. To address these challenges, we present EPInformer, a scalable deep-learning framework for predicting gene expression by integrating promoter-enhancer interactions with their sequences, epigenomic signals, and chromatin contacts.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Beyond well-studied plants and cyanobacteria, many bacteria use Rubisco for chemolithoautotrophy in extreme environments on Earth. Here, we characterized the diversity of chemolithoautotrophic Rubiscos in subzero environments. First, we surveyed subzero environments and found that the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was the most prevalent chemolithoautotrophic pathway. Second, we uncovered potential for chemolithoautotrophy in metagenomes from two distinct subzero, hypersaline Arctic environments: 40-kyr relic marine brines encased within permafrost (cryopeg brines) and first-year sea ice. Again, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was the dominant chemolithoautotrophic pathway in both environments, though with different Rubisco forms. From cryopeg brine, we reconstructed four metagenome-assembled genomes with the potential for chemolithoautotrophy, of which the sulfur-oxidizing genus Thiomicrorhabdus was most abundant. A broader survey of Thiomicrorhabdus genomes from diverse environments identified a core complement of three Rubisco forms (II, IAc, IAq) with distinct patterns of gain and loss. We developed a model framework and compared these different Rubisco forms across [CO2], [O2], and temperature. We found that form II outcompetes form I at low O2, but cold temperatures minimize this advantage. However, further inspection of form II from cold environments uncovered signals of thermal adaptation of key amino acids which resulted in a more exposed active site. These modifications suggest that these form II Rubisco proteins may have unique kinetics or thermal stability. This work can help address the limits of autotrophic functionality in extreme environments on Earth and other planetary bodies.

ImportanceAutotrophy, or the fixation of inorganic carbon to biomass, is a key factor in lifes ability to thrive on Earth. Research on autotrophy has focused on plants and algae, but many bacteria are also autotrophic and can survive and thrive under more extreme conditions. These bacteria are a window to past autotrophy on Earth, as well as potential autotrophy in extreme environments elsewhere in the Universe. Our study focused on dark, cold, saline environments, which are likely to be found on Enceladus and Europa, as well as in the Martian subsurface. We found compelling evidence of cold adaptation in a key autotrophic enzyme, Rubisco, which could expand the known boundaries of autotrophy in rapidly disappearing icy environments on Earth. We also present a novel model framework that can be used to probe the limits of autotrophy not only on Earth but also on key astrobiological targets like Enceladus and Europa.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

In vitro, SADS-CoV can infect cell lines from many different species, including humans, highlighting its high zoonotic potential. Coronavirus spike glycoproteins play a critical role in viral entry and are involved in determining viral host range and cellular tropism. Here, we used experimental evolution to investigate how the SADS-CoV spike protein adapts to human cells and to identify potential variants with increased infectivity. We evolved a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SADS-CoV spike (rVSV-SADS) in three human cell lines. After ten passages, increased viral replication was observed, and spike mutations were identified by sequencing. Mutations were functionally characterized in terms of viral fitness, spike processing and fusogenicity. Our results thus identify potential human-adaptive mutations in the SADS-CoV spike that may further enhance its zoonotic potential.

ImportanceCoronavirus transmission from animals represents a serious threat to humans. Pigs are of particular concern because of their proximity to humans and the several coronaviruses they harbor. In particular, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a recently identified highly pathogenic porcine coronavirus that has a very broad tropism in vitro, highlighting its high zoonotic risk. The coronavirus spike protein is a strong determinant of species tropism, and spike mutations may facilitate cross-species transmission. Here, to identify potential variants with increased ability to enter human cells, we used an experimental evolution approach to study how the SADS-CoV spike adapts to different human cell lines. These mutations, should they occur in nature, could potentially increase the zoonotic potential of SADS-CoV.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

However, there are few convincing modifiable factors for PCa and little is known about their potential interaction with genetic risk. We analyzed incident PCa cases (n=6,155) and controls (n=98,257) of European and African ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to evaluate the role of neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES)-and how it may interact with PRS-on PCa risk.

MethodsWe evaluated a multi-ancestry PCa PRS containing 269 genetic variants to understand the association of germline genetics with PCa in UKB. Using the English Indices of Deprivation, a set of validated metrics that quantify lack of resources within geographical areas, we performed logistic regression to investigate the main effects and interactions between nSES deprivation, PCa PRS, and PCa.

ResultsThe PCa PRS was strongly associated with PCa (OR=2.04; 95%CI=2.00-2.09; P<0.001). Additionally, nSES deprivation indices were inversely associated with PCa: employment (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001), education (OR=0.94; 95%CI=0.83-0.98; P<0.001), health (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001), and income (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001). The PRS effects showed little heterogeneity across nSES deprivation indices, except for the Townsend Index (P=0.03).

ConclusionsWe reaffirmed genetics as a risk factor for PCa and identified nSES deprivation domains that influence PCa detection and are potentially correlated with environmental exposures that are a risk factor for PCa. These findings also suggest that nSES and genetic risk factors for PCa act independently.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

The ventral subiculum (vSUB) emerges as a site where stress may induce sexually dimorphic adaptations due to its sex-specific organization and pivotal role in stress integration.

To address this, myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes, and electrically paced (3 h/day, 4 days @ 14 V). CCA evoked an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in stimulated vs. non-stimulated (CON) myotubes as expected. EVs were isolated from conditioned media from control and stimulated myotubes using differential ultracentrifugation and characterized biophysically using tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS, Exoid), TEM and western blotting. TEM images confirmed isolated round-shaped vesicles of about 30 - 150 nm with an intact lipid bilayer. The mean size of EVs ranged from 98 -138 nm, and was not altered by CCA. Zeta potential and total EV protein yield remained unchanged between groups, and total EV secretion increased after 4 days of CCA. Concomitant analysis of EVs after each day of CCA also demonstrated a progressive increase in CCA-EV concentration, while size and zeta potential remained unaltered, and EV protein yield increased in both CON-EVs and CCA groups. CCA-EVs were enriched with small-EVs vs. CON-EVs, concomitant with higher expression of small-EV markers CD81, Tsg101 and HSP70. In whole cell lysates, CD63 and ApoA1 were reduced with CCA in myotubes, whereas CD81, Tsg101, Flotillin-1 and HSP70 levels remained unchanged. To evaluate the functional effect of EVs secreted post-CCA, we treated C2C12 myoblasts with all EVs isolated from CON or CCA myotubes after each day of stimulation, and measured cell count, cell viability, protein yield and mitochondrial biogenesis in recipient cells. There was no effect on cell count, viability and protein yield. Myoblasts treated with CCA-EVs exhibited increased mitochondrial biogenesis as indicated by enhanced MitoTracker Red staining, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and protein expression of electron transport chain subunit, CIV-MTCO1. Further, CCA-EV treatment enhanced maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCR), and ATP production in treated myoblasts. This increase in maximal OCR was abrogated when CCA-EVs pre-treated with proteinase K were co-cultured with myoblasts, indicating the pro-metabolic effect was likely mediated by transmembrane or peripheral membrane proteins in CCA-EVs. Our data highlight the novel effect of Skm-EVs isolated post-CCA in mediating pro-metabolic effects in recipient cells and thereby transmitting the effects associated with traditional exercise. Further investigation to interrogate the underlying mechanisms involved in downstream cellular metabolic adaptations is warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

However, the results of radiotherapy can vary widely across different cancer types and even among patients with the same type of cancer. This variability presents a major challenge in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient survival. Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

Querying 1,375 genomes of the species-rich Malawi cichlid fish radiation, we discovered five large inversions segregating in the benthic subradiation that each suppress recombination over more than half a chromosome. Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon via admixture, while the others established early in the deep benthics. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage and a striking excess of protein changing substitutions pointing towards selection on sensory, behavioural and reproductive genes. We conclude that repeated interplay between depth adaptation and sex-specific selection on large inversions has been central to the evolution of this iconic system.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722895642373

This review examines trends in SCD among pilots from a global perspective, analyzing evidence from 2011 to 2023, with a focus on its growing impact as a global crisis and recent findings pointing to a potential rise in incidence, particularly after 2019.

ObjectivesTo analyze the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention strategies for SCD in pilots, particularly post-COVID-19.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines for systematic meta-analysis was used, a search of peer-reviewed literature for international aviation databases, and pilot associations was conducted to identify relevant data. The analysis focused on trends in SCD prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and recent findings, including the potential impact of COVID-19, the role of vaccination, and important biomarkers to screen for predisposition. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting SCD incidence, risk factors, or prevention strategies in pilots. Data were extracted, and meta-analyses conducted.

ResultsRecent studies suggest a potential increase in SCD incidence among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular complications, increased stress, disruptions in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle may contribute to this potential rise. Identified risk factors include age, male gender, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

Biomarkers such as troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been identified as potential indicators of increased SCD risk in pilots. Preventive measures include regular cardiovascular assessments and lifestyle modifications.

ConclusionSCD remains a significant and rising threat to pilots, posing a global crisis that requires immediate attention. Through a comprehensive approach that includes risk assessment, preventive measures, emergency response, and preventive protocols, the aviation industry can mitigate this risk and safeguard the lives of pilots and passengers.

This review also suggests standardized examination protocol for pilots includes regular cardiovascular risk assessment, biomarker screening, monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination status, lifestyle modifications, and a standardized reporting system. The adoption of a standardized protocol by aviation regulatory bodies and airlines worldwide is crucial to address the growing threat of SCD among pilots and ensure the highest standards of aviation safety.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722895642373

Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity.
