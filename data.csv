This study focused on intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), distinguishing their origin as either within-host mutations or parental. The whole genome analysis revealed accelerated evolution, with positive selection detected in key genes such as Spike, N, ORF9b, and nsp13, all involved in viral replication and immune evasion. Of the two evolutionary mechanisms involved, host-driven mutation has played a dominant role in this evolutionary story. C>T transitions emerged as the most widespread mutational signature, consistent with host-driven RNA editing mechanisms. Two host-internal mutations, A28271T in the translation initiation region of the N Kozak gene and C26858T in the M gene, were highly shared among the deposited SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Recombination with parental lineages played a major role particularly in Spike, ORF3a and M genes. In Spike, the B.1.1.7 sequence was selected, wild-type ORF3a and M were restored, suggesting a selective advantage in returning to an ancestral sequence. In addition, the temporary emergence of intra-host convergent mutations in Spike, notably L5F, D796H and T572I, underlines the strong selective pressures exerted on this gene. A 126-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 resulted in a truncated protein, reinforcing its uselessness for viral replication, as observed in circulating variants such as B.1.1.7. The present case highlights the complex interplay between viral recombination and mutations within the host in chronic infections and further underscores the remarkable evolutionary plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to generate highly adapted viral strains.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Here, we performed large-scale shotgun metagenomic sequencing on 1,889 individuals from rural Honduras, providing the most comprehensive microbiome dataset from Central America. We identify a distinct microbial composition enriched in Prevotella species, with 861 previously unreported bacterial species. Functional profiling reveals unique carbohydrate metabolism adaptations consistent with high-fiber diets. Longitudinal analysis over two years reveals microbiome instability, with shifts in taxonomic diversity and metabolic potential, including changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we characterize the gut virome and eukaryotic microbiome, identifying novel viral taxa, including Crassvirales phages, and a high prevalence of Blastocystis species in individuals with greater microbial diversity. Finally, by integrating host genomic data obtained from low-pass saliva whole-genome sequencing, we uncover significant host-microbiome associations, highlighting the influence of human genetic variation on microbial composition. People who are more genetically similar also have more similar gut microbiomes. These findings expand our understanding of microbiome diversity in non-industrialized populations, highlighting the uniqueness of those microbiomes and underscoring the need for global microbiome research.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Some of those symptoms could be related to autonomic dysfunction. Our aim is to evaluate the prevalence of autonomic dysfunction in long COVID patients.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study and included all consecutive patients enrolled in several clinical research studies. We performed the following autonomic dysfunction markers: heart rate variability, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes during NASA lean test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a COMPASS-31 scale. We used linear regression to calculate the contribution of each dysautonomia measure on symptom burden as measured by the modified COVID-19 Yorkshire scale.

ResultsWe included 100 patients for this study. Our sample had a mean age of 56+/-11 years, included 53% minorities and 32% were women. Dysautonomia as defined by an abnormal COMPASS-31 was seen in 82%; 95% 72-89 while cardiovascular resting dysautonomia as represented by an abnormal heart rate variability was seen in 60%; 95% 48-70 of the population, orthostatic hypotension in 12% and POTS in 10%. In our adjusted analysis, we found that the beta coefficient for the COMPASS-31 score (0.37) was significant on changes in a self-reported long COVID symptom burden. The orthostatic intolerance and gastrointestinal domains of the COMPASS-31 was associated the highest long COVID symptom burden.

ConclusionDysautonomia is common in long COVID patients and contributes to the overall symptoms seen in long COVID. Identifying dysautonomia has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoter's ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Heterochromatin erosion is a hallmark of human ageing and H3K9me3 is lost globally in aged mammalian cells. However, the functional consequences of the loss of heterochromatin maintenance have been challenging to model. In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Herein, we report the clinical and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections from 179 individuals (total 185 positive samples) residing in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance (KHDSS) area ([~]900 km2). Sixteen SARS-CoV-2 lineages within three sub-variants (XBB.2.3-like (58.4%), JN.1-like (40.5%) and XBB.1-like (1.1%)) were identified. Symptomatic infection rate was estimated at 16.0% (95% CI 11.1%-23.9%) based on community testing regardless of symptom status, and did not differ across the sub-variants (p = 0.13). The most common infection symptoms in community cases were cough (49.2%), fever (27.0%), sore throat (7.3%), headache (6.9%), and difficulty in breathing (5.5%) and one case succumbed to the infection. Genomic analysis of the virus from serial positives samples confirmed repeat infections among five participants under follow-up (median interval 21 days, range 16-95 days); in four participants, the same virus lineage was responsible in both the first and second infections, while one participant had a different lineage in the second infection compared to the first. Phylogenetic analysis including >18,000 contemporaneous global sequences estimated that at least 38 independent virus introduction events occurred into the KHDSS area during the wave, the majority likely originating in North America and Europe. Our study highlights coastal Kenya, like most other localities, continues to face new SARS-CoV-2 infection waves characterized by the circulation of new variants, multiple lineage importations and reinfections. Locally the virus may circulate unrecognized as most infections are asymptomatic in part due to high population immunity after several waves of infection. Our findings highlight the need for sustained SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to inform appropriate public health responses such as scheduled vaccination for risk populations.

Author summarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has transitioned to an endemic respiratory pathogen causing seasonal outbreaks. We examined the epidemiological and genomic patterns of a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in coastal Kenya that occurred between November 2023 and March 2024. By analyzing genetic and epidemiological data from positive cases in Kilifi, we inferred the origins of the new strains, documented repeat infections and the virus ongoing evolution. Our data revealed several variants circulating in the community, indicating multiple new virus introductions probably before and during local outbreaks. Many infected individuals were asymptomatic, highlighting unnoticed transmission within the population. Despite low vaccination rates among the cases ([~]7.0%), high population immunity has previously been reported locally. The common symptoms among those who were symptomatic included cough, fever, and sore throat. A few participants experienced repeat infections during the wave, often involving closely related strains. The virus lineages detected were most closely related to those sampled in Europe. Our findings emphasize that, despite the end of the emergency phase, SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant public health issue, necessitating ongoing monitoring and responsive measures e.g. target vaccinations, masking and good hygiene practices to protect those at risk of severe infection.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

Historically, research has prioritized protists associated with animals and plants, particularly those of medical significance, thereby overlooking the majority of protist diversity. Conventional molecular methods, such as 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, frequently encounter limitations, including primer binding bias and PCR bias caused by gene length variations, creating a biased perspective of understudied protistan diversity. Further, most protist lineages are notoriously difficult to cultivate. Here, we apply a cultivation-independent approach in which we analyzed over 27,000 assembled metagenomes and protist single cell genomes and 21 long 18S rRNA gene amplicon data sets from various global ecosystems, including marine, freshwater, and soil environments. We recovered 157,958 18S rRNA gene sequences ([&ge;]800 bp), which clustered into 103,338 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity and 24,438 OTUs at 85% identity. Notably, 69% of 13,238 non-singleton clusters at 85% identity consisted exclusively of environmental sequences, uncovering a wealth of yet uncultivated and unclassified novel protist diversity. A comprehensive taxonomic framework of eukaryotes based on concatenated 18S and 28S rRNA genes that incorporated most novel lineages revealed substantial underrepresentation of Amoebozoa, Discoba, and Rhizaria in reference databases, with many lacking isolate or genome sequence representation. Further, we identified 13 eukaryotic lineages with novelty on higher taxonomic ranks, such as class and phylum-level, that lack representation in public databases. The corresponding 85% OTUs were primarily affiliated with Excavata, with some branching closely to the root of the eukaryotic tree. Comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of eukaryotes revealed uneven microbial eukaryotic diversity across supergroups and ecosystems, with notable novelty particularly in soil and marine environments. We then examined co-occurrence between protists and prokaryotes, predicting putative symbiotic or predator-prey relationships, particularly among understudied protist groups with bacteria such as Verrucomicrobia and Rickettsiales. Our results substantially enhance the understanding of protistan diversity and distribution, revealing taxonomic blind spots and laying groundwork for future studies of these organisms ecological roles.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Here, we systematically profile the localization of protein isoforms generated by alternate start codon selection during translation. We identify hundreds of pairs of differentially-localized protein isoforms, many of which affect mitochondrial targeting and are essential for mitochondrial function. The emergence of dual-localized mitochondrial protein isoforms coincides with mitochondrial acquisition during early eukaryotic evolution. We further reveal that eukaryotes use diverse mechanisms--such as leaky ribosome scanning, alternative transcription, and paralog duplication--to maintain the production of dual-localized isoforms. Finally, we identify multiple isoforms that are specifically dysregulated by rare disease patient mutations and demonstrate how these mutations can help explain unique clinical presentations. Together, our findings illuminate the evolutionary and pathological relevance of alternative translation initiation, offering new insights into the molecular underpinnings of mitochondrial biology.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Objective To determine whether individuals hospitalized for severe COVID-19 exhibit a higher incidence of new onset cognitive impairment compared to those hospitalized for other conditions. Design A retrospective study emulating a target trial using Mass General Brigham electronic health records (March 2020-August 2024). The causal effect of COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated via cumulative incidence functions accounting for the competing risk of death. Setting Multicenter hospital-based study across the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. Participants A total of 221613 hospitalized patients met the eligibility criteria, including 6454 (2.0%) admitted due to COVID-19 and 215159 (98.0%) for all other conditions. Patients were excluded if they had less than three months of follow-up (due to censoring, cognitive impairment, or death), were younger than 55 years at baseline, or had no prior visit to Mass General Brigham in the year before baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was new-onset cognitive impairment, identified via ICD codes and dementia medication prescriptions. The primary analysis estimated the hazard ratio for cognitive impairment with COVID-19 hospitalization relative to other hospitalizations, along with the risk difference at 4.5 years estimated via cumulative incidence functions. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, hospitalization period). Results Among eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 69.55 [9.42] years, 55% female), those hospitalized for COVID-19 were significantly older and had more comorbidities (p < 0.05). COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (Hazard Ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.02-1.30], P = 0.018). At 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment was 12.5% [95% CI: 11.3-13.5] in the COVID-19 group, compared to 11.6% [95% CI: 11.1-12.1] in the non-COVID-19 group. Conclusions and Relevance Severe COVID-19 infection was associated with an elevated risk of developing clinically recognized cognitive impairment. Future studies are needed to validate findings in other health care settings. Early screening and intervention for cognitive decline may help optimize long-term outcomes for COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

Central to HIV infection and immune evasion is the envelope glycoprotein (Env), a heavily glycosylated class I fusion protein that mediates viral entry and is the sole immunogenic target. Despite the recent advancements provided by imaging techniques, the characterization of Envs structure and dynamics within its native membrane environment remains incomplete. Here, we present microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length Env glycoprotein embedded in a biologically relevant lipid bilayer with a complete glycosylation profile. Our simulations reveal a pronounced tilting motion of Env relative to the membrane, with supporting evidence from cryo-electron tomography, which also captures Env tilting within the native membrane. Importantly, we identify a critical role for N-linked glycans at N88 and N611 in modulating the tilting transition. These findings highlight the dual role of Envs glycan shield as both a protective barrier against neutralizing antibodies and a structural modulator of conformational plasticity. While providing an atomically detailed view of Env in a native membrane environment and advancing the general understanding of its glycan shield and its vulnerabilities, this work also suggests a possible strategy to modulate Envs conformational plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation5, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require IBs for viral transcription and replication. To uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish IBs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real-time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that IBs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. IB nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein-protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form  pre-replication centers (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their resistance to disassembly and efficient recruitment of newly-synthesized viral proteins. The high protein affinity of PRCs also results in increased polymerase complex association, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of IBs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid IB formation. Intriguingly, PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as the origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry, and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

This process, termed oogenesis, requires complex interactions amongst germline and somatic cell types in the ovary. How did these cell types and their signaling interactions evolve? Here we use the sea star Patiria miniata as a non-chordate deuterostome representative to define the ovarian cell type toolkit in echinoderms. Sea stars continuously produce millions of new oocytes throughout their lifespan, making them a practical system to understand the mechanisms that drive oogenesis from a biomedical and evolutionary perspective. We performed scRNA-seq combined with high-resolution 3D-imaging to reveal the ovarian cell types and their spatial organization. Our data support the presence of actively dividing oogonial stem cells and granulosa-like and theca-like cells, which display similarities and possible homology with their mammalian counterparts. Lastly, our data support the existence of an endocrine signaling system between oogonial stem cells and intrinsic ovarian neurons with striking similarities to the vertebrate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Overall, this study provides molecular evidence supporting the possible pre-chordate origins of conserved ovarian cell types, and the presence of an intrinsic neuroendocrine system which potentially controls oogenesis and predates the formation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Most of these cell types are established early in embryogenesis and persist into adulthood. However, in indirectly developing sea urchins, the continuity between embryonic and adult stages is thus interrupted by a planktonic larval stage that undergoes complete metamorphosis. In addition, while the gene regulatory networks governing distinct embryonic and larval cell lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of post-metamorphic sea urchin cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell type atlas of post-metamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, shedding light on the conservation of genetic regulatory mechanisms in post-metamorphic cell types. We identified cell signatures corresponding to eight distinct cell type groups and analyzed at least twenty-nine neuronal cell families, including fifteen unique photoreceptor cell signatures. By combining single cell transcriptomics with spatial gene expression analysis and high-resolution electron microscopy, we identified homologues of vertebrate neuronal genes and photoreceptive opsins expressed throughout the sea urchin body.

TEI can be initiated and maintained by small RNAs and histone modifications. The latter includes histone methylation, deposited by proteins with methyltransferase activity, including SET domain-containing proteins. Other SET domain-containing proteins with no catalytic methyltransferase activity also adopt roles in chromatin and gene expression regulation. Here, we describe SET-24, a SET domain-containing protein in Caenorhabditis elegans that belongs to a family of catalytically inactive SET proteins. SET-24 localises to germline nuclei and is required for germline immortality. Additionally, the inheritance of small RNA-driven epigenetic silencing is compromised in set-24 mutants. Using quantitative proteomics and yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that SET-24 interacts with Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1), a protein involved in epigenetic regulation and associated with known chromatin remodelling complexes, like COMPASS, which deposits H3K4me3. In set-24 mutants, hundreds of genes display increased H3K4me3 levels at their transcription start sites. While these changes are not matched at the transcriptional level, small RNA production is disrupted in approximately one fifth of those genes, which are normally targeted by small RNA pathways. We propose that SET-24 is a factor required to maintain epigenetic memory in the germline by maintaining a chromatin environment permissible to small RNA biogenesis over generations.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

However, DR is implemented using different diets and methods across species, and evidence for conservation at the mechanistic level remains limited. Here we tested the longevity and fecundity response to DR across eight different species of Drosophila using the same diets in a reaction norm framework. We confirm that DR is phenotypically conserved across Drosophila. Next, we used comparative transcriptomics across six species and found strongly concordant differential expression in response to DR (rs > 0.28, < 0.72, P < 0.0001). We studied the evolutionary history of the top concordantly differentially expressed orthologous genes and identified that the large majority of these genes are young genes and are Diptera specific. Our results indicate that large parts of the DR response are likely to be taxonomic specific, suggesting that the genetic basis of DR is not widely conserved. To validate this hypothesis we tested whether the 15 most conserved genes that change in transcription in response to DR using conditional in vivo RNAi. Surprisingly, we found that 12 out of 15 genes tested had a lifespan phenotype, with 9 extending lifespan. Five of these genes are related to cysteine metabolism implicating it in the mechanisms of DR, further suggesting physiological compensation to DR is ubiquitous and providing a possible biomedical target. Our findings suggest that while large parts of the DR response are taxonomically specific, some core mechanisms are conserved across divergent species. The comparative approaches we used here hold promise to identify shared mechanisms relevant to our own species and therefore ultimately anti-ageing interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Some recent works have reported conformational state populations by counting particle-images from cryo-EM. We wish to caution the community that these measurements are highly susceptible to noise and should not be relied upon as a precise estimate of the thermodynamic landscape of a biomolecule for understanding its biological function. Here, we demonstrate that the extremely noisy nature of cryo-EM images and uncertainty in the viewing orientations of biomolecules lead to ambiguities when assigning images to structures. If ignored, this ambiguity can introduce inherent bias when determining the populations of conformational states through individual particle assignment. We further show that modeling the conformational probability distribution using the entire image dataset mitigates these biases.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Using next-generation gene mapping approaches, we identified a genomic interval in chromosome 6 to be linked to BB resistance. Analysis of the SNPs in the locus and subsequent linkage analysis indicated that a missense SNP located in the second exon of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 6 (OsMAPK6) could be the causal mutation.

The candidate SNP causes the substitution of an invariant Serine residue with a Proline residue (S84P), thus likely affecting the protein function. Global transcriptome, metabolome, biochemical, and molecular analyses suggested that BB42 exhibit constitutive immunity. On the mechanistic front, the mutation seems to result in diminished brassinosteroid signaling in BB42. Taken together, we report a novel allele of a highly conserved MAPK gene and provide evidence for its possible association with constitutive immunity and disease resistance in rice.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Toxicity models are among the most commonly used mouse models to induce demyelination; however, it remains unclear whether different demyelination models elicit distinct glial responses, and how comparable these changes are to MS. To address this gap, we integrated new and published single cell transcriptomic data of the subcortical white matter from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and cuprizone toxicity models, and compared them to an existing human MS dataset. We find that LPC and cuprizone treatments induce distinct oligodendrocyte (OL) states, but a highly conserved microglial response upon demyelination. Interestingly, remyelinating OLs converge on an altered maturation state in both LPC and cuprizone models, potentially due to persistent activation of microglia at remyelination stages. Comparison of the mouse models with MS tissue reveals that key OL gene signatures specific to LPC and cuprizone demyelination are observed in MS patients, while microglia appear more heterogeneous across the different types of MS lesions. Finally, cross-species analysis highlights a conserved phenotype shared between cuprizone and actively demyelinating MS lesions, with downregulation of genes required for stable myelin production and increased cellular stress pathways. Overall, this comparative analysis uncovers specific gene expression differences between mouse demyelination models and human MS lesions, providing a foundation for using the animal models effectively to advance remyelination therapies.

Highlights- LPC and cuprizone demyelination induce distinct disease-associated oligodendrocyte states with shared pathological changes to MS lesions.
- Remyelinating oligodendrocytes converge on an altered maturation state.
- Microglia response to demyelination is highly conserved in mice but comparatively more heterogeneous in humans.
- Cuprizone treatment induces a disease-associated oligodendrocyte state resembling MS lesion pathology, with downregulation of genes required to produce stable myelin.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has achieved mesoscopic (< 0.5 mm) imaging of angioarchitecture, revealing fine vascular details that were previously inaccessible in vivo. However, current mesoscopic MRI methods for imaging angioarchitecture face two major limitations. First, acquisition times are prohibitively long--often exceeding 40 minutes--making integration into everyday clinical practice and research projects impractical. Second, even with data successfully acquired, conventional data visualization methods--such as 2D slice browsing and 3D vessel segmentation renders--are rudimentary and have limited effectiveness for navigating and interpreting the complex vascular network. In this paper, we present a fast whole-brain MRI protocol that provides robust images of the brains venous network at 0.35 mm resolution in under seven minutes. Additionally, we introduce novel data processing and visualization techniques that enable identification of specific vessel types and more informative navigation of the complex vascular network. We demonstrate that, with these advancements, we can reproduce, in vivo and without intravenous contrast application, the seminal postmortem vasculature images of Duvernoy and Vannson (1999). Furthermore, leveraging the ability for MRI to cover the entire brain, we achieve, for the first time, whole-brain intracortical mesoscopic vein maps in humans. Our acquisition and post-processing methods lay the groundwork for detailed examination of vascular organization across individuals, brain regions, and cortical layers. More generally, these methods make mesoscopic imaging of angioarchitecture viable for broad neuroscientific and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Individual plants mature at different rates due to genetics, environmental factors, and random chance. All of this contributes to trait heterogeneity. EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3), a core circadian clock component, determines developmental timing, and here we tested the hypothesis that it would shape trait heterogeneity. We developed a model predicting that faster-growing populations exhibit greater heterogeneity during development but reduced heterogeneity at maturity, while slower-growing populations show the opposite pattern. Experiments in Arabidopsis elf3 and barley Hvelf3 mutants supported this prediction. In Arabidopsis, ELF3 controlled hypocotyl elongation variability via maturation rate rather than direct regulation. Bolting time heterogeneity also decreased in faster-growing plants. In barley, Hvelf3 altered growth heterogeneity, but this was initially masked by germination timing differences. Finally, smaller barley plants were found to be more resilient to osmotic stress, suggesting that ELF3-driven trait heterogeneity may contribute to bet hedging. These findings highlight how modifying developmental rates influences population-level trait distributions and stress resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Here, we analyzed over 14,000 publicly available N. gonorrhoeae genome sequences from 2018-2024 generated through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention N. gonorrhoeae surveillance system, assessed the distribution of tetM, a plasmid-borne gene that confers high-level (MIC [&ge;] 16{micro}g/mL) tetracycline resistance, and evaluated the spatial, temporal, and evolutionary dynamics of its spread.

First the conservation of the GABA site explains the absence of insect-selective orthosteric compounds. Second, the classical modulation site, occupied here by abamectin, exists in a closed-pore conformation contrasting with ivermectin-bound states in other receptors. Third, using the fungal-derived Chrodrimamin B, we resolve an unanticipated membrane modulation pocket structurally analogous yet pharmacologically opposite to a neurosteroid site in mammalian receptors. Structures also reveal the existence of an intersubunit, conformation-dependent, PIP2 lipid site.

Skeletal muscle derangements contribute to depressed exercise capacity in PAH, but the mechanisms underlying muscle dysfunction including the changes in muscle biology based on fiber type are understudied. Methods: We evaluated exercise capacity, muscle histopathology, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics in the quadriceps (predominately fast fibers) and soleus (predominately slow fibers) muscles in the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of PAH. Results: MCT rats exhibited impaired exercise capacity. Surprisngly, there were divergent atrophic and metabolic remodeling in the quadriceps and soleus muscle of MCT rats. In the quadriceps, there was a mild atrophic response only in type II fibers. In contrast, both type I and II fibers atrophied in the soleus. Both muscles exhibited fibrotic infiltration, but mitochondrial density was reduced in the quadriceps only. Mitochondrial proteomics and tissue metabolomics/lipidomics profiling demonstrated the two muscles exhibited distinct responses as the quadriceps had impairments in oxidative phosphorylation/fat metabolism and storage of triacylglycerides. However, the soleus showed signs of proteasome deficiencies and alterations in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine homeostasis. Finally, profiling of metabolites/lipids in the serum identified novel potential biomarkers of exercise intolerance in PAH including the dimethylarginine pathway, cysteine, and triacylglycerides.

As ZIKV spread into new geographic regions, it now has the potential to interact with many novel potential host species whose susceptibility to the virus has yet to be determined. Mathematical models predict a sylvatic reservoir host of ZIKV, with non-human primates (NHPs) as the likely candidates, though outbreaks in areas without NHPs suggest the presence of other unidentified sylvatic reservoir hosts. Bats, with their ability to fly and live in or near human structures, are plausible ZIKV reservoirs. However, their competence as hosts for ZIKV remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the immune response of Old World and New World bats to ZIKV infection in vitro. Through comparative growth curves and transcriptomic analyses, we assess ZIKV susceptibility of cells derived from the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). R. aegyptiacus cells were susceptible to both African and Asian ZIKV isolates, while we observed little to no ZIKV replication in A. jamaicensis cells. Notably, ZIKV elicited a strong anti-inflammatory response in the R. aegyptiacus cell line, in contrast to the dampened inflammatory response in these bats to other viruses including Marburg virus.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThis study investigates how different lineages of Zika virus (ZIKV) interact with bat cells, specifically examining the cellular inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that cells from Old World bats (R06E cells derived from an Egyptian rousette bat) are permissive to infection by both lineages, supporting viral replication. This permissiveness suggests these cells can support the virus lifecycle, potentially facilitating broader transmission. In contrast, cells from New World bats (Aji cells from Jamaican fruit bats) exhibit low susceptibility to ZIKV, with negligible viral replication observed, suggesting an inherent resistance or lack of necessary factors for ZIKV to effectively initiate its lifecycle in this cell culture model. Our findings highlight the critical role of specific host cell characteristics in ZIKV transmission and underscore the importance of cellular context in understanding the viruss capability to induce an inflammatory immune response. By exploring the interactions of ZIKV with different bat cells, our research provides insights into the ecological and epidemiological complexities of ZIKV and provides insights into the evolutionary history of this virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Previous research suggests that both membrane trafficking and signaling activity are influenced by mechanical tension in the plasma membrane. Despite its importance, the mechanisms by which cells regulate membrane tension remain poorly understood. Using the optical tension sensor FliptR and AFM-assisted tether force measurements, we investigate plasma membrane tension regulation in mitotic cells by measuring tension changes following cytoskeletal and cell shape perturbations. Our findings show that in both assays, reported tensions are critically influenced by the cytoskeleton, however, with partially deviating trends highlighting the conceptual differences between bare and apparent membrane tension. By integrating experimental data with theoretical modeling, we demonstrate that the actin cytoskeleton regulates bare membrane tension through two distinct mechanisms: (i) modulation of intracellular hydrostatic pressure and (ii) adjustment of polymerization forces in actin-rich finger-like protrusions.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe plasma membrane is a vital cell interface, facilitating communication with the environment. Mechanical tension in the membrane plays a crucial role in tuning this communication, yet its regulation remains poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of precise measurement tools and the misleading use of membrane tether forces as proxies. In this study, we use advanced techniques -- FliptR tension sensors, AFM-based tether force measurements, and theoretical modeling -- to explore membrane tension in mitotically arrested cells. We find that the actin cytoskeleton regulates membrane tension via intracellular pressure control and polymerization forces in protrusions. Moreover, we show that tether forces do not reliably reflect in-plane membrane tension, making them unsuitable as direct reporters of membrane mechanics.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Most research focusses on Dictyostelium discoideum, which - due to its ease of culturing and genetic tractability - has been adopted as a model species in the fields of developmental biology, cell biology and microbiology. Over decades, genome editing methods in D. discoideum have steadily improved but remain relatively time-consuming and limited in scope, effective in a few species only. Here, we introduce a CRISPR-Cas9 editing protocol that is cloning-free, selection-free, highly-efficient, and effective across Dictyostelid species. After optimizing our protocol in D. discoideum, we obtained knock-out efficiencies of [~]80% and knock-in efficiencies of [~]30% without antibiotic selection. Efficiencies depend on template concentrations, insertion sizes, homology arms and target sites. Since our protocol is selection-free, we can isolate mutants as soon as one day post-transfection, vastly expediting the generation of knock-outs, fusion proteins and expression reporters. Our protocol also makes it possible to generate several knock-in mutations simultaneously in the same cells.

A genome-wide analysis showed significantly higher amylase copy numbers in Peruvian Andean genomes compared to closely related populations. Further, we identified positive selection at the nucleotide level on a haplotype harboring at least five haploid AMY1 copies, with a Peruvian Andean-specific expansion dated to/shortly after potato domestication (~6-10 kya). Using ultra-long-read sequencing, we demonstrated that recombination-based mutational mechanisms drive the formation of high-copy AMY1 haplotypes.

The FDA-approved mKIs to date ablate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling but do not target the paradoxical WNT signaling which is a key survival driver for the self-renewing cancer stem cells. The WNT pathway enhances cancer plasticity and triggers relapse of highly heterogenous tumours. Using de novo synthesis and structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies with blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetrant mKI scaffolds, we designed a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of PI3K, PDGFR/KIT, and the WNT pathway denoted Dyr726. Dyr726 is superior to clinical mKIs and inhibits PI3K-AKT-mTOR and WNT-pathway signaling at multiple nodes thereby impeding proliferation, invasion, and tumour growth. Phospho-proteomic, structural, and target engagement analyses, combined with in vitro, in vivo efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies reveal that Dyr726 is a brain-penetrant small molecule which effectively reduces tumour volume and extends survival of murine orthotopic models. Our current work establishes a first-in-class brain penetrant small molecule mKI which simultaneously antagonize the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and WNT pathways in preclinical cancer stem cell cultures, adult and pediatric primary organoids, and orthotopic murine models with positive efficacy in combination with clinical standard of care.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

The formation of large DynA clusters on membranes in response to pore-forming antibiotics and phages demonstrates its potential role in maintaining membrane integrity under various environmental stresses. In this study, we identified the membrane-binding site of B. subtilis DynA within the D1 domain of the protein that includes positively charged lysine residues K360 and K367, as well as hydrophobic phenylalanine residues F363, F364, and F365. For experimental validation, recombinant proteins with mutations in the lysine or phenylalanine residues were produced and used in liposome binding assays. Non-conservative mutations lead to a complete loss of DynAs membrane-binding capability. In vivo data showed that the membrane-binding mutants exhibit significantly increased susceptibility to phage infection compared to wild-type strains, further emphasizing the importance of DynAs membrane interaction in conferring phage resistance.

When inserted into the 5' UTR of an mRNA, these devices can regulate translation initiation upon specific binding of one or both ligands. The goal of this study is to design hybrid riboswitches that emulate Boolean NAND logic in yeast. We propose a novel machine learning-based design framework combining high-throughput in vivo screening and deep Bayesian optimization.

Heterozygous dominant mutations in the nucleoporin RANBP2/Nup358 predispose to influenza-triggered ANE1. The aim of our study was to determine whether RANBP2 plays a role in IAV-triggered inflammatory responses. We found that the depletion of RANBP2 in a human airway epithelial cell line increased IAV genomic replication by favouring the import of the viral polymerase subunits, PB1, PB2 and PA, and promoted an abnormal accumulation of some viral segments in the cytoplasm. In human primary macrophages, this corroborated with an enhanced production of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4. Then, using CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in for the ANE1 disease variant RANBP2-T585M, we demonstrated that the point mutation is sufficient to drive CXCL10 expression following activation downstream of RIG-I and leads to a redistribution of RANBP2 away from the nuclear pore. Together, our results reveal that RANBP2 regulates influenza RNA replication and nuclear export, triggering hyper-inflammation, offering insight into ANE pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Other eusocial species, such as bees, ants, and termites, also have long lifespans relative to their solitary kin. We propose that eusociality drives the evolution of longevity through three mechanisms: first, individuals in eusocial populations tend to be older than in non-eusocial populations, and thus genes favoring survival at later ages are more strongly selected; second, slower growth in eusocial populations reduces early mortality from resource scarcity, making longevity more important. Finally, the fitness benefits of long lifespan are stronger when the population's reproductive success rests on the survival of a single individual. Non-eusocial species reproducing in ways that partly access these benefits also have relatively long lifespans. We demonstrate these three mechanisms using mathematical models and computer simulations, highlighting longevity as an evolvable, selectable trait.

While microbial dynamics in the western Antarctic Peninsula are relatively well- studied, the northwestern region remains underexplored, particularly in long-term, multidomain analyses. To fill this gap, we investigated microbial communities encompassing all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) in the Northwestern Antarctic Peninsula. Using the universal primer set 515Y/926R, we sequenced unfractionated seawater from ten sites over a six-year period (2013-2019). Environmental parameters, temperature and salinity, showed minimal variation across the study. However, microbial diversity and composition, especially among eukaryotic phytoplankton, displayed significant temporal changes among seasons and years. The prokaryotic community, by contrast, was relatively stable, with Gammaproteobacteria-- particularly the Nitrincolaceae family--maintaining high relative abundance throughout all sampling periods, but a few distinct ASVs. In contrast, no eukaryotic group exhibited consistently high relative abundance across sampling periods. The summer of 2016, marked by a strong El Nino event, presented the most distinct microbial community structure, underscoring the sensitivity of these communities to extreme climatic conditions. These results highlight the importance of integrated, long-term studies to better understand the dynamics, interactions, and resilience of microbial ecosystems in the rapidly changing Antarctic environment.

IMPORTANCEThis study provides a unique long-term perspective on microbial community dynamics in the Northwestern Antarctic Peninsula, a region still poorly explored through a multidomain lens. By investigating the temporal variability of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes over six years, we reveal distinct stability patterns between these groups, with phytoplankton showing the highest variability and prokaryotes remaining relatively stable. The strong response of the microbial community to the 2016 El Nino event highlights its sensitivity to extreme climate conditions, reinforcing the importance of understanding how Antarctic ecosystems will respond to future climate shifts. The consistent presence of Nitrincolaceae, a key bacterial taxon, suggests its ecological relevance in the region, while fluctuations in phytoplankton composition may impact food web dynamics. These findings emphasize the need for continued long-term monitoring to predict how microbial communities will adapt to environmental changes, which is crucial for assessing the future functioning of polar marine ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Domestication of its wild progenitor, the African wildcat (F. lybica), is widely attributed to the emergence of farming. Wildcats are said to have been attracted to settled communities by the rodent populations that were thriving within this new agricultural niche. Some claim the African wildcat even reached Europe during the Neolithic, though many credit the Romans with their dispersal. Through a program of zooarchaeological analysis, genetic identification and radiocarbon dating, we redefine the established chronology for the cat's domestication and dispersal across Europe. We argue that early human-cat relationships were more complex than the commensal and mutualistic pathways that have been proposed, and that both the domestication and translocation of cats were linked to its association with deities. Our results suggest domestic cats first arrived in Europe prior to Roman expansion during the early first millennium BCE, and that successive populations of domestic cats with unique mitochondrial signatures were introduced during the Roman, Late Antique and Viking periods. Lastly, by characterising the spatiotemporal representation of both domestic cats and the native European wildcat (F. silvestris), we argue that the introduction of domestic cats precipitated a decline in native European wildcat populations.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Phenotypic, biochemical, and molecular analyses performed on single snrk2.4 or snrk2.10, and double snrk2.4/2.10 kinase mutants showed that SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10, acting redundantly, promote developmental leaf senescence. Further, SnRK2.4 and SnRK2.10 enhance ABA accumulation in senescing leaves by inducing NCED2, one of key ABA biosynthesis-related genes. The two kinases induce developmental leaf senescence by modulating the expression of multiple ABA-responsive, osmotic stress, and senescence-related genes, such as the senescence master regulators ORE1, ORS1, WRKY33, WRKY75, and ANAC087.

Bi-directional effects in cortex and hippocampus mediated by glucocorticoid signalling are causal to behavioural changes (n=91, p=0.0008), and scaling hippocampal with cortical activities restored memory in mice fed obesogenic food (n=44, p=0.02).

ConclusionThese results indicate that meal scheduling is a promising approach to confront glucocorticoid signalling bias and memory deficits caused by obesogenic food.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWhat and when we eat contributes to our health. This is particularly worrisome for kids and adolescents because of the lifelong effects that unrestricted snacking on highly caloric food could cause on brain maturation. A variety of school policies and nutritional programs have emerged to prevent poor nutritional habits. But obesity is on the rise and a major cause of neurological disabilities difficult to detect and treat. Human studies are limited by the size and duration of sampling with low resolution metrics to prove causality between nutritional habits and cognitive health trajectory. Animal studies showed that all-day snacking on highly caloric food disrupts innate biological rhythms that influence hormonal secretions, neuronal structure and function in brain regions that encode, store and retrieve memories. It isnt known if, like adipocytes and hepatocytes, the brain in obesity can develop glucocorticoid resistance -a state that would prevent the robust but complex effects of this hormone on memory- to the point that researchers still question whether glucocorticoids are a cause or solution to obesity related-brain comorbidities.

Added value of this studyLongitudinal sampling of several metrics at multiple timepoints in mice fed highly caloric food since peri-adolescence up to adulthood showed that the trajectory of obesity-related brain comorbidities is corrected when reinstating the feeding/fasting cycle, albeit consuming highly caloric food. Glucocorticoid resistance -manifesting as receptor phosphorylation deficits impeding coincidence detection between glucocorticoid and neuronal activities -was reversible when reinstating the feeding/fasting cycle, albeit consuming highly caloric food. Studies in receptor mutant mice lacking a phosphorylation site-independent of glucocorticoids showed it is required to reinstate neuroplasticity to changes of feeding/fasting cycle, albeit consuming highly caloric food. Fos-trapping experiments showed less engagement of pyramidal neurons in the cortex when activity-dependent phosphorylation of glucocorticoid receptor was low, and more in the hippocampus of mice fed obesogenic diet, which reinstating the feeding/fasting cycle reverted, albeit consuming highly caloric food. Finally, chemogenetic experiments confirmed the requirement for the co-engagement of cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons to fully remember, despite poor nutritional habits.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe cortico-hippocampal activities necessary for remembering are uncoupled by obesogenic food consumed ad libitum but not on meal scheduling, extending neuroimaging correlation studies in obese adolescents. Poor nutritional habits cause glucocorticoid resistance in the brain as previously suggested, with altered neuronal representation of memory that meal scheduling corrected. This result should transform school policies and familial nutritional habits to promote cognitive health. Future research will develop allosteric ligands targeting phosphorylation motifs in the glucocorticoid receptor as more specific alternative to orthosteric ligands for the treatment of obesity-related brain comorbidities.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Caloric restriction improves healthspan across eukaryotes but is unrealistic as a societal intervention. Here, we describe the rewiring of a highly conserved nutrient sensing system to prevent senescence onset and declining fitness in budding yeast even when aged on an unrestricted high glucose diet. We show that AMPK activation can prevent the onset of senescence by activating two pathways that remove excess acetyl coenzyme A from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria - the glyoxylate cycle and the carnitine shuttle. However, AMPK represses fatty acid synthesis from acetyl coenzyme A, which is critical for normal cellular function and growth. AMPK activation therefore has positive and negative effects during ageing. Combining AMPK activation with a point mutation in fatty acid synthesis enzyme Acc1 that prevents inhibition by AMPK (the A2A mutant) allows cells to maintain fitness late in life without reducing the mortality associated with advanced age. Our research shows that ageing in yeast is not intrinsically associated with loss of fitness, and that metabolic re-engineering allows high fitness to be preserved to the end of life.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Here, we explored the molecular modifications influencing sensory perception across the nematode phyla. Pristionchus pacificus is a predatory species and has evolved contact-dependent sensing and teeth-like structures to attack prey. Using mutants defective for mechanosensory neuron function, we found an expanded role for this sensory modality in efficient predation alongside its canonical function in sensing aversive touch. To identify the precise mechanism involved in this tactile divergence we generated mutations in 26 canonical mechanosensory genes and tested their function using a combination of behavioural assays, automated behavioural tracking and machine learning. While mechanosensory defects were observed in several mutants, Ppa-mec-6 mutants specifically also induced predation deficiencies. Previously, a similar phenotype was observed in a chemosensory defective mutant and we found a synergistic influence on predation in mutants lacking both sensory inputs. Importantly, both chemosensory and mechanosensory receptor expression converge on the same environmentally exposed IL2 neurons revealing these as the primary mechanism for sensing prey. Thus, predation evolved through the co-option of both mechanosensory and chemosensory systems which act synergistically to shape the evolution of complex behavioural traits.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Here, we extend and improve existing approaches and develop three novel landscape phylogeographic methods that can test the impact of continuous environmental factors on the diffusion velocity of viral lineages. In order to evaluate the different methods, we also implemented two simulation frameworks to test and compare their statistical performance. The results enable us to formulate clear guidelines for the use of three complementary landscape phylogeographic approaches that have sufficient statistical power and low rates of false positives.

Physical activity is inversely associated with each of these diseases; however, the biologic pathways underlying these relationships remain incompletely understood.

MethodsIn 33,806 UK Biobank participants, we derived a proteomic signature (high-throughput panel of 2,911 proteins assessed by Olink array) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity using linear and LASSO regressions in a two-step procedure to prospectively assess associations with physical activity-related cancers (1,108 cases), CVD (3,445 cases), T2D (1,363 cases), as well as progression to multimorbidity (420 cases). Multivariable Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each identified protein, as well as their linear combination (proteomics signature score), separately for each outcome and with adjustment for physical activity. Pathway enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks were used to gain insights into the systemic interplay of the identified proteins.

ResultsAfter correction for multiple testing, 223 proteins were selected in the physical activity signature. Proteins involved in food intake, metabolism, and cell growth regulation (e.g., LEP, MSTN, TGFBR2) were inversely associated with physical activity. Proteins involved in immune cell adhesion and migration, as well as cartilage and muscle integrity (e.g., integrins, COMP, MYOM3) were positively associated with physical activity. Several proteins upregulated by physical activity were inversely associated with disease risk (e.g., integrins, PI3, CLEC4A for cancer risk, or LPL, IGFBP1, LEP for T2D risk). Similarly, various proteins were downregulated by physical activity and positively associated with disease risk (e.g., CD38, TGFA for CVD risk). For multimorbidity, proteins inversely related to physical activity generally aligned with expected risk patterns, while positively associated proteins exhibited mixed effects, with inverse and positive associations. The proteomics signature score was inversely associated with the risk of cancer (HR per interquartile range: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.96) and T2D (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.72), after adjustment for physical activity, but not with CVD (HR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.03) and progression towards multimorbidity.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the inverse relationships between physical activity and risk of major chronic diseases may be explained by the maintenance of tissue integrity and the proper regulation of immune and metabolic processes. Further studies are needed to determine the causal nature of these associations.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

Current understanding of the Fo pathogenicity mechanisms is primarily centered on vascular plants, where individual isolates of Fo exhibit contrasting lifestyles across the endophyte-pathogen continuum on different host species. Although, Fo isolates were recently shown to cause disease on the non-vascular liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (Mp), the transcriptional control of Fo effectors during infection of this bryophytic host is largely unknown. Here, we took a comparative transcriptomic approach to ask how different Fo isolates with contrasting interaction outcomes on angiosperms (pathogenic versus endophytic) adapt to a distantly related plant lineage lacking xylem. We found that the core effector complement encoded on genomic regions shared across all Fo isolates are actively transcribed in Mp, whereas effectors encoded on lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions that contribute towards host-specific pathogenicity in angiosperms are not. Moreover, we observed enhanced transcriptional activation of effector clusters located on the three highly syntenic fast core chromosomes during growth on Mp, as well as divergent lineages and lifestyles, suggesting a conserved role in plant associations. Loss of a compatibility-associated effector encoded in a core effector cluster led to misregulation of other effectors in core clusters. Our findings reveal an unexpected role of fast core chromosomes in determining compatibility of Fo across a broad spectrum of plant lineages and establishes evolutionarily conserved gene networks essential for fungus-plant associations.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Here, we report that the phase of theta oscillations (3 to 6 Hz) in the frontal eye field (FEF) is associated with temporal and spatial variation of the read-out of information from working memory (WM). Non-human primates were briefly shown a sample array of colored squares. A short time later, they viewed a test array and were rewarded for identifying which square changed color (the target). Better performance (accuracy and reaction time) varied systematically with the phase of local field potential (LFP) theta at the time of test array onset as well as the target location. This is consistent with theta scanning across the FEF and thus visual space from top to bottom. Theta was coupled, on opposing phases, to both spiking and beta (12 to 20 Hz). These results could be explained by a wave of activity that moves across the FEF, modulating the readout of information from WM.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems provide an intriguing counterpoint to this strategy by leveraging DNA synthesis instead2,3. We and others recently showed that DRT2 systems use an RNA template to assemble a de novo gene, leading to expression of an antiviral effector protein, Neo4,5. It remains unknown whether similar mechanisms of defense are employed by other DRT families. Focusing on DRT9, here we uncover an unprecedented mechanism of DNA homopolymer synthesis, in which viral infection triggers polydeoxyadenylate (poly-dA) accumulation in the cell to drive abortive infection and population-level immunity. Cryo-EM structures reveal how a conserved noncoding RNA serves as both a structural scaffold and reverse transcription template to direct hexameric complex assembly and RNA-templated poly-dA synthesis. Remarkably, biochemical and functional experiments identify conserved tyrosine residues within the reverse transcriptase itself that prime DNA synthesis, leading to the formation of high-molecular weight protein-DNA covalent adducts. Synthesis of poly-dA in vivo is regulated by the competing activities of phage-encoded triggers and host-encoded silencers of DRT9. Collectively, our work unveils a novel nucleic acid-driven defense system that expands the paradigm of bacterial immunity and broadens the known functions of reverse transcriptases.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Because dopamine influences blood vessel dilation, we hypothesized that hemodynamic latency, which reflects BOLD signal timing, could serve as an indirect marker of dopamine physiology. Across four datasets, we found a topography of hemodynamic latencies that precisely distinguished the nucleus accumbens, a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and substance abuse, from other striatal regions. Using PET, genetics, and pharmacology, we found that hemodynamic latencies are robustly related to dopamine function and dopamine-linked behavior. In individuals with cocaine use disorder, we observed a spatial gradient of altered hemodynamic latencies in the striatum. This pattern independently predicted nicotine use, revealing a conserved physiological profile associated with addictive substance use.

We present an optimized perchloric acid-based workflow with neutralization - PCA-N - that addresses these limitations. By introducing a neutralization step following protein precipitation, PCA-N enables direct enzymatic digestion without additional purification steps, reducing sample volume requirements to only 5 {micro}L of plasma while maintaining deep plasma proteome coverage. The streamlined protocol allows preparation of over 10,000 samples per day using 384-well formats at costs comparable to undepleted plasma analysis (NEAT). Rigorous validation according to the recently introduced CLSI C64 guideline demonstrated that despite somewhat higher technical variability compared to NEAT, PCA-N maintained excellent biological resolution and reproducibility. We confirmed the workflows exceptional stability through analysis of 1,500 quality control samples systematically interspersed among 36,000 plasma samples measured continuously over 311 days. Technical performance remained consistent across multiple instruments, sample preparation batches and nearly a year of measurements. Compared to NEAT plasma proteomics, PCA-N doubled the proteomic depth while maintaining comparable reagent costs and throughput. The minimal sample reequipments, operational simplicity while using only common laboratory chemical and exceptional scalability positions PCA-N as an attractive approach for population-level plasma proteomics, democratizing access to deep plasma proteome analysis.

Although CH frequently occurs with aging, it rarely progresses to overt malignancy. Population variation in the growth rate and potential of mutant clones suggests the presence of genetic factors protecting against CH, but these remain largely undefined. Here, we identify a non-coding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that significantly protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by downregulating HSC-selective expression and function of the RNA-binding protein MSI2. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncover an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk. Importantly, rs17834140-T is associated with slower CH expansion rates in humans, and stem cell MSI2 levels modify ASXL1-mutant HSC clonal dominance in experimental models. These findings leverage natural resilience to highlight a key role for post-transcriptional regulation in human HSCs, and offer genetic evidence supporting inhibition of MSI2 or its downstream targets as rational strategies for blood cancer prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Application of in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) made it possible to visualize the consequences of mitochondrial depolarization at higher resolution than heretofore attainable. Parkin-expressing U2OS cells were treated with the depolarizing agents oligomycin and antimycin A (OA), subjected to cryo-FIB milling, and mitochondrial structure was characterized by in situ cryo-ET. Phagophores were visualized in association with mitochondrial fragments. Bridge-like lipid transporter (BLTP) densities potentially corresponding to ATG2A were seen connected to mitophagic phagophores. Mitochondria in OA-treated cells were fragmented and devoid of matrix calcium phosphate crystals. The intermembrane gap of cristae was narrowed and the intermembrane volume reduced, and some fragments were devoid of cristae. A subpopulation of ATP synthases re-localized from cristae to the inner boundary membrane (IBM) apposed to the outer membrane (OMM). The structure of the dome-shaped prohibitin complex, a dodecamer of PHB1-PHB2 dimers, was determined in situ by sub-tomogram averaging in untreated and treated cells and found to exist in open and closed conformations, with the closed conformation is enriched by OA treatment. These findings provide a set of native snapshots of the manifold nano-structural consequences of mitochondrial depolarization and provide a baseline for future in situ dissection of Parkin-dependent mitophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

At anaphase onset, sister separation is triggered by cleavage of the cohesin subunit SCC1/RAD21 by the cysteine protease separase2-5. SCC1 contains two cleavage sites, where cleavage is stimulated by SCC1 phosphorylation5,6. The molecular mechanisms of substrate recognition and cleavage are only partly understood7. Here, we determined a series of cryoEM structures of human separase in apo-or substrate-bound forms that, together with biochemical analysis, provide novel insights into the regulation of separase cleavage activity. We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second site. We show that multiple substrates, including separase autocleavage sites8,9 and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with several docking sites in separase, including four phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the structural basis of the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/A2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second site in SCC1. Finally, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryoEM, we propose a model of how cohesin is targeted by human separase.

These rare states influence protein function, interactions, aggregation, and immunogenicity, yet they remain far less understood than protein native states. Although native protein structures are now often predictable with impressive accuracy, conformational fluctuations and their energies remain largely invisible and unpredictable, and experimental challenges have prevented large-scale measurements that could improve machine learning and physics-based modeling. Here, we introduce a multiplexed experimental approach to analyze the energies of conformational fluctuations for hundreds of protein domains in parallel using intact protein hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We analyzed 5,778 domains 28-64 amino acids in length, revealing hidden variation in conformational fluctuations even between sequences sharing the same fold and global folding stability. Site-resolved hydrogen exchange NMR analysis of 13 domains showed that these fluctuations often involve entire secondary structural elements with lower stability than the overall fold. Computational modeling of our domains identified structural features that correlated with the experimentally observed fluctuations, enabling us to design mutations that stabilized low-stability structural segments. Our dataset enables new machine learning-based analysis of protein energy landscapes, and our experimental approach promises to reveal these landscapes at unprecedented scale.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

Although various nuclei isolation methods have been developed, systematic evaluations of their effects on nuclear integrity and subsequent data quality remain lacking, a critical gap with profound implications for the rigor and reproducibility. To address this, we compared three mechanistically distinct nuclei isolation strategies with brain tissues: a sucrose gradient centrifugation-based method, a spin column-based method, and a machine-assisted platform. All methods successfully captured diverse cell types but revealed considerable protocol-dependent differences in cell type proportions, transcriptional homogeneity, and the preservation of cell-type-specific and cell-state-specific markers. Moreover, isolation workflows differentially influenced contamination levels from ambient, mitochondrial, and ribosomal RNAs. Our findings establish nuclei isolation methodology as a critical experimental variable shaping snRNA-seq data quality and biological interpretation.

MOTIVATIONSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has become an essential tool for transcriptomic analysis of complex tissues. However, the quality and efficiency of data generation depend heavily on the method used for nuclear isolation. The existing isolation techniques vary in their ability to preserve nuclear integrity, minimize ambient RNA contamination, and optimize recovery rates. Despite these differences in quality, a systematic comparison of these methods, specifically for brain tissue, is lacking. This gap poses a challenge for researchers in choosing the most suitable approach for their particular experimental requirements. To address this critical issue, our study directly compared three nuclei isolation methods and evaluated their performance in terms of yield, purity, and downstream sequencing quality. By providing a comprehensive assessment, we aim to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate isolation protocol for their snRNA-seq experiments, ensuring optimal results and advancing the study of complex brain tissues at the single-nucleus level.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

In this study we analyzed genomes derived from cultures and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes focusing on characters indicative of genome evolution. Our results show an enrichment of short length transposable elements (TEs) and pseudogenes in the periplasmic endosymbiont genomes, suggesting an active and transitionary period in genome evolution. In contrast, genomes of endobionts exhibited fewer TEs and pseudogenes, reflecting advanced stages of genome reduction and increased host dependency in the endobionts. Pangenome analyses identified that endobionts streamline their genomes and conserve a majority of their genes in the core, whereas periplasmic endobionts and epibionts maintain larger flexible genomes, suggesting increased genomic plasticity. Functional gene comparisons with other N2-fixing cyanobacteria revealed that Richelia endobionts have similar patterns of metabolic loss but are distinguished by absence of specific pathways (e.g. cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, lipid-A) that increase dependency and direct interaction with their respective hosts. In conclusion, our findings underscore the dynamic nature of genome reduction in N2-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts and demonstrate the diatom-Richelia symbioses as a valuable and rare model to study genome evolution in the transitional stages from a free-living facultative symbiont to a host-dependent endobiont.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

A major translational challenge in analgesic development is the difference in gene expression and functional properties between human and rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Extensive work in rodents suggests that sensitization of nociceptors in the DRG is essential for the pathogenesis and persistence of pain; however, direct evidence demonstrating similar physiological sensitization in humans is limited. Here, we examine whether pain history is associated with nociceptor hyperexcitability in human DRG (hDRG). We identified three electrophysiologically distinct clusters (E-types) of hDRG neurons based on firing properties and membrane excitability. Combining electrophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA-sequencing (""Patch-seq""), we linked these E-types to specific transcriptionally defined nociceptor subpopulations. Comparing hDRG neurons from donors with and without evident pain history revealed cluster-specific, pain history-associated differences in hDRG excitability. Finally, we found that hDRG from donors with pain history express higher levels of transcripts encoding voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) and 1.8 (NaV1.8) which specifically regulate nociceptor excitability. These findings suggest that donors with pain history exhibit distinct hDRG electrophysiological profiles compared to those without pain history and further validate NaV1.7 and 1.8 as targets for analgesic development.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

In this context, Python programming language is extensively used for manipulation and analysis of data stored in a tabular-form of rows and columns called dataframe. Pandas is the most-widely used Python dataframe package and is criticized for its inefficiencies and scalability problems that its novel alternative - Polars - tries to address with a vectorized backend written in Rust programming language.

Resultspolars-bio is a Python library that enables fast, parallel and out-of-core operations on large genomic intervals datasets. Its main components are implemented in Rust, using the Apache DataFusion query engine and Apache Arrow for efficient data representation. It is compatible with Polars and Pandas DataFrame formats. Single-thread benchmarking results confirm that for operations such as count overlaps is 38x and coverage is 15x faster than the state-of-the-art bioframe library. Our implementation of overlap operation consumes 90x less memory in streaming mode. Multi-thread benchmarks show good scalability and up to 282x speedup for count overlaps operation when executed with 8 CPU cores. To the best of our knowledge, polars-bio is the fastest single-node library for genomic interval dataframes in Python.

However, simulations incorporating realistic selection along heterogeneous genomes in complex demographic histories are challenging, limiting our ability to benchmark statistical methods aimed at detecting selection and to explore theoretical predictions. stdpopsim is a community-maintained simulation library that already provides an extensive catalog of species-specific population genetic models. Here we present a major extension to the stdpopsim framework that enables simulation of various modes of selection, including background selection, selective sweeps, and arbitrary distributions of fitness effects (DFE) acting on annotated subsets of the genome (for instance, exons). This extension maintains stdpopsims core principles of reproducibility and accessibility while adding support for species-specific genomic annotations and published DFE estimates. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by benchmarking methods for demographic inference, DFE estimation, and selective sweep detection across several species and scenarios. Our results demonstrate the robustness of demographic inference methods to selection on linked sites, reveal the sensitivity of DFE-inference methods to model assumptions, and show how genomic features, like recombination rate and functional sequence density, influence power to detect selective sweeps. This extension to stdpopsim provides a powerful new resource for the population genetics community to explore the interplay between selection and other evolutionary forces in a reproducible, low-barrier framework.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

As they mature and gain independence from caregivers, juveniles stop producing infant calls and begin producing adult-like vocalizations in a variety of species-typical contexts. Neonatal mice (Mus musculus) produce ""isolation"" ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when separated from the nest, and in contrast, adolescent and adult mice produce ""social"" USVs during interactions with conspecifics. Although this transition in vocal behavior is known to occur, its developmental timing remains poorly described. In the current study, we performed longitudinal measurements of mouse USVs to establish the age at which juvenile mice begin producing social USVs. Every 4 days (postnatal day (P)12-P28), USVs were first recorded from individual mice in solo sessions to establish rates of isolation/spontaneous USVs and then were recorded again during interactions between same-sex and opposite-sex pairs of age-matched, socially novel (non-littermate) C57BL/6J mice. We report that juvenile mice begin producing social USVs earlier than previously reported, at ages P20-P24. Moreover, although these early social USVs are produced at low rates compared to adult social USVs, they are nonetheless temporally coordinated with active social interaction. Our characterization of the timing of the transition from isolation USVs to social USVs forms a foundation to investigate brain mechanisms that enable the context-dependent regulation of vocal communication over development.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

We document an exception to this pattern in the wider Rhine-Meuse area in communities in the wetlands, riverine areas, and coastal areas of the western and central Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany, where we assembled genome-wide data for 109 people 8500-1700 BCE. Here, a distinctive population with high hunter-gatherer ancestry ([~]50%) persisted up to three thousand years later than in continental European regions, reflecting limited incorporation of females of Early European Farmer ancestry into local communities. In the western Netherlands, the arrival of the Corded Ware complex was also exceptional: lowland individuals from settlements adopting Corded Ware pottery had hardly any steppe ancestry, despite a characteristic early Corded Ware Y-chromosome. The limited influx may reflect the unique ecology of the regions river-dominated landscapes, which were not amenable to wholesale adoption of the early Neolithic type of farming introduced by Linearbandkeramik, making it possible for previously established groups to thrive, and creating a persistent but permeable boundary that allowed transfer of ideas and low-level gene flow. This changed with the formation-through-mixture of Bell Beaker using populations [~]2500 BCE by fusion of local Rhine-Meuse people (9-17%) and Corded Ware associated migrants of both sexes. Their expansion from the Rhine-Meuse region then had a disruptive impact across a much wider part of northwest Europe, including Britain where its arrival was the main source of a 90-100% replacement of local Neolithic peoples.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

ObjectivesMulti-omic analyses defined the cellular and molecular mediators associated with RA dysfunction in pulmonary artery banded (PAB) swine.

Methods4-week-old castrated male Yorkshire pigs were subjected to PAB and aged six weeks to induce right heart failure. Cardiac MRI evaluated RA size and function. snRNAseq defined the cell-specific alterations in RA tissue. Mitochondrial proteomics and metabolomics analyses examined the metabolic alterations in RA samples. Inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-ACM) were treated with tunicamycin to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial structure and function were probed.

ResultsPAB induced RA dilation/dysfunction and atrial cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. snRNAseq demonstrated PAB altered the cellular composition of the RA defined by increased inflammatory macrophages and an alteration of cardiomyocyte subpopulations. RA cardiomyocytes exhibited ER stress and mitochondrial metabolic enzyme dysregulation. PAB RAs, but not PAB right ventricles, had downregulation of branched chain amino acid degrading enzymes. Metabolomics profiling revealed BCAA and fatty acid metabolism were impaired in the dysfunctional RA. Tunicamycin-induced ER stress disrupted mitochondrial structure/function in iPSC-ACMs.

Connexin-32 (Cx32) GJCs mediate intercellular coupling in a variety of tissues, and specifically in the myelinating Schwann cells. Mutations in Cx32, such as W3S, are associated with peripheral neuropathy, X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1X) disease. Phospholipids and sterols have been shown to regulate permeation through Cx32 GJCs, although the mechanism of regulation of Cx32 and other GJCs by lipids remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of Cx32 GJCs reconstituted in nanodiscs, revealing that phospholipids block the pore of Cx32 GJC by binding to the site formed by N-terminal gating helices. The phospholipid-bound state is contingent on the presence of a sterol molecule bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminus: the N-terminal helix of Cx32 fails to sustain a phospholipid binding site in the absence of cholesterol hemisuccinate. Consistent with this, the CMT1X-linked W3S mutant which has an impaired sterol binding site adopts a conformation of the N-terminus incompatible with phospholipid binding. Our results indicate that different lipid species control connexin channel gating directly by influencing the conformation of the N-terminal gating helix.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

The origins of the seed membranes and their relationship to the lipid transport machinery are poorly understood. Using proximity labeling and a variety of fluorescence microscopy techniques, we show that ATG2A localizes to extra-Golgi ARFGAP1 puncta during autophagosome biogenesis. ARFGAP1 itself is dispensable during macroautophagy, but among other proteins associating to these membranes, we find that Rab1 is essential. ATG2A co-immunoprecipitates strongly with Rab1a, and siRNA-mediated depletion of Rab1 blocks autophagy downstream of LC3B lipidation, similar to ATG2A depletion. Further, when either autophagosome formation or the early secretory pathway is perturbed, ARFGAP1 and Rab1a accumulate at ectopic locations with autophagic machinery. Our results suggest that ATG2A engages a Rab1a complex on select early secretory membranes at an early stage in autophagosome biogenesis.

Significance StatementThis study elucidates the role of early secretory membranes in autophagosome biogenesis. The authors demonstrate that Rab1/ARFGAP1 positive membranes are essential to autophagy and are recruited to the phagophore assembly site at an early step of autophagosome biogenesis. These membranes interact with the bridge-like lipid transport protein ATG2A and are positive for LC3B and WIPI2, suggesting that Rab1 membranes are a direct source for autophagosome growth.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

However, variants at these loci are largely noncoding, making it difficult to assess their function and whether they are causal. Here, we present a single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility atlas of human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choroid to systematically analyze both coding and noncoding variants implicated in AMD. We employ HiChIP and Activity-by-Contact modeling to map enhancers in these tissues and predict cell and gene targets of risk variants. We further perform allele-specific self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) to functionally test variant activity in RPE cells, including in the context of complement activation. Our work nominates new pathogenic variants and mechanisms in AMD and offers a rich and accessible resource for studying diseases of the RPE and choroid.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743286101790

The diversification of the sarbecovirus spike gene and the mammalian ACE2 gene suggests that sarbecoviruses and their hosts have co-evolved, and the genetic diversity in these genes affects the host tropism of sarbecoviruses. Better comprehending the evolutionary potential of sarbecoviruses can lead to preparedness for the next pandemic. However, the host tropism of sarbecoviruses is not fully understood. Here, we performed round-robin pseudovirus infection assays using 53 sarbecoviruses and ACE2s from 17 mammals to elucidate the ACE2 tropism of sarbecoviruses in natural hosts, potential intermediate hosts and humans. We determined the factors responsible for the ACE2 tropism of sarbecoviruses through structural, phylogenetic analyses, and infection experiments, revealing which substitutions can expand the host range of sarbecoviruses. These results highlight the mechanisms modulating host tropism throughout sarbecovirus evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

In metagenomic studies, fragments can be mapped against multiple references or de novo assembled contigs to identify those likely to be ancient. Generating and comparing damage profiles to identify samples or contigs that are likely to stem from modern contaminants, however, can be both tedious and time-consuming. Although tools exist for estimating damage in single reference genomes and metagenomic datasets, none efficiently cluster damage patterns.

ResultsTo address this methodological gap, we developed AdDeam, a tool that combines rapid damage estimation with clustering for streamlined analyses and easy identification of potential contaminants or outliers. Our tool takes aligned aDNA fragments from various samples or contigs as input, computes damage patterns, clusters them and outputs representative damage profiles per cluster, a probability of each sample of pertaining to a cluster as well as a PCA of the damage patterns for each sample for fast visualisation. We evaluated AdDeam on both simulated and empirical datasets. AdDeam effectively distinguishes different damage levels, such as UDG-treated samples, sample-specific damages from specimens of different time periods, and can also distinguish between contigs containing modern or ancient fragments, providing a clear framework for aDNA authentication and facilitating large-scale analyses.

They influence each others behavior, but how important this is and how they process and represent social information in their brain is less well understood. This includes fruit flies and fly larvae, which are usually not known as ""social insects"". Using a Drosophila larva assay with reduced stimulation, we found that larval groups show enhanced dispersal and distance from each other in the absence of food. This social context-dependent modulation overrides responses to other external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available in Drosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for normal social context modulation. Our results show that even less social animals like fly larvae are affected by conspecifics and that they recognize each other through multimodal sensory cues. This study provides a tractable system for future dissection of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying social interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790

However, little is known about their biology, even in the model diplonemid Paradiplonema papillatum whose genome sequence is available. Examining the subcellular localization of proteins using fluorescence microscopy is a powerful approach to infer their putative function. Here we report a plasmid-based method that enables YFP-tagging of a gene at the endogenous locus. By examining the localization of proteins whose homologs are involved in chromosome segregation in other eukaryotes, we discovered several interesting features in mitotically dividing P. papillatum cells. Cohesin is enriched on condensed interphase chromatin. During mitosis, chromosomes organize into two rings (termed metaphase rings herein) that surround the elongating nucleolus. Homologs of chromosomal passenger complex components (INCENP, two Aurora kinases, and KIN-A), a CLK1 kinase, spindle checkpoint protein Mad1, and microtubule regulator XMAP215 localize in between the two metaphase rings, suggesting that kinetochores may assemble in between them. We also found that a homolog of the meiotic chromosome axis protein SYCP2L1 is enriched in between metaphase rings during mitosis. These features have some resemblance to the bivalent bridge (also known as the modified synaptonemal complex), which is thought to mediate the linkage between homologous chromosomes using axis components in Bombyx mori female meiotic metaphase I. By representing the first molecular characterization of mitotic mechanisms in P. papillatum and raising a number of questions, this study forms the foundation for dissecting mitotic mechanisms in diplonemids.","NA","biorxiv",1743286101790
