Accumulated research evidence suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating potential shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore shared metabolic disturbances in the muscle tissue of patients. Utilizing genome-wide metabolic modeling, we identified key metabolic irregularities in the muscle of patients with ME/CFS, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Further, in silico knockout analyses suggested that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. In addition, assessments of metabolomic levels in Long COVID patients also showed the significant downregulation of ASP during post-exertional malaise (PEM) in both muscle and blood. Consequently, we propose that a combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) is a potential candidate to alleviate metabolic symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID for future clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

A subset meets diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several studies have reported persistence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins or RNA in serum or tissues of both recovered individuals and PCS patients.

In this exploratory study, we investigated whether serum spike protein is associated with PCS and whether it correlates with symptom severity and laboratory biomarkers. We analyzed serum spike protein levels in 121 PCS patients following mild-to-moderate COVID-19, 72 of whom met diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (post-COVID ME/CFS, pcMECFS). Pre-pandemic seronegative healthy controls (ppHC, n = 32) and post-COVID recovered healthy controls (pcHC, n = 37) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also included in the study.

We found persistent serum SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a subset of pcHC (11 %), PCS non-ME/CFS patients (2 %), and pcMECFS patients (14 %). There was no significant association with disease severity, symptoms, or laboratory markers. The spike protein concentration was independent of the time since last spike exposure (infection or vaccination). In five spike-positive out of a total of 22 patients who underwent immunoglobulin depletion via immunoadsorption (IA), spike protein was reduced or completely removed after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins.

In summary, our study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection without evidence for a role in the pathogenesis of PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

With the increased use of exome sequencing in the clinical setting, there is opportunity to identify patients who have a high chance of having elevated Lp(a) and are therefore at risk of ASCVD. However, accurate genetic predictors of Lp(a) are challenging to design. In addition to single nucleotide variants (SNVs), which are often summarized as a combined genetic risk score, Lp(a) levels are significantly impacted by copy number variation in repeats of the kringle IV subtype 2 domain (KIV-2), which are challenging to quantify. KIV-2 copy numbers are highly variable across populations, and understanding their impact on Lp(a) levels is important to creating an equitable and reliable genetic predictor of Lp(a)-driven cardiovascular risk for all individuals.

MethodsWe develop a novel method to quantify individuals total number of KIV-2 repeats from exome data, validate this quantification against measured Lp(a) levels, and then use this method, combined with a SNV-based genetic risk score, to genotype an entire all-comers cohort of individuals from health systems across the United States (Helix Research Network; N = 76,147) for an estimated Lp(a) level.

ResultsOur combined genotyping strategy improved prediction of those with clinically-elevated Lp(a) measurements across the genetically diverse cohort, especially for individuals not genetically similar to European reference populations, where GRS-based estimates fall short (r2= 0.04 for GRS, r2 = 0.34 KIV2+GRS in non-European). Importantly, high combined genetic risk of high Lp(a) genotypes are significantly associated with earlier onset and increased incidence in ASCVD, compared to average and low combined genetic risk genotypes in a retrospective analysis of atherosclerotic diagnoses derived from electronic health records (EHRs). This holds in the cohort at large (CAD HRs=1.29, 1.58), in the European subcohort (HRs=1.30,1.61) as well as at trending levels of significance in individuals not genetically similar to Europeans (HRs=1.22,1.31). In addition, high combined genetic risk for high Lp(a) genotypes are at least 2-fold enriched amongst individuals with ASCVD diagnosis despite a lack of EHR-based evidence of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that genetically predicted Lp(a) levels, incorporating both SNV and our novel KIV-2 repeat estimate, may be a practical method to predict clinically elevated Lp(a). Supporting this, individuals with high combined genetic risk for high Lp(a) have an increased risk for ASCVD, as evidenced across data from seven US-based health systems.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

However, most scientists don't have access to experts from multiple fields. Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains by answering scientific questions. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates the ability of the Virtual Lab to rapidly make impactful, real-world scientific discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1{beta} activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirms that IL-1{beta} significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spreading in the lung epithelia. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1{beta} on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Methods Data linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex. Results The most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed. High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes. Discussion Groups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death. Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Nearly half of them associated strongly with known regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers, often at conserved motif matches and co-localizing with each other. Surprisingly, the other half often associated with genomic dark matter, at largely unique sites, via intrinsic sequence recognition. Dozens of these, which we term ""Dark TFs"", mainly bind within regions of closed chromatin. Dark TF binding sites are enriched for transposable elements, and are rarely under purifying selection. Some Dark TFs are KZNFs, which contain the repressive KRAB domain, but many are not: the Dark TFs also include known or potential pioneer TFs. Compiled literature information supports that the Dark TFs exert diverse functions ranging from early development to tumor suppression.

The study of this process often requires quantifying abundances of specific RNAs at precise subcellular locations. To analyze subcellular transcriptomes, multiple proximity-based techniques have been developed in which RNAs near a localized bait protein are specifically labeled, facilitating their biotinylation and purification. However, these complex methods are often laborious and require expensive enrichment reagents. To streamline the analysis of localized RNA populations, we developed Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion sequencing (OINC-seq). In OINC-seq, RNAs near a genetically encoded, localized bait protein are specifically oxidized in a photo-controllable manner. These oxidation events are then directly detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing and our software package, PIGPEN, without the need for biotin-mediated enrichment. We demonstrate that OINC-seq can induce and quantify RNA oxidation with high specificity in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We further show the spatial specificity of OINC-seq by using it to quantify subcellular transcriptomes associated with the cytoplasm, ER, nucleus, and the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Finally, using transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that OINC-seq allows proximity-mediated RNA labeling in live animals. In sum, OINC-seq together with PIGPEN provide an accessible workflow for the analysis of localized RNAs across different biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the ""Codebook"" data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer (https://mex.autosome.org), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Since 1997, nearly a thousand H5N1 cases have been reported in humans with a 52% fatality rate. Previous analyses have indicated specific mutations on the hemagglutinin protein that allow for this ""host jumping"" between birds and mammals (3). There are also existing evidence of recent viral strains with reduced neutralization to sera (4).

Added value of this studyThis study provides a comprehensive look at the mutational space of hemagglutinin of H5N1 influenza and presents computational predictions of the binding between various HA1-neutralizing antibodies derived from infected vaccinated patients and humanized mice and 1,804 representative H5 HA1 proteins. These analyses show a weakening trend of existing antibodies. We also confirm that the mutations found in other studies that enable zoonosis also affect binding affinities of the antibodies tested. Furthermore, through phylogenetic analyses, we quantify the avian-to-mammalian transmissions from 1959 to 2024 and show a persistent circulation of isolates between North America and Europe.

Taken together, the continuous transmission of H5N1 from birds to mammals and the increase in immuno-evasive HA strains in mammals sampled over time suggest that antigenic drift is a source of spillover risk.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings indicate that the worsening in antibody binding, along with the increase in of avian-to-mammalian H5N1 influenza transmissions are risks to public health.

Through the findings of previous studies along with the predictions reported in this study, we can now monitor specific mutations of interest, quantified by their potential impact on antibody evasion, and inform public health monitoring of circulating isolates in 2024 and beyond.

In addition, these findings may help to guide future vaccine and therapeutic development in the fight against H5N1 influenza infections in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Among a list of symptoms associated with multi-organ dysfunctions, the neurological complications are particularly intriguing, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. With the recently developed mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 stain, we are now able to model the mild COVID infection in C57BL/6 mice and study the chronic immune responses and subsequent damages in different organs long after the viruses are clearly naturally in the body. More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin.

MethodsWe identified which participants with long COVID also met the Institute of Medicine (IOM) or the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for ME/CFS at approximately 6-8 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection in two cohorts: (1) the JHU COVID Recovery cohort, which enrolled participants within 4 weeks of infection and (2) the Long-term Impact of Infection with Novel Coronavirus (LIINC) cohort, which enriched for participants with long COVID. Neither study administered ME/CFS-specific surveys, so available data elements were mapped onto each ME/CFS diagnostic criteria.

ResultsOf 97 JHU participants with long COVID, 5 met IOM criteria and 2 met CCC criteria. Of 281 LIINC participants with long COVID, 51 met the IOM criteria and 29 met the CCC criteria. In LIINC, participants with long COVID meeting ME/CFS criteria were more likely to be female and report a greater number of post-COVID symptoms (p<0.001).

ConclusionsThe co-occurrence of ME/CFS symptoms and long COVID suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of ME/CFS. ME/CFS-specific measures should be incorporated into studies of post-acute COVID-19 to advance studies of post-SARS-CoV-2 onset ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

Despite technological advancements, computational methods to link cell states with their microenvironment and perform comparative analysis across different samples and conditions are still underdeveloped. To address this, we introduce TissueMosaic (Tissue MOtif-based SpAtial Inference across Conditions), a self-supervised convolutional neural network designed to discover and represent tissue architectural motifs from multi-sample spatial transcriptomic datasets (https://github.com/broadinstitute/TissueMosaic). TissueMosaic effectively maps structurally similar tissue motifs close together in a learned latent space. TissueMosaic further links these motifs to gene expression, enabling the study of how changes in tissue structure impact function. TissueMosaic increases the signal-to-noise ratio of differential expression analysis through a motif enrichment strategy, resulting in more reliable detection of genes that covary with tissue structure. Here, we demonstrate TissueMosaic on high resolution spatial transcriptomics datasets across tissues, learning representations that outperform neighborhood cell-type composition baselines and existing methods on downstream tasks. We highlight genes and pathways in these tissues that are associated with changes in tissue structure across external conditions. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised learning to significantly advance spatial transcriptomics research.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Here, we show that excess epithelial cell death is an underlying feature of IBD that arises in patients in remission and on advanced therapy. Mechanistically, nascent inflammation reprograms epithelial cells into a macrophage-like state that promotes RIPK1-independent necroptotic signaling, then triggers iNOS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis of absorptive epithelial cells and PUMA-mediated intestinal stem cell death.

These reactions generate highly reducing conditions that can drive organic synthesis reactions potentially conducive to the emergence of life, while concomitantly generating fluids that are challenging for life owing to hyperalkalinity and limited inorganic carbon (and oxidant) availability. Consequently, serpentinite-hosted biospheres offer insights into the earliest life, the habitable limits for life, and the potential for life on other planets. However, the ability of serpentinites to support abundant microbial communities was only recognized [~]20 years ago with the discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents emanating serpentinized fluids. Here, we review the microbial ecology of marine and continental serpentinite-hosted biospheres in conjunction with a comparison of publicly available metagenomic sequence data from these communities to provide a global perspective of serpentinite ecology. Synthesis of observations across global systems reveal consistent themes in the diversity, ecology, and functioning of communities. Nevertheless, individual systems exhibit nuances due to local geology, hydrology, and input of oxidized, near-surface/seawater fluids. Further, several new (and old) questions remain including the provenance of carbon to support biomass synthesis, the physical and chemical limits of life in serpentinites, the mode and tempo of in situ evolution, and the extent to which modern serpentinites serve as analogs for those on early Earth. These topics are explored herein from a microbial perspective to outline key knowledge-gaps that should be a focus of future research.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

It remains unclear how the polymerase activity of these proteins is coordinated with their movement along the growing microtubule lattice. Previously, it was found that a L174F mutation in the N-terminal TOG domain of the 217 kDa Arabidopsis thaliana MICROTUBULE ORGANIZATION 1 (MOR1) protein impaired microtubule growth and shrinkage rates in a temperature-dependent manner. In this study, we used a homologous recombination strategy to generate stable transgenic lines expressing full-length MOR1 and mutant mor1-1L174F proteins tagged with the yellow fluorescent protein YPet. When expressed in mor1 mutant backgrounds, MOR1-3xYPet showed strong association with both the growing and shrinking microtubule plus ends, consistent with its involvement in both polymerization and depolymerization. By contrast, when expressed in a wild-type background, MOR1-3xYPet was redistributed along the microtubule lattice, microtubule growth rates were reduced, and plant growth was stunted. By quantifying fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we confirmed that MOR1 has greater affinity for the plus end than the lattice. Exploiting the FRAP technique further, we identified a positive and linear correlation between microtubule polymerization rates and MOR1 turnover at the microtubule plus end. When microtubule growth rates were reduced in the mor1-1-YPet line by shifting the temperature from 21 to 30{degrees}C and for MOR1-3xYPet under taxol treatments, MOR1s turnover was delayed. In contrast, microtubule growth rates and MOR1 turnover were hastened at 30{degrees}C or after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock out of the CLASP protein. These findings support a new model whereby MOR1 has finite processivity on the microtubule, catalyzing a limited fixed number of tubulin additions before dissociation.

HIGHLIGHTSMOR1 has high affinity for both growing and shrinking microtubule plus ends, consistent with a function in both polymerization and depolymerization events.

MOR1 has greater affinity for microtubule plus ends than the lattice, and lattice binding associated with overexpression is detrimental to plant growth.

MOR1 transiently associates with the microtubule plus end, the duration of which is tightly coupled with its polymerase activity.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

While each omics profile assists characterization of specific molecular components relevant for the studied phenotype, their joint evaluation can offer deeper insights into the overall mechanistic functioning of biological systems. Here, we introduce an approach where starting from representative traits (e.g., differentially expressed elements) obtained for each omics profile, we construct and analyze joint interaction networks. The resulting networks rely on the existing knowledge of confident interactions among biological entities. We use these maps to identify and describe central elements, which connect multiple entities characteristic for the studied phenotypes and we leverage MONET network decomposition tool in order to highlight functionally connected network modules.

Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA - a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) - we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs.

However, the molecular changes leading to exaptations remain unclear. Here, we investigated the potential of bacterial transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) to evolve exaptively, examining three global transcription factors (TFs) from Escherichia coli: CRP, Fis, and IHF. Using a massively parallel reporter assay, we mapped three combinatorially complete adaptive landscapes, encompassing all intermediate sequences between three pairs of strong TFBSs for each TF. Our results revealed that these landscapes are smooth and navigable, with a monotonic relationship between mutations and their impact on gene regulation. Starting from a strong TFBS for one of our TFs, Darwinian evolution can create a strong TFBS for another TF through a small number of individually adaptive mutations. Notably, most intermediate genotypes are prone to transcriptional crosstalk - gene regulation mediated by both TFs. Because our landscapes are smooth, Darwinian evolution can also easily create TFBSs that show such crosstalk whenever it is adaptive. Our study presents the first in vivo evidence that new TFBSs can evolve exaptively through multiple small and adaptive mutational steps. It also highlights the importance of regulatory crosstalk for the diversification of bacterial gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

However, its efficacy and resistance against JN.1 sublineages have yet to be fully characterized. Here, we first assessed the neutralizing activity of Pemivibart against a panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing contemporary JN.1 sublineages, including XEC, the fastest-growing SARS-CoV-2 strain globally, in both Vero-E6 and Vero-E6-TMPRSS2-T2A-hACE2 (Vero-E6-TA) cells. We then engineered a replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus with JN.1 spike (rVSV{Delta}G-JN.1) to select for escape variants and performed structural analyses to comprehensively map Pemivibarts escape mutations. Our results demonstrated that Pemivibart exhibited comparable neutralization patterns in both cell lines and retains broad effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 sublineages tested. However, its potency was remarkably reduced against KP.3.1.1 and XEC, with IC50 values of approximately 4.2 {micro}g/mL, about 22-fold higher than that for JN.1, as well as JN.1-derived Pemivibart-escape mutants harbouring low-frequency mutations across SARS-CoV-2 strains through mutiple antibody evasion mechanisms in Vero-E6-TA cells. Collectively, our findings underscored the importance of monitoring the clinical efficacy of Pemivibart as JN.1 sublineages continue to evolve. The escape profile of Pemivibart could provide valuable insights for forecasting and optimizing its effectiveness against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Our study uncovers that transcription factors SOX4, SOX11, and TFAP2D play a pivotal role in the development, identity, and PFC connectivity of these neurons. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the absence of transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic ExNs dramatically reduces the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum, and PIR. SOX4 and SOX11 control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing ExNs of BLC, claustrum, paleocortex including PIR, and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. While the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat behaviors, differences emerge in the manifestation of Tfap2d dosage, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and the connectivity pattern between the BLC and PFC. This underscores the significance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioral modifications reminiscent of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial ventropallial ExNs and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

However, the late onset of diseases suggests that compensatory quality control mechanisms may be engaged to delay the deleterious effects induced by compromised autophagy. Neurons expressing common familial Parkinsons disease (PD)-associated mutations in LRRK2 kinase exhibit defective autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that both primary murine neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons harboring pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the secretion of extracellular vesicles. We used unbiased proteomics to characterize the secretome of LRRK2G2019S neurons and found that autophagic cargos including mitochondrial proteins were enriched. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that autophagosomes are rerouted toward secretion when cell-autonomous degradation is compromised, likely to mediate clearance of undegraded cellular waste. Immunoblotting confirmed the release of autophagic cargos and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that secretory autophagy was upregulated in LRRK2G2019S neurons. We also found that LRRK2G2019S neurons upregulate the release of exosomes containing miRNAs. Live-cell imaging confirmed that this upregulation of exosomal release was dependent on hyperactive LRRK2 activity, while pharmacological experiments indicate that this release staves off apoptosis. Finally, we show that markers of both vesicle populations are upregulated in plasma from mice expressing pathogenic LRRK2. In sum, we find that neurons expressing pathogenic LRRK2 upregulate the compensatory release of secreted autophagosomes and exosomes, to mediate waste disposal and transcellular communication, respectively. We propose that this increased secretion contributes to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, delaying neurodegenerative disease progression over the short term while potentially contributing to increased neuroinflammation over the longer term.

SIGNIFICANCEA hallmark feature of many neurodegenerative diseases is autophagy dysfunction, resulting in the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles that is detrimental to neuronal health. The late onset of neurodegenerative diseases, however, suggests alternative quality control mechanisms may delay neuronal degeneration. Here, we demonstrate that neurons expressing a Parkinsons Disease-causing mutation upregulate the release of two extracellular vesicle populations. First, we observe the increased expulsion of secreted autophagosomes to mediate cellular waste disposal. Second, we observe the increased release of exosomes, likely to facilitate transcellular communication. Thus, we propose that increases in secretory autophagy and exosome release are a homeostatic response in neurons undergoing chronic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Here, we assayed 284 mostly poorly characterized, putative human TFs using selective microfluidics-based ligand enrichment followed by sequencing (SMiLE-seq), revealing 72 new DNA binding motifs. To investigate whether some of the 158 TFs for which we did not find motifs preferably bind epigenetically modified DNA (i.e. methylated CG dinucleotides), we developed methylation-sensitive SMiLE-seq (meSMiLE-seq). This microfluidic assay simultaneously probes the affinity of a protein to methylated and unmethylated DNA, augmenting the capabilities of the original method to infer methylation-aware binding sites. We assayed 114 TFs with meSMiLE-seq and identified DNA-binding models for 48 proteins, including the known methylation-sensitive binding modes for POU5F1 and RFX5. For 11 TFs, binding to methylated DNA was preferred or resulted in the discovery of alternative, methylation-dependent motifs (e.g. PRDM13), while aversion towards methylated sequences was found for 13 TFs (e.g. USF3). Finally, we uncovered a potential role for ZHX2 as a putative binder of Z-DNA, a left-handed helical DNA structure which is adopted more frequently upon CpG methylation.

Here we show several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in cyanobacteria and Streptomyces. While these elements have one specific transposon end sequence with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show they move using two transposon ends. Telomeres are transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems, providing a duplex substrate for mobilization of the element and the associated telomere. We identify multiple instances where telomeric transposons have replaced native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, significantly influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Moreover, multiple zoonotic infections in humans have been reported. Importantly, HPAI H5N1 viruses with genetic markers of adaptation to mammals have been detected. Together with HPAI H5N1, avian influenza viruses H7N9 (high and low pathogenic) stand out due to their high mortality rates in humans. This raises the question of how prepared we are serologically and whether seasonal vaccines are capable of inducing protective immunity against these influenza subtypes. An observational study was conducted in which sera from people born between years 1925-1967, 1968-1977, and 1978-1997 were collected before or after 28 days or 6 months post-vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Then, haemagglutination inhibition, viral neutralization, and immunoassays were performed to assess the basal protective immunity of the population as well as the ability of seasonal influenza vaccines to induce protective responses. Our results indicate that subtype-specific serological protection against H5N1 and H7N9 in the representative Spanish population evaluated was limited or nonexistent. However, seasonal vaccination was able to increase the antibody titers to protective levels in a moderate percentage of people, probably due to cross-reactive responses. These findings demonstrate the importance of vaccination and suggest that seasonal influenza vaccines could be used as a first line of defense against an eventual pandemic caused by avian influenza viruses, to be followed immediately by the use of more specific pandemic vaccines.

ImportanceInfluenza A viruses (IAV) can infect and replicate in multiple mammalian and avian species. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs primarily in poultry and wild water birds. Due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of AIV, there is a continuing risk that new IAV could emerge and rapidly spread worldwide causing a pandemic, if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. The aim of this study is to analyze the basal protection and presence of antibodies against IAV H5N1, and H7N9 subtypes in the population from different ages. Moreover, we have evaluated the h humoral response after immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine. This study is strategically important to evaluate the level of population immunity that is a major factor when assessing the impact that an emerging IAV strain would have, and the role of seasonal vaccines to mitigate the effects of a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to numerous diseases including gout, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, neuroinflammatory diseases and cancer, which has prompted the search for therapeutics that can inhibit the NLRP3 pathway.

Recent work suggested that NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) may be required for proper assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome independent of its kinase activity, and that hence reduction of NEK7 protein levels may block NLRP3 activation. Since NEK7 contains a glycine beta hairpin loop structural degron found in many targets of cereblon (CRBN) molecular glue degraders, we used this strategy to degrade NEK7 and inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome. We identified NK7-902, a CRBN glue degrader of NEK7. NK7-902 potently and selectively degraded NEK7 in human primary monocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and whole blood. Unexpectedly, full NEK7 degradation led to only partial blockade of NLRP3-dependent interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) release in these cells under different stimulation conditions, with the extent of IL-1{beta} inhibition varying greatly across donors.

Unlike most CRBN glue degraders, NK7-902 degraded NEK7 in mouse cells and efficiently inhibited NLRP3-dependent IL-1{beta} release in a mouse cryopyrin-associated syndrome (CAPS) model. By contrast, oral administration of NK7-902 in non-human primates led to profound and long lasting NEK7 degradation but only transiently blocked IL-1{beta} production in blood.

Collectively, our data suggest that NEK7 is involved but may not be strictly required for NLRP3 activation in primates and humans.

Such large-scale analyses require that the underlying infrastructure is used efficiently. In addition, any analysis should be fully reproducible and the workflow must be publicly available to allow other researchers to understand the reasoning behind computed results. Here, we introduce the Metagenomics-Toolkit, a scalable, data agnostic workflow that automates the analysis of short and long metagenomic reads obtained from Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technology devices, respectively. The Metagenomics-Toolkit offers not only standard features expected in a metagenome workflow, such as quality control, assembly, binning, and annotation, but also distinctive features, such as plasmid identification based on various tools, the recovery of unassembled microbial community members and the discovery of microbial interdependencies through a combination of dereplication, co-occurrence, and genome-scale metabolic modeling. Furthermore, the Metagenomics-Toolkit includes a machine learning-optimized assembly step that tailors the peak RAM value requested by a metagenome assembler to match actual requirements, thereby minimizing the dependency on dedicated high-memory hardware. While the Metagenomics Toolkit can be executed on user workstations, it also offers several optimizations for an efficient cloud-based cluster execution. We compare the Metagenomics-Toolkit to five commonly used metagenomics workflows and demonstrate the capabilities of the Metagenomics-Toolkit by executing it on 757 metagenome datasets from sewage samples for an investigation of a possible sewage core microbiome.

XEC, a recombinant of KS.1.1 and KP.3.3, contains T22N and F59S mutations in the spike protein's N-terminal domain (NTD). The T22N mutation, similar to the DelS31 mutation in KP.3.1.1, introduces a potential N-linked glycosylation site in XEC. In this study, we examined the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response and mutation effects in sera from bivalent-vaccinated healthcare workers, BA.2.86/JN.1 wave-infected patients, and XBB.1.5 monovalent-vaccinated hamsters, assessing responses to XEC alongside D614G, JN.1, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. XEC demonstrated significantly reduced neutralization titers across all cohorts, largely due to the F59S mutation. Notably, removal of glycosylation sites in XEC and KP.3.1.1 substantially restored nAb titers. Antigenic cartography analysis revealed XEC to be more antigenically distinct from its common ancestral BA.2.86/JN.1 compared to KP.3.1.1, with the F59S mutation as a determining factor. Similar to KP.3.1.1, XEC showed reduced cell-cell fusion relative to its parental KP.3, a change attributed to the T22N glycosylation. We also observed reduced S1 shedding for XEC and KP.3.1.1, which was reversed by ablation of T22N and DelS31 glycosylation mutations, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that T22N and F59S mutations of XEC alters hydrophobic interactions with adjacent spike protein residues, impacting both conformational stability and neutralization. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NTD mutations in shaping SARS-CoV-2 spike biology and immune escape mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

One prominent approach to forecasting such long-run outcomes is the successor representation (SR), which predicts future states aggregated over multiple timesteps. Although much behavioral and neural evidence suggests that people and animals use such a representation, it remains unknown how they acquire it. It has frequently been assumed to be learned by temporal difference bootstrapping (SR-TD(0)), but this assumption has largely not been empirically tested or compared to alternatives including eligibility traces (SR-TD({lambda} > 0)). Here we address this gap by leveraging trial-by-trial reaction times in graph sequence learning tasks, which are favorable for studying learning dynamics because the long horizons in these studies differentiate the transient update dynamics of different learning rules. We examined the behavior of SR-TD({lambda}) on a probabilistic graph learning task alongside a number of alternatives, and found that behavior was best explained by a hybrid model which learned via SR-TD({lambda}) alongside an additional zeroth-order predictive model. The relatively large {lambda} we estimate indicates a predominant role of eligibility trace mechanisms over the bootstrap-based chaining typically assumed. Our results provide insight into how humans learn predictive representations, and demonstrate that people simultaneously learn the SR alongside lower-order predictions.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Hunger increases exploration and risk-taking behavior, allowing an animal to forage for food despite risks; however, the neural circuitry underlying this change is unknown. Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animal's spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative ""hunger neurons"" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

To expedite the design process, mathematical modelling is typically employed to predict circuit function in silico ahead of implementation, which when coupled with computational optimization can be used to automatically identify promising designs. However, circuit models are inherently inaccurate which can result in sub-optimal or non-functional in vivo performance. To mitigate this issue, here we propose to combine Bayesian inference, Thompson sampling, and risk management to find optimal circuit designs. Our approach employs data from non-functional designs to estimate the distribution of the model parameters and then employs risk-averse optimization to select design parameters that are expected to perform well given parameter uncertainty and biomolecular noise. We illustrate the approach by designing robust adaptation circuits and genetic oscillators with a prescribed frequency. The proposed approach provides a novel methodology for the design of robust genetic circuitry.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

In the central nervous system (CNS), neuroinflammation is a characteristic feature underlying the onset and progression of retinal and neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting neuroinflammation to reduce neuronal cell death and protect against visual and cognitive declines is therefore a key therapeutic strategy. However, due to the complex and multi-faceted nature of these diseases, to date there has been little therapeutic success with single target approaches insufficient to tackle widespread and multi-pathway inflammatory cascades. Furthermore, as the retina and brain reside within immune-privileged environments, a major challenge in treating these diseases is producing and delivering a therapeutic that, in itself, does not exacerbate inflammation. Extracellular vesicles (EV), derived from red blood cells (RBC EV), present a promising solution to overcome these hurdles, due to their innate ability to cross blood-tissue barriers, biocompatible nature, and their broad anti-inflammatory properties to modulate complex neuroinflammatory pathways.

This study therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of RBC EV in mediating neuroinflammation using an in-vivo photo-oxidative damage model of retinal degeneration as a model for CNS neuroinflammation. In this work, we developed a novel incubation pipeline using N1 medium supplement and superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplementation to promote the production of safe, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory RBC EV. Delivery of RBC EV in vivo, was shown to be safe with strong penetration across all retinal layers. Further, therapeutic administration of RBC EV via local intravitreal injection significantly reduced inflammation and cell death and preserved retinal function. Notably, strong safety and therapeutic efficacy was also demonstrated in the retina following systemic (intraperitoneal) administration, highlighting a potential game-changing approach for less-invasive therapeutic delivery to the CNS. Finally, multi-omic analyses and in vitro findings supported an anti-inflammatory mechanism-of-action, with RBC EV modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine release, including those known to be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal and neurodegenerative diseases.

Taken together, these findings highlight the broad applicability of RBC EV in treating neuroinflammation in the CNS, presenting a scalable and effective treatment approach for these currently untreatable diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Predicted to be extinct by 2038, the orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster) is a Critically Endangered migratory bird threatened by numerous viral, bacterial and fungal diseases. The species has undergone multiple population crashes, reaching a low of three wild-born females and 13 males in 2016 and is now represented by only a single wild population and individuals in the captive breeding program. Here we used our high-quality long-read reference genome, and contemporary and historical resequenced genomes from as early as 1829, to track the long-term genomic erosion and immunogenetic diversity decline in this species. 62% of genomic diversity was lost between historical (mean autosomal heterozygosity = 0.00149 {+/-} 0.000699 SD) and contemporary (0.00057 {+/-} 0.000026) parrots. A greater number and length of runs of homozygosity in contemporary samples was also observed. A temporal reduction of the number of alleles at Toll-like receptor genes was found (historical average alleles = 5.78 {+/-} 2.73; contemporary = 3.89 {+/-} 2.10), potentially exacerbating disease susceptibility in the contemporary population. Of particular concern is the new threat of avian influenza strain (HPAI) to Australia. We discuss the conservation implications of our findings and propose that hybridization and synthetic biology may be required to address the catastrophic loss of genetic diversity that has occurred this species in order to prevent extinction.

Significance statementOrange-bellied parrots (Neophema chrysogaster) face a dire future, with extinction predicted by 2038 due to severe genetic diversity loss. This Critically Endangered species, now reduced to a single wild population and a captive breeding program, has lost 62% of its genomic diversity since 1829. Contemporary samples show a decline in immunogenetic diversity and signs of very recent inbreeding. Meaning birds today are more susceptible to disease events than birds a hundred years ago. Conservation efforts must consider hybridization and synthetic biology to counteract the catastrophic loss of genetic diversity to ensure the species survival. Our study underscores the urgent need for innovative strategies to preserve the adaptive potential and resilience of the orange-bellied parrot and other species in similar situations.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

While it is known how urea catabolism leads to biomineralization, the non-ureolytic pathways of MICP are less clear. This limits the use of the latter in biotechnology, despite its clear benefit of avoiding toxic ammonia release. To address this knowledge gap, the present study explored the interdependence between carbon source utilization and non-ureolytic MICP. We show that acetate can serve as the carbon source driving calcite formation in several environmental Bacillaceae isolates. This effect was particularly clear in a Solibacillus silvestris strain, which could precipitate almost all provided calcium when provided with a 2:1 acetate-to-calcium molar ratio, and we show that this process was independent of active cell growth. Genome sequencing and gene expression analyses revealed an apparent link between acetate catabolism and calcite precipitation in this species, suggesting MICP may be a calcium stress response. Development of a simple genetic system for S. silvestris led to deletion of a proposed calcium binding protein, although this showed minimal effects on MICP. Taken together, this study provides insights into the physiological processes leading to non-ureolytic MICP, paving the way for targeted optimization of biomineralization for sustainable materials development.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Here, we performed paired single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiling from 44 human coronary arteries. To link disease variants to molecular traits, we developed a meta-map of 88 samples and discovered 11,182 single-cell chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs). Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the greatest genetic risk for CAD. To capture the continuum of SMC cell states in disease, we used dynamic single cell caQTL modeling for the first time in tissue to uncover QTLs whose effects are modified by cell state and expand our insight into genetic regulation of heterogenous cell populations. Notably, we identified a variant in the COL4A1/COL4A2 CAD GWAS locus which becomes a caQTL as SMCs de-differentiate by changing a transcription factor binding site for EGR1/2. To unbiasedly prioritize functional candidate genes, we built a genome-wide single cell variant to enhancer to gene (scV2E2G) map for human CAD to link disease variants to causal genes in cell types. Using this approach, we found several hundred genes predicted to be linked to disease variants in different cell types. Next, we performed genome-wide Hi-C in 16 human coronary arteries to build tissue specific maps of chromatin conformation and link disease variants to integrated chromatin hubs and distal target genes. Using this approach, we show that rs4887091 within the ADAMTS7 CAD GWAS locus modulates function of a super chromatin interactome through a change in a CTCF binding site. Finally, we used CRISPR interference to validate a distal gene, AMOTL2, liked to a CAD GWAS locus. Collectively we provide a disease-agnostic framework to translate human genetic findings to identify pathologic cell states and genes driving disease, producing a comprehensive scV2E2G map with genetic and tissue level convergence for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of respiratory system disorders before and after the pandemic onset in individuals with and without PASC.

MethodsWe designed a case-control study was designed to investigate the prevalence of respiratory system-related diagnoses in adult, non-hospitalized PASC patients (cases) in 2019, 12 months before and 6 months after the PASC diagnosis compared to matched controls without PASC. Data was extracted from the Stockholm Regions database warehouse (VAL).

ResultsHigher diagnostic rates for common respiratory illnesses were observed among PASC patients in 2019 and 12 months before PASC diagnosis, which then slightly decreased 6 months after PASC diagnosis. PASC patients showed more pre-pandemic respiratory diagnoses compared to controls: in 2019 they had higher incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infection (OR 2.47 for males, 2.22 for females), asthma (OR 1.76 (males), 1.95 (females)), and bronchitis (OR 2.15 (males), 2.71 (females)) compared to controls.

ConclusionsThis study highlights that individuals with PASC have a higher prevalence of respiratory disorders both before and after their COVID-19 diagnosis. Notably, asthma and other respiratory conditions were more common in PASC patients compared to matched controls. Our study demonstrates that individuals with asthma are more likely to develop PASC, even if asthma does not increase the severity of acute COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms connecting respiratory illnesses and PASC.

The Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) control return of internalised cargoes to the plasma membrane, and Rab25 has been implicated in the aggressiveness of cancer by promoting invasive migration. However, whilst Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading of edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localisation to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions. We demonstrate that endogenous Rab25 vesicles coordinate the positioning of key cargoes, including the actin regulator FMNL1 and integrin beta1, with the activation of Rho GTPases at the plasma membrane to generate and maintain F-actin rich filopodial protrusions and promote cancer cell invasive migration in 3D matrix.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Using CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas13d systems, we functionally dissected the contribution of maternal versus zygotic fractions and overcame challenges of studying embryonic lethal genes. We identified differentially distributed maternal mRNAs in specific cells and evidenced the critical role of five maternal mRNAs, cth1, arl4d, abi1b, foxa and lhx1a, in embryogenesis. Further, we focused on the functionally uncharacterized cth1 gene, revealing its essential role in gametogenesis and embryogenesis. Cth1 acts as a spatio-temporal RNA decay factor regulating mRNA stability and accumulation of its targets in a spatio-temporal manner through 3UTR recognition during early development. Furthermore, Cth1 3UTR drives its spatio-temporal RNA localization.

However, a crucial phase for early organogenesis between E9.5 and E11.5 was deficient. To unveil the mystery of this stage, we present the 3D transcriptomics of mouse embryos at E9.5 and E11.5, with a widely applicable reconstruction workflow that bypasses sophisticated bioinformatic calculations.

However, it has also been suggested that innate immune responses may be triggered by viral transcription. In this study, we investigated whether an immunostimulatory RNA is produced during IAV transcription. We show that the IAV RNA polymerase can read though the polyadenylation signal during transcription termination, generating a capped complementary RNA (ccRNA), which contains the 5' cap of an IAV mRNA and the 3' terminus of a cRNA instead of a poly(A) tail. ccRNAs are detectable in vitro and in both ribonucleoprotein reconstitution assays and IAV infections. Mutations that disrupt polyadenylation enhance ccRNA synthesis and increase RIG-I-dependent innate immune activation. Notably, while ccRNA itself is not immunostimulatory, it forms a RIG-I agonist by hybridizing with a complementary negative-sense viral RNA. These findings thus identify a novel non-canonical IAV RNA species and suggest an alternative mechanism for RIG-I activation during IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Here we sought to resolve this contradiction by inducing the neuropathology commonly observed in individuals with compulsive disorders, specifically by causing neuroinflammation in the dorsomedial striatum of rats. We found that this caused rats to be excessively goal-directed, acquiring and maintaining goal-directed actions under conditions that would otherwise produce habits. Immunohistochemical findings suggested that these behaviours were a result of astrocytic proliferation and its effects on neuronal activation. We therefore investigated the role of striatal astrocytes specifically, demonstrating that chemogenetically activating the Gi-pathway in astrocytes altered the firing properties of nearby medium spiny neurons and modulated goal-directed action control. Together, results suggest that striatal neuroinflammation is sufficient to cause excessive goal-directed action control through the dysregulation of astrocyte function suggesting that individuals with striatal neuroinflammation are excessively goal-directed rather than habitual, information that could be used to direct future interventions and/or treatments.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Following a bloodmeal, mosquitoes experience significant physiological changes, primarily orchestrated by the midgut and fat body tissues. These changes begin with digestion and culminate in egg production. However, our understanding of those key processes at the cellular and molecular level remains limited. We have created a comprehensive cell atlas of the mosquito midgut and fat body by employing single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics techniques. This atlas unveils the dynamic cellular composition and metabolic adaptations that occur following a bloodmeal. Our analyses reveal highly diverse cell populations, specialized in digestion, metabolism, immunity, and reproduction. While the midgut primarily comprises enterocytes, enteroendocrine and intestinal stem cells, the fat body consists not only of trophocytes and oenocytes, but also harbors a substantial hemocyte population and a newly found fat body-yolk cell population. The fat body exhibits a complex cellular and metabolomic profile and exerts a central role in coordinating immune and metabolic processes. Additionally, an insect-specific virus, PCLV (Phasi Charoen-Like Virus) was detected in single cells, mainly in the midgut a week after the bloodmeal. These findings highlight the complexity of the mosquitos abdominal tissues, and pave the way towards the development of exquisitely refined vector control strategies consisting of genetically targeting specific cell populations and metabolic pathways necessary for egg development after a bloodmeal.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

NTVE allows monitoring of transcriptome changes in response to genetic and chemical perturbations in the same cells over time using standard sequencing workflows. NTVE can also be equipped with fusogens to deliver mRNA-encoded effectors or ribonucleoprotein gene editors from sender cells to activate gene reporters in co-cultured recipient cells.

To guarantee its propagation, the chromosome must replicate, segregate, and accommodate other biological processes like gene expression. Therefore, to understand the causal relationship between chromosome organization and biological function, it is essential to follow chromosome dynamics. Live-cell imaging of fluorescent labels allows the tracking of specific genomic locations, but the current imaging-based approaches to study bacterial chromosome organization over the cell cycle are limited in their throughput. Even with multicolor fluorescent locus labeling, the genomic resolution is insufficient to gain insights about the whole chromosome structure from a single experiment. Although sequencing-based methods like chromosome conformation capture provide high genomic coverage, they can only be done in bulk, providing an averaged static view of the chromosome structure. In this study, we address these limitations and investigate the bacterial chromosome organization by imaging fluorescently labeled loci in a library of Escherichia coli strains, following the 3D locations of 68 different loci in live cells in a single experiment. The resulting location distributions along the cells longitudinal and radial axes are used to inform a dynamic polymer model of the chromosome over the cell cycle.

The cV2F score leverages features reflecting variant-level experimentally and computationally predicted function (e.g. allelic imbalance and sequence-based deep learning models) and element-level function (e.g. predicted enhancers), and learns optimal combinations of features by training a gradient boosting model on GWAS fine-mapping results. The cV2F-annotated variants attained an AUPRC of 0.822 at identifying held-out fine-mapped variants. Variants with high cV2F scores are highly enriched for heritability (14.2x, s.e. 0.5) across 66 diseases/traits, are uniquely informative for disease heritability, and are highly predictive of variants implicated by reporter assays; cV2F substantially outperforms previous variant-to-function scores using all of these metrics.

However, current analytical approaches often rely on linear models that cannot capture the complex, context-dependent nature of methylation regulation. Here we present MethylGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on 226,555 (154,063 after QC and deduplication) human methylation profiles spanning diverse tissue types from 5,281 datasets, curated 49,156 CpG sites, and 7.6 billion training tokens. MethylGPT learns biologically meaningful representations of CpG sites, capturing both local genomic context and higher-order chromosomal features without external supervision. The model demonstrates robust methylation value prediction (Pearson R=0.929) and maintains stable performance in downstream tasks with up to 70% missing data. Applied to age prediction across multiple tissue types, MethylGPT achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods. Analysis of the models attention patterns reveals distinct methylation signatures between young and old samples, with differential enrichment of developmental and aging-associated pathways. When finetuned to mortality and disease prediction across 60 major conditions using 18,859 samples from Generation Scotland, MethylGPT achieves robust predictive performance and enables systematic evaluation of intervention effects on disease risks, demonstrating potential for clinical applications. Our results demonstrate that transformer architectures can effectively model DNA methylation patterns while preserving biological interpretability, suggesting broad utility for epigenetic analysis and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients through lysing neighboring cells via contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation the type VI secretion system, which transfers toxins into neighboring cells, increases growth by enabling the uptake of nutrients from lysing cells. In a spatially structured environment, the gradual lysis of just a few target cells allows for the growth of a new antagonist cell. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the prevalence of the type VI secretion system in natural environments, such as global oceans and soils, suggest that bacterial antagonism has the potential to substantially contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities across various ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

However, the relatively low representation of admixed populations in both discovery and fine-tuning individual-level datasets limits PRS development for admixed populations. Under the assumption that the most informative PRS weight for a homogeneous sample, which can be approximated by a data point in the ancestry continuum space, varies linearly in that space, we introduce a Genetic Distance-assisted PRS Combination Pipeline for Diverse Genetic Ancestries (DiscoDivas) to interpolate a harmonized PRS for diverse, especially admixed, ancestries, leveraging multiple PRS weights fine-tuned within single-ancestry samples and the genetic ancestry continuum information. DiscoDivas treats ancestry as a continuous variable and does not require shifting between different models when calculating PRS for different ancestries. We generated PRS with DiscoDivas and the current conventional method, i.e. fine-tuning multiple GWAS PRS using the matched or similar ancestry sample, for simulated datasets and large-scale biobank datasets (UK Biobank [UKBB] N=415,402, Mass General Brigham Biobank N=53,306, All of Us N=245,394) and compared our method with the conventional method with quantitative traits and complex disease traits. DiscoDivas generated a harmonized PRS of the accuracy comparable to or higher than the conventional approach, with the greatest advantage exhibited in admixed samples: DiscoDivas PRS for admixed samples was more statistically accurate than the PRS fine-tuned in matched or similar ancestry sample in 12 out of 16 simulated scenarios and was statistically equivalent in the remaining four scenarios; when tested with quantitative trait data in UKBB, DiscoDivas increased the PRS accuracy of admixed sample by 5% on average; yet no statistical difference was observed when tested for binary traits in UKBB where ancestry-matched data was available. For the single ancestry samples, the accuracy of DiscoDivas PRS and PRS fine-tuned in match samples was similar. In summary, our method DiscoDivas yields a harmonized PRS of robust accuracy for individuals across the genetic ancestry spectrum, including where ancestry-matched training data may be incomplete.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181586

Extensive studies have generated molecular profiles at both bulk and single-cell levels; however, systematic integration that describes tissue-wide changes as a function of cell type coordination remains challenging. This disconnect hampers our understanding of the complex multicellular interactions driving heart failure, limiting our ability to translate molecular insights into actionable therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiles from cardiac tissues of HF and control patients across 25 studies, covering 1,524 individuals and seven cell-types, to delineate consensus multicellular transcriptional changes associated with cardiac remodeling. Our analyses revealed conserved cellular coordination events involving fibrotic, metabolic, inflammatory, and hypertrophic mechanisms, with fibroblasts playing a central role in predicting cardiomyocyte stress. Further analysis of fibroblast populations suggested that their activation in HF represents a broad phenotypic shift rather than solely accumulating distinct cell states. The integration of bulk and single-cell data within our data collection indicated that transcriptional responses to HF across cell types occur independently of tissue composition. Mapping independent data into our consensus programs demonstrated that recovery after left ventricular assist device implantation aligns with molecular recovery, highlighting the clinical relevance of the multicellular molecular state. Overall, our work synthesizes independent cardiac transcriptomics studies and makes the conserved HF associated insights available, establishing a reference for detailed exploration of HF-related multicellular molecular events.

Genetic loss of either LUBAC or OTULIN causes autoinflammatory syndromes, which are associated with defects in glycogen and lipid metabolism. However, how LUBAC and OTULIN regulate metabolic signalling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LUBAC promotes, while OTULIN restricts, activation of the key metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cells, mice, and human samples. LUBAC and OTULIN interact with AMPK, control its M1-ubiquitination, and regulate its activation in response to glucose starvation and allosteric activation. During starvation, LUBAC deficiency impairs autophagy induction and hinders the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Strikingly, LUBAC-deficient Drosophila have a strongly reduced survival rate after starvation. Our work identifies LUBAC and OTULIN as physiological regulators of AMPK, providing the first mechanism by which M1-linked ubiquitin chains regulate metabolic signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

Glutamate is released preferentially at lower firing rates with minimal release at higher firing rates, whereas neuropeptides are released at higher firing rates, resulting in frequency-dependent switching of transmitters. Aversive stimuli evoke high frequency responses with accompanying neuropeptide release to encode negative valence, whereas appetitive stimuli evoke low frequency responses with glutamate release to encode positive valence.

We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro.

While novel predictors successfully predicted binding to frequently observed epitopes, all methods failed for less observed epitopes. Further, we detected a strong bias in the prediction scores between different epitope classes. We envision this benchmark to guide researchers in their choice of a predictor for a given setting.

Our analysis indicates that YIP3, a target gene of Ino2/Ino4, exerts a negative regulatory impact on COPII-mediated vesicle transport.

To better understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, it is essential to determine whether it is primary or secondary (or recall). The analysis of highly granular immunological variable trajectories of a homogeneous cohort of patients receiving standardised medical care should discern between primary and secondary responses.

MethodsThis is a prospective cohort study of 191 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases and 44 healthy controls from the second wave of COVID-19 in the Barcelona area. The study stratified patients by severity and analysed the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and multiple immune variables for features associated with primary and recall immune responses.

FindingsIsotype-specific antibody trajectories to SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed a pattern of recall response in 94{middle dot}2% of cases. In these cases, the detailed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cells, cTfh high-resolution subsets, and cytokines were consistent with a secondary response. The transcriptomic data indicated that this cohort is strictly comparable to contemporary cohorts.

ConclusionsIn most cases, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a recall response. This opens the possibility that most COVID-19 cases are subjected to immune imprinting by endemic coronavirus, which, in turn, can contribute to severity by interfering with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and by antibody-dependent enhancement. Considering the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 secondary provides a better perspective to interpret COVID-19 pathology.

The ability of engineered cells to traffic to and function at specific anatomical locations is a major aspect of their performance. However, there is a lack of non-invasive, non-ionizing, cost-accessible methods to track these therapies inside the body and ensure proper function. Here, we establish a platform for in vivo imaging of primary cell therapies using ultrasound - a ubiquitously accessible technology for high-resolution non-invasive imaging. We introduce and optimize a lentiviral delivery system to express acoustic reporter genes based on gas vesicles in primary mammalian cells such as T cells, showing that this results in robust ultrasound contrast. Additionally, we develop genetic circuits making it possible to monitor T cell activation via activity-dependent promoters. We apply this technology to primary human T cells, using it to non-invasively track their accumulation and proliferation as a targeted therapy in a mouse tumor xenograft model and compare it to invasive, terminal measures such as immunohistology. By making it possible to visualize cell-based therapies and their function inside opaque living organs with unprecedented resolution and accessibility, this technology has the potential to significantly accelerate their development and effective use.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181586

This process is guided by the accumulation of the plant hormone auxin and the polar localization of the efflux protein PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). The transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) plays a crucial role in orienting PIN1 polarity, thereby facilitating auxin-driven organogenesis. In this study, we investigated how MP regulates PIN1 polarity and organogenesis, discovering that the downstream vascular transcription factor TMO5 regulates PIN1 polarity non-cell-autonomously and promotes organ initiation in the SAM. Furthermore, we find that exogenous auxin and cytokinin can partially rescue the organ defects associated with loss of MP and TMO5 activity. Collectively, these findings uncover a novel role for TMO5 in controlling PIN1 polarity and driving organogenesis by coordinating hormonal signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Variation in the human Glp1r gene leading to altered receptor structure, signal transduction, and function might be directly linked to variable therapeutic responses in patients. A naturally occurring, low-frequency, gain-of-function missense variant, rs10305492 G>A (A316T), protects against T2D and cardiovascular disease. Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a humanised knock-in mouse model bearing the homozygous Glp1r A316T substitution. Human Glp1r A316T/A316T mice displayed lower fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance, as well as increased plasma insulin levels and improved insulin secretion compared to human Glp1r +/+ littermates, even under metabolic stress. They also exhibited alterations in islet cytoarchitecture and {beta}-cell identity under a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. This was however associated with blunted responses to pharmacological GLP-1RAs in vivo. Further investigations in several rodent and human {beta}-cell models demonstrated that the human Glp1r A316T variant exhibits characteristics of constitutive activation but dampened GLP-1RA responses. Our results are further supported by the cryo-EM analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the GLP-1R A316T structure, collectively demonstrating that the A316T Glp1r variant governs basal receptor activity and pharmacological responses to GLP-1R-targeting anti-diabetic therapies, highlighting the importance of the molecular characterisation of human Glp1r variants to predict individual therapy responses.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

However, variants of concern (VOC), often containing multiple mutations within neutralizing epitopes, confer immune evasion of the response generated by current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. To assess the immunogenicity and virus-neutralisation ability of antibodies induced by individual or combination of Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca: AZ) and Comirnaty (Pfizer: PZ) vaccines and of a hybrid immunity induced in people who were also infected with SARS-CoV-2, longitudinal sera samples of participants recruited through the David Serisier Research biobank (Mater Research Hospital) or at the University of Queensland were collected. ELISA with a panel of purified Spike proteins from ancestral, alpha, delta and omicron BA.1 and BA.2 VOCs showed significantly (by ~2 to 6-fold) reduced IgG antibody titres against Spike proteins from Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 compared to ancestral strain regardless of the number of vaccinations or presence of infection. Neutralisation assays showed reduced activity against delta and omicron BA.1, BA.5 and BA.5 VOCs. However, the differences were in general less pronounced than in the ELISA assay and some were not statistically significant, particularly after four (two AZ and two PZ) vaccinations.

Here, using marine bacterial isolates, we detected energy transfer from a carotenoid (myxol) to retinal not only in proteorhodopsin but also in the chloride ion-pumping rhodopsin. Carotenoid binding improved the light utilization efficiency of the proteorhodopsin by accelerating the photocycle, together with facilitating light-harvesting. The carotenoid-binding ability is conserved in rhodopsins of the phylum Bacteroidota, which are widely transcribed in the photic zone. These findings suggest that the distribution of carotenoid-binding rhodopsins is more taxon-specific than previously thought, thus underscoring the importance of carotenoid-binding rhodopsins that provide an extended light utilization strategy in the environmental adaptation of marine bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Protein-peptide docking has become essential for predicting complex structures. AlphaFold-Multimer, ColabFold and AlphaFold3 provided groundbreaking tools to enhance the protein-peptide docking accuracy. This study evaluates these three tools for predicting protein-peptide complex structures using Template-Based (TB) and Template-Free (TF) methods. AlphaFold-Multimer excels in TB predictions and performs moderately in TF scenarios in the prediction pool, but TF outperforms TB in the first-ranked models. ColabFold demonstrates versatility in both TB and TF settings. AlphaFold3 generates high-quality structures for more proteins, but the medium accuracy is not as good as AlphaFold-Multimer using a large model pool. We also assessed the performance of various scoring functions in ranking predicted protein-peptide complex structures. While the scoring function built in AlphaFold demonstrates the best performance, some other scoring functions, e.g., FoldX-Stability and HADDOCK-mdscore, provide complementary values. The findings suggest the potential for enhancing scoring functions targeting AlphaFold-based predictions by combining multiple scoring functions or using a consensus approach from many prediction models.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

We analysed data from five young and old adult cohorts (MRi-Share, Human Connectome Project, UK Biobank, Generation Scotland Subsample, and Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 [LBC1936]) to test the validity and utility of LBA inferred from cross-sectional MRI data, i.e., a single MRI scan per participant. LBA was simply calculated based on the relationship between total brain volume (TBV) and intracranial volume (ICV), using three computationally distinct approaches: the difference (ICV-TBV), ratio (TBV/ICV), and regression-residual method (TBV[~]ICV). LBA derived with all three methods were substantially correlated with well-validated neuroradiological atrophy rating scales (r = 0.37-0.44). Compared with the difference or ratio method, LBA computed with the residual method most strongly captured phenotypic variance associated with cognitive decline (r = 0.36), frailty (r = 0.24), age-moderated brain shrinkage (r = 0.45), and longitudinally-measured atrophic changes (r = 0.36). LBA computed using a difference score was strongly correlated with baseline (i.e., ICV; r = 0.81) and yielded GWAS signal similar to ICV (rg = 0.75). We performed the largest genetic study of LBA to date (N = 43,110), which was highly heritable (h2 SNP GCTA = 41% [95% CI = 38-43%]) and had strong polygenic signal (LDSC h2 = 26%; mean{chi} 2 = 1.23). The strongest association in our genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated WNT16, a gene previously linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, and Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study is the first side-by-side evaluation of different computational approaches to estimate lifetime brain changes and their measurement characteristics. Careful assessment of methods for LBA computation had important implications for the interpretation of existing phenotypic and genetic results, and showed that relying on the residual method to estimate LBA from a single MRI scan captured brain shrinkage rather than current brain size. This makes this computationally-simple definition of LBA a strong candidate for more powerful analyses, promising accelerated genetic discoveries by maximising the use of available cross-sectional data.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

PE remains inadequately predicted, prevented and treated. Here, we comprehensively investigated altered transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in the PE placenta and maternal cell-free RNA (cfRNA). We show that many transposable elements (TEs) in sub-families are deregulated in the gestational age-matched PE placenta. Increased expression of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) and long interspersed nuclear element 1 (L1, LINE1) subfamilies of TEs is associated with higher histone acetylation levels at their regulatory elements. A higher TE transcript level correlates with the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway, suggesting inflammation associated with PE could be due to the sensing of TE transcripts by the antiviral innate immune system. Consistent with higher TE transcript levels in the PE placentas, analysis of maternal cfRNA data revealed differential levels of TE subfamilies in PE compared to healthy controls. Machine learning-based training for TE transcripts for early prediction of PE showed a robust performance in the validation cohort, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88, 81% sensitivity, and 74% positive predictive value (PPV). Overall, we show TE deregulation in the placenta is associated with PE, and maternal cfRNA TE signature accurately predicts early diagnosis of PE, which can improve prophylaxis and obstetric outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Correspondingly, hetero- and homozygous mutations in human GCK cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (GCK-MODY) and permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM), respectively. To explore the possible utility of glucokinase activators (GKA) and of glucagon-like receptor-1 (GLP-1) agonists in these diseases, we have developed a novel hypomorphic Gck allele in mice encoding an aberrantly spliced mRNA deleted for exons 2 and 3. In islets from homozygous knock-in (GckKI/KI) mice, GK immunoreactivity was reduced by >85%, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion eliminated. Homozygous GckKI/KI mice were smaller than wildtype littermates and displayed frank diabetes (fasting blood glucose >18 mmol/L; HbA1c [~]12%), ketosis and nephropathy. Heterozygous GckKI/+ mice were glucose intolerant (HbA1c [~]5.5%). Abnormal glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and beta cell-beta cell connectivity in GckKI/+ islets were completely reversed by the recently-developed GKA, dorzagliatin, which was largely inactive in homozygous GckKI/KI mouse islets. The GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 improved glucose tolerance in male GckKI/+ mice, an action potentiated by dorzagliatin, in male but not female mice. Sex-dependent additive effects of these agents were also observed on insulin secretion in vitro. Combined treatment with GKA and incretin may thus be useful in GCK-MODY or GCK-PNDM.

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine.

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator MpGRAS7 in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. MpGRAS7 is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests MpGRAS7 is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of MpGRAS7 orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in Drosophila brains.

We introduce graphREML, a precise and powerful likelihood-based heritability partition and enrichment analysis method. graphREML operates on GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium graphical models (LDGMs), whose sparsity makes likelihood calculations tractable. We validate our method using extensive simulations and in analyses of a wide range of real traits. On average across traits, graphREML produces enrichment estimates that are concordant with S-LDSC, indicating that both methods are unbiased; however, graphREML identifies 2.5 times more significant trait-annotation enrichments, demonstrating greater power compared to the moment-based S-LDSC approach. graphREML can also more flexibly model the relationship between the annotations of a SNP and its heritability, producing well-calibrated estimates of per-SNP heritability.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181587

This repeated cross-sectional study aimed to explore the long-term health and cognitive effects of COVID-19, focusing on how virus variants, vaccination, illness severity, and time since infection impact post-COVID-19 outcomes. We examined three cohorts of university students (N=584) and used non-parametric methods to assess correlations of various health and cognitive variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, time since infection, time since vaccination, and virus variants. Our results show that some health and cognitive impairments persist, with some even progressively worsening especially fatigue in women and memory in men, up to four years post-infection, with the Wuhan variant having the most significant long-term impact and the Omicron variant the least. Interestingly, the severity of the acute illness was not correlated with the variant of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis also revealed that individuals who contracted COVID-19 after vaccination had better health and cognitive outcomes compared to those infected before vaccination. The study also discusses some limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, particularly those arising from the stronger tendency of individuals with poorer health, compared to healthier individuals, to avoid infection and prioritize vaccination. To mitigate potential bias, the study proposes focusing on factors such as illness severity and time since infection or vaccination when analyzing persistent symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181587

Here, we demonstrate that loss of the anti-recombinase FIGNL1 retains RAD51 loading at DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in BRCA2-deficient cells, leading to genome stability, HR proficiency, and viability of BRCA2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells. Mechanistically, we directly show that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arises from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading. Furthermore, we identify that the MMS22L-TONSL complex interacts with FIGNL1 and is critical for HR in BRCA2/FIGNL1 double-deficient cells. These findings identify a pathway for tightly regulating RAD51 activity to promote efficient HR, offering insights into mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.

SignificanceProtein assemblies that span biological membranes are critical to cellular physiology. In the past decade, liquid-like protein condensates, which are flexible, multivalent protein assemblies, have been discovered on diverse membrane surfaces. Recently, we observed that protein condensates on opposite sides of a membrane spontaneously colocalize to form coupled, transmembrane complexes. Interestingly, while transmembrane coupling slows down the diffusion of membrane-bound condensates, it substantially accelerates their growth by strongly localizing interactions between them. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates may play a role in promoting the robust assembly of membrane-bound protein complexes in crowded, complex cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

However, our tools for deeply profiling how proteins co-occupy individual fibers, especially at the single-cell level, remain limited. We present Deaminase-Assisted single-molecule chromatin Fiber sequencing (DAF-seq), which leverages a non-specific double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A (SsDddA) to efficiently stencil protein occupancy along DNA molecules via selective deamination of accessible cytidines, which are preserved via C-to-T transitions upon DNA amplification. We demonstrate that DAF-seq enables [~]200,000-fold enrichment of target loci for single-molecule footprinting at near single-nucleotide resolution, enabling the precise delineation of the regulatory logic guiding neighboring proteins to cooperatively occupy chromatin fibers. Furthermore, DAF-seq enables the synchronous identification of single-molecule chromatin and genetic architectures - resolving the functional impact of rare somatic variants, as well as transitional chromatin states guiding haplotype-selective promoter actuation. Finally, we demonstrate that single-cell DAF-seq enables the accurate reconstruction of the diploid genome and epigenome from a single cell, revealing that a cells accessible regulatory landscape can diverge by as much as 63% while still retaining the cells identity.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181587

To understand the seeming paradox of how sequence variability is compatible with persistent function, we examined the functional determinants for a poorly conserved but essential IDR. We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR. Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality and interoperability of both properties and providing a much deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results provide a general framework to understand the functional constraints on IDR sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

The mechanisms imposing a different crossover landscape in female and male meiosis remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously disrupted multiple anti-crossover mechanisms in Arabidopsis and analyzed the whole genome sequence of thousands of female- and male-derived progenies. The largest crossover increase was reached in zyp1 recq4, with 12-fold in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males. Despite this unprecedented level of crossovers, fertility is marginally affected, opening new possibilities for plant breeding. Manipulating additional crossover regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further elevate the frequency of crossovers, but modified the relative contributions of the two known crossover pathways. This suggests an upper limit was reached and the two pathways compete for a large but limited set of recombination intermediates. Remarkably, while wild-type crossover distribution differs markedly between sexes, the crossover landscapes of diverse mutants in both females and males converge to a single novel profile, which we termed Crossover Potential (COP). The COP profile, which we defined using 49,482 crossovers, can be accurately predicted using only sequence divergence and chromatin features. We propose that the COP represents the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical in females and males. It suggests that the sexual dimorphism in the crossover landscape results exclusively from differential regulation of the likeness of precursors to mature into crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundances. However, large numbers of distinct k-mers make counting a memory-intensive step. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. More recent solutions, mitigate the excessive redundancy of overlapping k-mers by partially reassembling them into super-k-mers. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency.

Here we present hyper-k-mers as an alternative, less redundant, representation of super-k-mers. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new k-mer representation that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages compared to super-k-mers, by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 to 4 bits per nucleotide. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm leveraging hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose memory usage scales sub-linearly with k-mer size k, and is the fastest option when k is large.

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Also prevalent are clusters of multicopy genes for production of diverse glycoconjugates that could contribute to decoration of the host cell surface, or of putative capsid proteins that we predict multimerize into hexagonal arrays. Features including megabase-scale linear genomes with inverted terminal repeats, genomic repertoires for energy metabolism, central carbon compound transformations and translation, and pervasive direct repeat regions are shared with giant viruses of eukaryotes, although analyses suggest that these parallels arose via convergent evolution. If Borgs are giant archaeal viruses they would fill the gap in the tri(um)virate of giant viruses of all three domains of life.

One Sentence SummaryProtein analyses, informed by in silico protein structure prediction, revealed that Borgs share numerous features with giant eukaryotic viruses, suggesting that Borgs have a viral-like lifestyle and evolutionary convergence of large extrachromosomal elements across the Domains of Life.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

A subset of people with LC present with symptoms resembling those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The objective of this study was to compare cortisol concentrations in those with and without Long COVID, with a particular focus on people experiencing ME/CFS-like Long COVID.

METHODSWe measured plasma cortisol in 200 individuals 3-6 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Banked biospecimens collected between 8 AM-12 PM were used. Participants met the case definition for Long COVID if they had [&ge;]1 COVID-attributed symptom at least 3 months after symptom onset. People who did not report any symptoms at least 3 months after symptom onset served as recovered controls. Adapting the 2015 Institute of Medicine criteria for ME/CFS, we further defined those with LC resembling ME/CFS (LC-ME).

RESULTSWe found no difference in overall morning cortisol concentrations between people with LC (n=144) and those who fully recovered (n=56) (median 8.9 {micro}g/dL vs. 8.8 {micro}g/dL, p=0.97). Analyses of samples collected between 8-10 AM, however, revealed that, compared to those who fully recovered, cortisol concentrations were lower between 8-9 AM for those with LC-ME (median 8.2 vs. 14.8, p=0.02), but higher between 9-10 AM for those with severe LC (>=5 symptoms) (median 12.4 vs. 8.5, p=0.009) and those with LC-ME (median 13.7 vs. 8.5, p=0.02).

CONCLUSIONWe found no difference in overall morning plasma cortisol concentrations between those with and without Long COVID. Although our data could be suggestive of altered morning cortisol dynamics in a subset of people with Long COVID, longitudinal measures of cortisol in individuals with Long COVID will be critical to further inform the biology of the condition.","NA","medrxiv",1731622181587

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages, viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phages benefit1-5. One such gene is nblA which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6-9. Under nutrient deprivation the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome10-12, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks12, serving as a survival mechanism13. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation9,7,6. However, the benefit of the cyanophage-encoded NblA for the cyanophage and the broader impact on the host are unknown. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for cyanophages14, we reveal that cyanophage NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other photosynthetic proteins and reduces host photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and compose 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in the surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of the nblA gene to the cyanophage while exerting a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that nblA-encoding cyanophages have a global effect on the amount of light harvested by oceanic picocyanobacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

It is found in amphibians, reptiles, and birds, as well as monotreme and marsupial mammals but is absent in fish and eutherian mammals. To explore the potential evolutionary origins of the double cone, we analyzed single-cell and -nucleus transcriptomic atlases of photoreceptors from six vertebrate species: zebrafish, chicken, lizard, opossum, ground squirrel, and human. Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red[-&gt;] green[-&gt;] blue[-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1731622181587

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.
