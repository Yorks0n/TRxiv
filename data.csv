One possible explanation, known as the great plate count anomaly, is metabolic dependencies among community members. However, systematic studies of these interactions in communities like soil are missing, hindering advances in understanding these ecologically important ecosystems. Here, we address this issue by systematically analysing 6,931 bacterial isolates of 27 soil microbial communities. We find that the growth of up to 50% of all community members depended essentially on supplementation with amino acids, vitamins, or nucleotides. In 73% of cases, supplementation with multiple amino acids was necessary. Genomic analysis of 62 strains revealed that accumulation of insertion sequences and specific gene loss was associated with the observed auxotrophies. Finally, genome-scale metabolic models, computational analyses, and cocultivation experiments demonstrated that other co-occurring genotypes complemented the metabolic needs of auxotrophs, thus facilitating their growth. Our results demonstrate that soil bacteria exist within integrated metabolic networks, which hampers their cultivation.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Admission H3.1 levels were higher in patients with septic shock than with sepsis (median 921.84 vs 432.71 ng/mL; 38 p<0.001). Admission H3.1 levels were higher in non-survivors, and in a univariate Cox analysis, each log-10 increase in H3.1 was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.41 to 2.47, p<0.05). H3.1 was also higher in patients requiring renal replacement therapy with septic shock vs sepsis (1832 ng/mL vs 801.4 ng/mL, p=0.01) and demonstrated a dose-response relationship with the severity of AKI.

In areas with lower UV radiation, light pigmentation alleles increased in frequency because of their adaptive advantage and of other contingent factors such as migration and drift. However, the tempo and mode of their spread is not known. Phenotypic inference from ancient DNA is complicated, both because these traits are polygenic, and because of low sequence depth. We evaluated the effects of the latter by randomly removing reads in two high-coverage ancient samples, the Paleolithic Ust-Ishim from Russia and the Mesolithic SF12 from Sweden. We could thus compare three approaches to pigmentation inference, concluding that, for subop-timal levels of coverage (<8x), a probabilistic method estimating genotype likelihoods leads to the most robust predictions. We then applied that protocol to 348 ancient genomes from Eura-sia, describing how skin, eye and hair color evolved over the past 45,000 years. The shift to-wards lighter pigmentations turned out to be all but linear in time and place, and slower than ex-pected, with half of the individuals showing dark or intermediate skin colors well into the Copper and Iron ages. We also observed a peak of light eye pigmentation in Mesolithic times, and an accelerated change during the spread of Neolithic farmers over Western Eurasia, although local-ized processes of gene flow and admixture, or lack thereof, also played a significant role.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

However, only a minority of patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) benefit from ICI, and the determinants of response remain largely unknown. To better understand the factors influencing patient outcome, we assembled a longitudinal cohort with tissue from multiple timepoints, including primary tumor, pre-treatment metastatic tumor, and on-treatment metastatic tumor from 117 patients treated with ICI (nivolumab) in the phase II TONIC trial. We used highly multiplexed imaging to quantify the subcellular localization of 37 proteins in each tumor. To extract meaningful information from the imaging data, we developed SpaceCat, a computational pipeline that quantifies features from imaging data such as cell density, cell diversity, spatial structure, and functional marker expression. We applied SpaceCat to 678 images from 294 tumors, generating more than 800 distinct features per tumor. Spatial features were more predictive of patient outcome, including features like the degree of mixing between cancer and immune cells, the diversity of the neighboring immune cells surrounding cancer cells, and the degree of T cell infiltration at the tumor border. Non-spatial features, including the ratio between T cell subsets and cancer cells and PD-L1 levels on myeloid cells, were also associated with patient outcome. Surprisingly, we did not identify robust predictors of response in the primary tumors. In contrast, the metastatic tumors had numerous features which predicted response. Some of these features, such as the cellular diversity at the tumor border, were shared across timepoints, but many of the features, such as T cell infiltration at the tumor border, were predictive of response at only a single timepoint. We trained multivariate models on all of the features in the dataset, finding that we could accurately predict patient outcome from the pre-treatment metastatic tumors, with improved performance using the on-treatment tumors. We validated our findings in matched bulk RNA-seq data, finding the most informative features from the on-treatment samples. Our study highlights the importance of profiling sequential tumor biopsies to understand the evolution of the tumor microenvironment, elucidating the temporal and spatial dynamics underlying patient responses and underscoring the need for further research on the prognostic role of metastatic tissue and its utility in stratifying patients for ICI.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

This approach enables the quantification of relative lipid densities in membrane nanodomains. We find differential partitioning of sphingomyelin into intraluminal vesicles, recycling tubules, and the boundary membrane of the early endosome, representing a degree of nanoscale organization previously observed only for proteins. We anticipate that our Lipid-CLEM workflow will greatly facilitate the mechanistic analysis of lipid functions in cell biology, allowing for the simultaneous investigation of proteins and lipids during membrane nanodomain assembly and function.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Leading theories propose that education reduces brain decline in aging, enhances tolerance to brain pathology, or that it does not affect cognitive decline but rather reflects higher early-life cognitive function. To test these theories, we analyzed 407.356 episodic memory scores from 170.795 participants >50 years, alongside 15.157 brain MRIs from 6.472 participants across 33 Western countries. More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions. However, education did not protect against age-related decline or weakened effects of brain decline on cognition. The most parsimonious explanation for the results is that the associations reflect factors present early in life, including propensity of individuals with certain traits to pursue more education. While education has numerous benefits, the notion that it provides protection against cognitive or brain decline is not supported.","NA","medrxiv",1738274887923

Whilst aspects of quantitative agreement have been achieved for flat monolayers, the most striking features of tissue morphogenesis --- such as symmetry breaking, folding and invagination --- concern surfaces with complex curved geometries. As yet, however, characterizing such complex behaviors in three dimensions has been frustrated due to the absence of proper image analysis methods; current state-of-the-art methods almost exclusively rely on two-dimensional (2D) intensity projections of multiple image planes, which superimpose data and lose geometric information that can be crucial. Here, we describe an analysis pipeline that properly captures the nematic order of tissue surfaces of arbitrary geometry, which we demonstrate in the context of in vitro multicellular aggregates, and in vivo zebrafish hearts. For the former, we correlate the number of topological defects with the aggregate's surface area and verify theoretical predictions, whilst for the latter, we link biological properties to physical concepts (Laplace pressure) through spatio-temporal correlations of the heart geometry with fluorescence signals of intracellular proteins. Our analysis enables access to the 'hidden' third dimension of conventional image acquisition via stacked 2D planes and highlights how such characterizations can deliver meaningful physical insight.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception.

MethodsWe carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7th September 2022 and 6th March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type.

Findings948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99{middle dot}5% of users), brain fog (88{middle dot}3%), headaches (85{middle dot}1%) and muscle aches (78{middle dot}6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compared to the menstrual phase, most markedly the early luteal (IRR = 0{middle dot}963, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}958-0{middle dot}968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0{middle dot}985, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}981-0{middle dot}990) and late luteal phases (IRR = 0{middle dot}980, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}974- 0{middle dot}985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0{middle dot}827, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}690-0{middle dot}992) and crash incidence (OR = 0{middle dot}548, 95% CI: 0{middle dot}350-0{middle dot}856) compared to those not using contraception (n=786).

InterpretationMenstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.

A protein language model was fine-tuned on this data to correlate sequence variation with ligand binding behavior. This modeling was then used to characterize Pik-1 variants found in the 3,000 Rice Genomes Project dataset. Two variants scored highly for binding against Avr-PikC, and in vitro analyses confirmed their improved ligand binding over the wild-type Pik-1 receptor. Overall, this machine learning approach identified promising sources of disease resistance in rice and shows potential utility for exploring the phenotypic variation of other proteins of interest.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro. Murine anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs inhibited 80% of atherosclerotic plaque formation in immunocompetent mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. These studies illustrate the potential of anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs to mitigate the inflammation and plaque deposition associated with OxLDL, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for atherosclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Enhancements associated with amino acid substitutions in the viral genome, suggesting that IFITM3 limits accumulation of adaptive mutations. Mouse-adapted viruses enabled comparative studies of variants in mice.

The reverse transcriptase, noncoding RNA, and RT-DNA complex sequester the toxic effector until triggered by phage infection, at which point the toxin is released to induce cell death.

However, the current repertoire of experimentally characterized retrons is limited, with most retrons sourced from clinical and laboratory strains of bacteria. To better understand retron biology and natural diversity, and to expand the current toolbox of retron-based genome editors, we developed a pipeline to isolate retrons and their bacterial hosts from a variety of environmental samples. Here, we present six of these novel retrons, each isolated from a different host bacterium. We characterize the full operon of these retrons and test their ability to defend against a panel of E. coli phages. For two of these retrons, we further unravel their mechanism of defense by identifying the phage genes responsible for triggering abortive infection. Finally, we engineer these retrons for genome editing in E. coli, demonstrating their potential use in a biotechnological application.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Understanding the relationships and evolutionary histories of different limbs is a central task, but their sheer diversity makes this a daunting if not impossible task using morphology alone. Here, the in situ expression patterns and CRISPR-Cas9 phenotypes for the five best-studied leg-patterning genes - Distal-less, Sp6-9, dachshund, extradenticle, and homothorax - are described for all limbs of the crustacean Parhyale.

Crustaceans are well-suited for this task because their limbs are more diverse than those of other arthropods, and each individual possesses a wide range of limb types that are relevant to many other arthropods, living and extinct. These results will a) provide a template for understanding the genetic basis of limb construction in arthropods more generally based on the strong phenotypes that can be obtained with CRISPR-Cas9, and b) contribute to our understanding of the evolution and affinities of highly modified legs like mouthparts and genitalia using molecular methods to complement previous morphological and embryological approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

We found partial anatomical segregation between the LC->PRN and LC->BF circuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN.

The scanning statistics in selection studies are often too complicated to theoretically derive a genome-wide significance level or empirically validate control of the family-wise error rate (FWER). By modeling the autocorrelation of identity-by-descent (IBD) rates, we propose a computationally efficient method to determine genome-wide significance levels in an IBD-based scan for recent positive selection. In whole genome simulations, we show that our method has approximate control of the FWER and can adapt to the spacing of tests along the genome. We also show that these scans can have more than fifty percent power to reject the null model in hard sweeps with a selection coefficient greater than or equal to 0.01 and a sweeping allele frequency between twenty-five and seventy-five percent. A few human genes and gene complexes have statistically significant excesses of IBD segments in thousands of samples of African, European, and South Asian ancestry groups from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine project and the United Kingdom Biobank.

Despite the high efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in preventing HIV, its accessibility and uptake remain uneven across countries. This study examines the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP policies across 20 EU countries. Methods We employed a stochastic agent-based model of HIV transmission among MSM. The model incorporated data on sexual behavior, PrEP adherence and healthcare costs to evaluate the impact of five distinct PrEP eligibility policies. Outcomes included HIV infections averted, HIV-related deaths prevented, PrEP coverage, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Findings Policies by the US CDC and Belgian authorities were the most effective in reducing HIV infections and deaths, driven by higher PrEP coverage. However, the WHO policy emerged as the most costeffective across the 20 countries, despite its current use being limited to Denmark. The European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines also showed potential, although not currently implemented. In countries without PrEP reimbursement, reducing drug costs would significantly expand the range of cost-effective policy options. Interpretation Optimizing PrEP policies is crucial for reducing HIV incidence among MSM in the EU. Broad eligibility criteria maximize effectiveness, while WHO guidelines offer a cost-effective alternative in constrained economic contexts. Our findings highlight the need for policy adjustments to enhance PrEP accessibility, inform national health strategies, and achieve sustainable HIV prevention across diverse settings.","NA","medrxiv",1738274887923

While somatic hallucinations and misperceptions are common, the underlying disruptions in basic bodily self-processing remain unclear. We aimed to investigate alterations in bodily self-processing, including touch and interoception, in psychosis using a multimodal, multi-method approach. A total of 70 participants were included (35 patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders [DSM-IV F20-29], 35 age- and sex-matched controls) . Participants performed self-/other-touch-tasks and interoceptive assessments during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), evoked potentials (EP) measurements, and/or behavioral and psychophysical tests. Primary outcomes included neural and behavioral responses to self- and externally-generated sensations (touch and heartbeat). Brain activation (fMRI), spinal responses (EPs), heartbeat perception and processing (EPs), and behavioral measures were analyzed, with preregistered hypotheses. Patients demonstrated heightened neural activity during touch tasks, including increased right superior temporal gyrus activation during self-touch and heightened activity in a right temporoparietal cluster during social touch. Tactile self-other distinction impairments were evident at the spinal cord level (EPs). Behaviorally, patients showed reduced differentiation in tactile thresholds for self- vs. other-touch. Interoceptive impairments included diminished cortical responses to heartbeat signals (EPs), lower interoceptive accuracy (heartbeat detection), and reduced self-reported interoceptive sensitivity. These findings reveal pervasive sensory and self-related disturbances in psychotic disorders. Impairments in differentiating self- and externally-evoked responses, detectable as early as the spinal cord level, may contribute to higher-order symptoms of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1738274887923

Although micro-arousals are an inherent feature of both human and animal sleep, knowledge about the neural correlates of micro-arousals across the cortical column is sparse. We here developed an algorithm for automatic detection of micro-arousals based on EMG activity and used it to explore how micro-arousals modulate laminar neural activity in the motor cortex, and how this relationship is affected by sleep pressure in mice. Our analysis showed that micro-arousals were associated with a general suppression of local field potential (LFP) power across the cortical column. Slow wave activity (SWA, 1-4 Hz) immediately after micro-arousals was tightly correlated with sleep pressure and even surpassed average SWA levels during NREM sleep in sleep deprived animals. In addition, analysis of single-channel firing showed that some channels exhibited increased activity immediately prior to micro-arousals, while others exhibited decreased activity. This study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying micro-arousals and identifies a new link between micro-arousals and sleep homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

The uniformity of the feature space provides a straightforward way for AI models to learn all three billion tokens for reading the human genome as a first language. We propose a diffusion transformer, dnaSORA, for learning these features. dnaSORA has generative capacity similar to Stable Diffusion but for DNA point clouds. The model's architecture is novel because it is unified; thus, it also functions as a discriminator that uses a frozen latent representation for classification. dnaSORA transfer learns from synthetic data emulating real genome point clouds to classify misrepresented tokens in C. elegans Hawaiian data at state-of-the-art 0.3 Mb resolution. Pre-training large genome models typically requires expensive and difficult-to-obtain genomes. However, our solution provides nearly unlimited synthetic training data at negligible compute costs. Inference for new token assignments (e.g., new diseases) requires genomes from several dozen rather than thousands of individuals. These efficiencies, combined with state-of-the-art resolution, provide a pathway for rapid, massive scaling of token annotation of the entire human genome at orders of magnitude below expected costs.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Salmonella Typhimurium, a key human pathogen, exploits host and environmental pH cues to transition between planktonic, biofilm, and virulence-associated states. However, precise tools to monitor bacterial pH dynamics at subcellular resolution have been limited. Herein, we report the development and application of mCherryTYG, a genetically encoded pH-sensitive fluorophore optimized for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), enabling robust and high-resolution pH measurements across diverse conditions. mCherryTYG demonstrated exceptional sensitivity across a broad pH range (5.5-8.5) with consistent lifetime responses, and was unaffected by temperature, buffer composition, or ionic strength. Using FLIM, we characterized the pH dynamics of Salmonella across in vitro, host, and biofilm contexts. Under acidic stress in vitro, Salmonella maintained a uniform intracellular pH ([~]6.04), providing clarity on previously debated heterogeneity. In infections of HeLa cells, Salmonella existed in distinct pH environments: acidic vacuolar pH ([~]5.89) and neutral cytoplasmic pH ([~]7.10). During the late infection stage, [~]17% of the bacterial population retained an acidic pH. Biofilm studies revealed stratified pH profiles, with acidic pH near the bottom and neutral pH at the surface, mirroring patterns observed in other pathogens. In heterologous host models, pH gradients shaped bacterial adaptation strategies. In C. elegans, Salmonella experienced a progressive pH gradient from neutral pH ([~]7.10) in the anterior lumen to acidic pH ([~]6.45) in the posterior. Similarly, in zebrafish, Salmonella encountered acidic lysosome-rich enterocytes ([~]5.84) and neutral regions ([~]7.33) in the anterior gut. This study establishes mCherryTYG-FLIM as a transformative tool for studying bacterial pH regulation, revealing pH as a critical modulator of Salmonella lifestyle transitions: virulence, and persistence. Our findings provide new insights into host-microbe interactions and present pH as a promising target for therapeutic interventions against bacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Coupling a polarizable force-field to enhanced sampling, we explored at high-resolution the long-timescale structural dynamics of a complete 1M-atom STMV. RNA-free capsids exhibit remarkable stability at physiological salt concentrations, suggesting an evolutionary adaptation for capsid reuse during the viral life cycle. This observation challenges the notion that empty capsids are exclusively products of abortive assembly, positioning them instead as functional intermediates in viral reproduction. Additionally, RNA encapsidation creates electrostatic dependencies that magnesium ions mitigate, stabilizing both RNA and capsid through long-residence-time interactions with phosphate groups. Chloride ions further influence capsid permeability by modulating salt-bridge disruptions and interprotomeric interactions, with these effects being pH-dependent: enhanced at pH < 7, preserving nucleocapsid integrity, or weakened at pH = 7, facilitating disassembly and RNA release.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Using deep-learning classifiers we evaluate the information contained in readily accessible extracellular features for neuron identification.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in these processes, yet its precise role in action monitoring and outcome evaluation remains unclear. To investigate this, we developed a novel discrimination-avoidance task for mice, designed with clear temporal separation between actions and outcomes. Our findings show that ACC neurons primarily encode post-action variables over extended periods, reflecting the animal's preceding actions rather than the outcomes or values of those actions. Specifically, we identified two distinct subpopulations of ACC neurons: one encoding the action state (whether an action was taken) and the other encoding the action content (which action was taken). Importantly, increased post-action ACC activity was associated with better performance in subsequent trials. These findings suggest that the ACC supports complex associative learning through extended signaling of rich action-relevant information, thereby bridging cue, action, and outcome associations.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) subfamily of orphan nuclear receptors are major transcriptional regulators of metabolism. In mammals, ERRs have roles in regulating mitochondrial biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, as well as stem cell maintenance. The sole Drosophila ERR ortholog promotes larval growth by establishing a metabolic state during the latter half of embryogenesis. In addition, ERR is required in adult Drosophila males to coordinate glycolytic metabolism with lipid synthesis and within the testis to regulate spermatogenesis gene expression and fertility. Despite extensive work characterizing of the role of ERR in Drosophila metabolism, whether ERR has a conserved requirement in regulating stem cell behavior has been understudied. To determine whether ERR regulates stem cell activity in Drosophila, we used the established adult female germline stem cell (GSC) lineage as a model. We found that whole-body ERR knockout in adult females using conditional heat shock-driven FLP-FRT recombination significantly reduces egg production and decreases GSC number. In addition, we found that ERR activity is required cell-autonomously in the adult female germline for maintenance of GSCs; whereas ERR regulation of GSCs is independent of its activity in adult female adipocytes. Our results highlight an ancient and conserved role for ERRs in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Here, we describe an additional level of regulation beyond LexA properties that modulates the SOS response gene expression pattern. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a distinct temporal hierarchy in the induction of SOS-regulated genes in Caulobacter crescentus.

Animals in the intertidal environment show physiological and behavioural adaptations to these changes. When the acoel Symsagittifera roscoffensis is exposed to daylight during the tidal cycle, these animals are found at the surface of sandy beaches, which enhance the exposure of their photosynthetic algal (Tetraselmis convolutae) symbionts to light. Moreover, S. roscoffensis shows a strong positive phototactic displacement as well as both positive and negative geotaxis, both being evolved behavioural adaptations to enhance light-exposure for its photosymbiont.

Early-life stress can have severe and lifelong effects on Darwinian fitness. Indeed, it is well established that being reared in a larger brood impairs growth and fitness prospects of birds, but the mechanistic underpinnings of this effect are still largely unknown. Specifically, it is not well known to what extent the reduced growth and fitness prospects of nestlings reared in large broods is due to increased resource allocation to competition versus a per capita reduction in parental provisioning rate, or a combination of the two. We cross-fostered zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) chicks into small and large broods, and recorded their growth as well as the behavior of parents and offspring throughout the nestling period. As in previous experiments, growth rate was higher in small broods. In large broods, chicks begged more and parents invested more time feeding which more than compensated for the difference in brood size. We therefore conclude that the lower growth rate for nestlings raised in large broods must be attributed to increased energy expenditure on begging rather than a reduction in the amount of food received. These results suggest significant energetic costs associated with begging and raise the interesting possibility that brood size would not have negatively affected growth in large broods if chicks had not increased their begging effort due to increased levels of competition in nest.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

The mucosal layer that lines all epithelial cells organizes, cultivates, and regulates these bacterial inhabitants. Some commensal bacteria offer benefits, like improving gut barrier function, suppressing pathobiont growth, and modulating host immunity. These health benefits have fueled the popularity of probiotics, but their retention is often hindered by their low colonization efficiency and mucosal adhesion. Mucins, the primary structural components of the mucosal layer, are essential for the organization and regulation of microbial populations, promoting growth and offering sites for adhesion through their multivalent presentation of O-glycosylation. The molecular mechanisms of mucin-probiotic interactions remain understudied due, in part, to the inability to incisively manipulate native mucin sequences or the glycans they bear. In this investigation, we developed synthetic mucins with defined glycan presentations to interrogate glycan-dependent interactions between mucus and probiotic Lactobacillus species. Though synthetic mucins can dampen the effects of pathogens, toxins, and viruses, their impact on probiotic bacteria as prebiotics or binding sites is unclear. We synthesized mucin surrogates that bind to three investigated Lactobacillus species. The nutrient conditions under which bacteria were cultured influenced glycan binding preferences, suggesting mucin-probiotic interactions change with nutrient availability. The addition of synthetic mucins to native mucin increased Lactobacillus fermentum adherence. Additionally, an increase in Lactobacillus glycosidase activity indicated that native and synthetic mucins function as prebiotics, as probiotic bacteria can cleave the displayed O-glycans. Thus, synthetic mucins can cultivate target probiotic bacteria and increase adhesion as binding sites, highlighting their value as tools for elucidating native mucin functions and as promising agents for promoting human health.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Tn916 is an ICE found in several Gram-positive genera, including Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Clostridum. In contrast to the many ICEs that preferentially integrate into a single site, Tn916 can integrate into many sites in the host chromosome. The consensus integration motif for Tn916, based on analyses of approximately 200 independent insertions, is an approximately 16 bp AT-rich sequence. Here, we describe the identification and mapping of approximately 105 independent Tn916 insertions in the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. The insertions were distributed between 1,554 chromosomal sites, and approximately 99% of the insertions were in 303 sites and 65% were in only ten sites. One region, between ykuC and ykyB (kre), was a  hotspot for integration with [~]22% of the insertions in that single location. In almost all of the top 99% of sites, Tn916 was found with similar frequencies in both orientations relative to the chromosome and relative to the direction of transcription, with a few notable exceptions. Using the sequences of all insertion regions, we determined a consensus motif which is similar to that previously identified for Clostridium difficile. The insertion sites are largely AT-rich, and some sites overlap with regions bound by the nucleoid-associated protein Rok, a functional analog of H-NS of Gram-negative bacteria. Rok functions as a negative regulator of at least some horizontally acquired genes.

In contrast, spatial transcriptomics captures both spatial and transcriptional information but is limited by resolution, sensitivity, or feasibility. No single technology combines both the high spatial resolution and deep transcriptomic profiling at the single-cell level without trade-offs. Spatial mapping tools that integrate scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data are crucial to bridge this gap. However, we found that Tangram, one of the most prominent spatial mapping tools, provides inconsistent results over repeated runs.

ResultsWe refine Tangram to achieve more consistent cell mappings and investigate the challenges that arise from data characteristics. We find that the mapping quality depends on the gene expression sparsity. To address this, we (1) train the model on an informative gene subset, (2) apply cell filtering, (3) introduce several forms of regularization, and (4) incorporate neighborhood information. Evaluations on real and simulated mouse datasets demonstrate that this approach improves both gene expression prediction and cell mapping. Consistent cell mapping strengthens the reliability of the projection of cell annotations and features into space, gene imputation, and correction of low-quality measurements. Our pipeline, which includes gene set and hyperparameter selection, can serve as guidance for applying Tangram on other datasets, while our benchmarking framework with data simulation and inconsistency metrics is useful for evaluating other tools or Tangram modifications.

However, seeds stored for long periods of time slowly deteriorate and lose viability. While seed longevity is known to vary between species, the extent of variability within species and the factors driving it remain unclear.

MethodsWe focused on both inter- and intraspecific variability in seed longevity and its determinants. We studied 41 common grassland species and 188 seed accessions from across Europe. We exposed the seeds to artificial ageing conditions (60% RH, 45{degrees}C) and estimated the seed longevity (p50), defined as the time required for viability to decline to 50% of the initial viability. We then tested the relationships between seed longevity and both species- and origin-specific factors.

ResultsVariability in seed longevity was only slightly greater between species than within species, with species identity explaining 51.9% of the total variation in seed longevity among seed accessions, leaving 48.1% of the variation within species. In interspecific species comparison, seed viability was predicted only by initial seed viability, but unrelated to species-specific seed mass or seed chemical composition. Within species, seed longevity increased with the initial viability of the seed accession and mean annual temperature at the accession origin, but was unrelated to seed mass or precipitation in the origin, and the residual variance was substantial.

Disulfide bond (DSB) formation is crucial for the folding of cell envelope proteins. The DSB pathway in mycobacteria includes two enzymes, DsbA and VKOR, required for survival. Using bioinformatics and cysteine profiling proteomics, we identified cell envelope proteins dependent on DSBs. We validated via in vivo alkylation that key proteins like LamA (MmpS3), PstP, LpqW, and EmbB rely on DSBs for stability. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of VKOR results in phenotypes similar to those of {Delta}vkor. Thus, targeting DsbA-VKOR systems could compromise both cell division and mycomembrane integrity. These findings emphasize the potential of DSB inhibition as a novel strategy to combat mycobacterial infections.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

The approach has been successful in pinpointing risk genes for various diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and different types of cancers. TWAS typically involves two key steps: imputation and association analysis. In the imputation step, the original PrediXcan employs the elastic-net model, while subsequent research endeavors have delved into more intricate models such as FUSION and TIGAR. Despite these advancements, the existing individual methods may not capture the intricate genotype-expression relationships in a comprehensive way. Given the complexity of genetic contributions of genotypes to gene expression, sophisticated modeling techniques are imperative. In response to this, we have introduced Aggregated-TWAS (A-TWAS), a comprehensive tool that amalgamates multiple imputation models to accommodate diverse genetic architectures. A-TWAS utilizes several continuous shrinkage priors, including Laplace, Horseshoe, and Horseshoe+, to ensure precise imputation results while incorporating the benefits of Bayesian variable selection methods. In the association phase of TWAS, we employ the aggregated Cauchy association test (ACAT) to obtain an omnibus p-value. Result: We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-TWAS through comprehensive simulations and real data analyses. Simulation studies highlight that A-TWAS produces substantial improvements in predictive R^2 and statistical power, while maintaining the type error I at a low level. Furthermore, TWASs are conducted on schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms datasets. In comparison to standard methods, the Bayesian imputation model demonstrates superior accuracy, and A-TWAS, by integrating multiple Bayesian priors, identifies a notably greater number of disease-relevant genes.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Here, we utilize high-pressure NMR of lipid nanodiscs paired with molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate at the atomic scale the allosteric dialog between the lipid bilayer and a bacterial model membrane protein, OmpX. We discover that OmpX delays the gelation process by liquefying the annular shell of lipids through hydrophobic and roughness matching processes at the protein surface. Furthermore, the alteration of the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer directly impacts the energy landscape of amino acid side chains at the lipid/protein interface, but also, unexpectedly, at the protein core. Our work highlights a potential thermodynamically coupled but kinetically uncoupled allosteric pathway linking lipid dynamics with the interior of membrane proteins, directly impacting our understanding of membrane function.

Here, we present CANVAS, a computational workflow that introduces a structural lid into a minimal de novo TIM barrel to anchor catalytic residues and form an active-site pocket for enzymatic function. Starting from two de novo TIM barrels, we designed nine variants with distinct lids to form active sites for the Kemp elimination. Experimental testing identified one active variant with catalytic efficiency comparable to previously reported Kemp eliminases. Mutational analyses confirmed that the designed lid is essential for catalysis, while molecular dynamics simulations revealed the importance of lid flexibility for substrate binding. This study reports the first enzymatically active de novo TIM barrel and establishes a platform for designing enzymes from minimal protein scaffolds.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

While U. maydis induces tumors locally at sites of infection, S. reilianum systemically colonizes the host and causes symptoms in the inflorescences. To investigate the genetic basis of these differences, an interspecific recombinant hybrid (rUSH) with the mating type system of S. reilianum was generated. rUSH exhibited extensive in-planta proliferation, showing a S. reilianum-like phenotype at all developmental stages except teliospore formation. Transcriptome profiling revealed that expression of pathogenicity-related effector gene orthologs was induced in rUSH, but not in a wild-type hybrid control. Multiple transcriptome comparisons identified 253 differentially expressed one-to-one effector orthologs with distinct regulatory patterns, including cis-, trans-, and rUSH-specific regulation. Functional analysis via CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis uncovered three novel virulence factors among the rUSH-specific regulated effectors. Ultimately, rUSH facilitated to identify the transcription factor UmHdp2 as key regulator of U. maydis-induced tumorigenesis. Together, these findings highlight the utility of a recombinant, interspecific hybrid in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic differences in closely related fungal pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

In previous work, we predicted a fourth RBD epitope based on allosteric conformational perturbations measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) upon complexation with the canonical spike protein target, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). We subsequently identified a pan-neutralizing antibody (ICO-hu104) with the predicted epitope, however, as the epitope was somewhat distant from the hACE2 binding interface, and our previous work limited to the spike RBD, the neutralization mechanism was unclear. Using HDX-MS, we investigated the binding of ICO-hu104 to the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from Wuhan, Delta and Omicron variants. We demonstrate that binding of ICO-hu104 at its epitope results in an increase in deuterium uptake in the distant HR1 domain for variants of concern, which in a biological context could be indicative of destabilisation of the helices within this region, promoting S1 shedding or failure of helical extension during S2-mediated fusion. This is supported by our computational modelling, highlighting propagation of allosteric effects to the S2 coiled-coil region. Collectively, this work demonstrates an alternative neutralization mechanism for ICO-hu104 which is distinct from its first-generation predecessors and thus opens alternative avenues targeting non-RBD epitopes through assessment of allosteric perturbations.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Here, we fine-tune the mechanical environment of murine gastruloids, three-dimensional in vitro models of early embryogenesis, by embedding them in bioinert hydrogels with precisely tunable stiffness and timing of application. This approach reveals that external constraints can selectively influence transcriptional profiles, patterning, or morphology, depending on the level and timing of mechanical modulation. Gastruloids embedded in ultra-soft hydrogels (< 30 Pa) elongate robustly, preserving both anteroposterior patterning and transcriptional profiles. In contrast, embedding at higher stiffnesses (> 30 Pa) disrupts polarization while leaving gene expression largely unaffected. Conversely, earlier embedding significantly impacts transcriptional profiles independently of polarization defects, highlighting the uncoupling of patterning and transcription. These findings suggest that distinct cellular states respond differently to external constraints. Live imaging and cell tracking demonstrate that impaired cell motility underlies polarization defects, underscoring the role of mechanical forces in shaping morphogenesis independently of transcriptional changes. By allowing precise control over external mechanical boundaries, our approach provides a powerful platform to dissect how physical and biochemical factors interact to orchestrate early embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

As BCR datasets grow to be millions of sequences, using efficient computational methods becomes crucial for analyzing and understanding complex patterns within the data. One important aspect of antibody sequence analysis is detecting clonal families or clusters of related sequences, whether they come from immunization, synthetic libraries or even ML-generated datasets. Such analysis helps us to understand how sequences are evolutionarily connected, and how they might have been selected or evolved. Here we introduce deepNGS Navigator, a computational tool that leverages language models and contrastive learning to transform large datasets of antibody sequences into 2D representations. The resulting 2D maps offer an intuitive visualization of overall diversity of input datasets, which can be clustered based on the sequence distances and their densities across the map. Beyond grouping related sequences, the 2D maps can also point to evolutionary trajectories and capture mutational patterns among closely related sequences. By analyzing properties like charge, hydrophobicity, number of sequence neighbors, and read counts, the maps highlight which clusters are most promising for further investigation while also detecting anomalies or noisy sequences with higher risk. We demonstrate deepNGS Navigators utilities on various datasets, including: 1) a synthetic library from a yeast display targeting HER2, 2) a machine learning-generated dataset with a hierarchical tree structure, 3) NGS sequences from a llama immunized against COVID RBD, 4) human naive and memory B-cell sequences, and 5) an insilico dataset simulating B-cell clonal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

A key obstacle is the extracellular matrix (ECM) in solid tumors, which significantly impedes CART cell infiltration. In clinical trials, neuroblastoma (NB) has shown responsiveness to GD2-directed CART therapy, however, the failure of GD2.CARTs to effectively clear bulky disease - characterized by dense ECM - highlights the critical challenge of infiltration.

In this study, we demonstrate that GD2.CARTs exhibit a unique infiltration-restriction compared to other CARTs and endogenous T cells. A separate analysis of clinical datasets identified MMP7 and SPP1 (OPN) as candidate genes to improve the infiltration of GD2.CARTs as these were upregulated in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes.

MMP-7 and OPN overexpression enhanced CART extravasation (p < .001) and interstitial movement (p < .05) in ECM-dense environments in vitro. Overexpression of either OPN (p < .0001) or MMP-7 (p < .001) improved tumor infiltration in a xenograft model of NB. This resulted in improved tumor control (94% reduction in tumor burden, p < .05) and a survival extension in OPN-GD2.CART treated mice compared to unmodified GD2.CARTs (median of 148 days, p < .05). OPN overexpression did not increase off-target infiltration into healthy tissues or promote tumor metastasis, highlighting its potential for safe therapeutic application. Our study provides a framework for further exploration of gene modifications to improve CART infiltration and efficacy in solid tumors and identifies SPP1 as a candidate gene to improve GD2.CART treatment of bulky tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Ecdysone hormones play a crucial role in regulating the molting process of different ecdysozoan taxa. Interestingly, despite this highly conserved function of ecdysone, the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has lost the ecdysone receptor (ECR) genes and their molting appears to be ecdysone-independent. The loss of ecr has only been reported in Caenorhabditis within ecdysozoans, and the evolutionary background behind this loss has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that loss of ecr is not exceptional in Caenorhabditis, but has occurred at least three times in Rhabditina and Tylenchina nematodes. Our genome-wide analysis of 160 nematode species revealed the multiple losses of ecr and its typical heterodimer partner usp during nematode evolution. Furthermore, using genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we identified two factors that likely underlie and buffer the loss of ECR gene/function: molting regulation by an alternative nuclear receptor HR3 (NHR-23) and a lineage-specific expansion of nuclear receptors in the ecr-deficient taxa. Taken together, it is suggested that ecdysone/ECR function in nematodes is only minor or redundant. We propose a novel scenario for the evolution of molting regulation, highlighting the importance of HR3 as the potential core regulator.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Compared to their shallower counterpart, MCEs have been traditionally understudied, primarily due to their inaccessibility with traditional monitoring methodologies. In this study, we aim to provide an interdisciplinary assessment of the biodiversity of Bermudan reef fish communities from the upper/lower mesophotic interface (60 m) by utilising a combination of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). In total, 155 species from 137 genera were detected by eDNA metabarcoding whilst a total of 85 species from 53 genera were detected by BRUVs. The combined species detections totalled 182 species with approximately half of those detections unique to this study when compared to previous studies. Both methodologies found differences in -diversity between study locations, with each method independently detecting the highest species richness at the same location. The species assemblage at each location was dominated ([~]80%) by species known to occur throughout the shallow reef system and the upper mesophotic, whilst species only known to inhabit mesophotic ecosystems accounted for [~]6% at each location. These findings suggest a high level of species continuity with the adjacent shallower reef systems. The complementary nature of eDNA metabarcoding and BRUVs allows for a more accurate characterisation of fish biodiversity at the upper/lower mesophotic interface, which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and more informed management decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

Neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits also occur during aging, and notably in the absence of disease. The cerebellum, which modulates movement and cognition, is susceptible to cell loss in both aging and disease. Here, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in aged mice is not spatially random but rather occurs in a pattern of parasagittal stripes. We also find that aged mice exhibit impaired motor coordination and more severe tremor compared to younger mice. However, the relationship between patterned Purkinje cell loss and motor dysfunction is not straightforward. Examination of postmortem samples of human cerebella from neurologically typical individuals supports the presence of selective loss of Purkinje cells during aging. These data reveal a spatiotemporal cellular substrate for aging in the cerebellum that may inform about how neuronal vulnerability leads to neurodegeneration and the ensuing deterioration of behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

In zebrafish, by contrast, fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix deposition and inflammation are tightly regulated to facilitate regeneration. However, the regulatory cross-talk between fibroblasts and the innate immune system in the regenerating CNS remains poorly understood. Here, we show that zebrafish fibroblasts possess a dual role in inducing and resolving inflammation, which are both essential for regeneration. We identify a transient, injury-specific cthrc1a+ fibroblast state with an inflammation-associated, less differentiated, and non-fibrotic profile. Induction of this fibroblast state precedes and contributes to the initiation of the inflammatory response. At the peak of neutrophil influx, cthrc1a+ fibroblasts coordinate the resolution of inflammation. Disruption of these inflammation dynamics alters the mechano-structural properties of the lesion environment and inhibits axon regeneration. This establishes the biphasic inflammation control by dedifferentiated fibroblasts as a pivotal mechanism for CNS regeneration.

- With age, neural state duration increases in multiple brain regions
- This effect is strongest in the visual cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex
- The overlap between neural states and event boundaries does not decline with age
- This suggest that coarse event perception is relatively preserved with age


While life is experienced continuously, we tend to perceive it as a series of events. At a neural level, this event segmentation process has been linked to changes in neural states. An open question is whether these neural states differ with age. Participants (N = 577) from the CamCAN cohort viewed an 8-min movie during fMRI. A data-driven state segmentation method was used to identify neural state changes. To study the effects of age, participants were sorted into 34 age groups. We show that neural states become significantly longer with increasing age, particularly in visual and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. Perceived event boundaries overlapped with state changes in superior temporal and dorsomedial prefrontal regions, but there was no effect of age on this relationship. Our results suggest reduced temporal differentiation of successive neural states with increasing age. Nevertheless, preserved alignment between neural states and perceived events suggests that coarse event segmentation remains intact.","NA","biorxiv",1738274887923

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1738274887923

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738274887923
