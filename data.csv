In Drosophila, previous work has shown that fruitless and doublesex transcription factors identify neurons driving sexually dimorphic behaviour. However, the organisation of dimorphic neurons into functional circuits remains unclear.

We now present the connectome of the entire Drosophila male central nervous system. This contains 166,691 neurons spanning the brain and ventral nerve cord, fully proofread and comprehensively annotated including fruitless and doublesex expression and 11,691 cell types. By comparison with a previous female brain connectome, we provide the first comprehensive description of the differences between male and female brains to synaptic resolution. Of 7,319 cross-matched cell types in the central brain, 114 are dimorphic with an additional 262 male- and 69 female-specific (totalling 4.8% of neurons in males and 2.4% in females).

This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or the presence of male-specific arbours on neurons that are otherwise similar between sexes. Numerous circuit switches reroute sensory information to form conserved, antagonistic circuits controlling opposing behaviours.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220343/Z/20/Z;221300/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00tw3jy02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Here, we find that the promoter-proximal region is critical for cell-type specific enhancer-promoter compatibility. Using high-throughput genome-engineering in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we systematically replace the endogenous Sox9 promoter with different libraries of core and extended (i.e. full) promoters and assess their response to long-range regulatory elements in mESCs and neural progenitor cells. We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters. Our results suggest that within multipartite regulatory domains, the promoter-proximal region fulfills a facilitator-like function that filters and transmits signal from distal enhancers, ultimately conferring enhancer-promoter compatibility.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076709;101125530;813327;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IB 139/6-1;KR 5247/1-1;KR 5247/1-2;KR 5247/1-3;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Sebum-based diagnostic methods using commercial oil-blotting films have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 detection in humans, yet equivalent strategies for veterinary use remain largely unexplored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), presents a major health threat in Asia-especially in Japan, where multiple cases of cat-to-veterinarian transmission have been reported. To address the need for safer diagnostics, we sought to establish a sebum-based RNA virus detection method for cats. We designed primers that efficiently detected RNA from feline sebum while distinguishing it from human and feline DNA/RNA. Using this platform, we determined the ear to be the optimal sebum collection site and confirmed that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA can be reliably identified from ear sebum with sensitivity comparable to conventional blood-based testing. In addition, we detected SFTSV RNA from sebum samples of infected cat. Our findings introduce a minimally invasive, safe diagnostic platform for feline viral infections, reducing animal distress while safeguarding veterinarians and pet owners from zoonotic risks. This strategy marks an important step toward realizing the One Health framework by advancing the well-being of both animals and humans.","[{""name"":""Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""G-7 Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ito Foundation Research Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Kao Corporation (Japan)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/016t1kc57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

It has been instrumental in the adaptation of mammalian species to diverse environments, as reflected by its rapid molecular evolution7,8. However, the origins and evolutionary dynamics of liver cell types and their structural organization remain largely unexplored. Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data for liver cells from 17 species, spanning all major feeding strategies (herbivory, omnivory, carnivory, insectivory), great apes (including humans), placental clades (Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires), major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials, monotremes), and a bird as outgroup. Integrated with spatial transcriptomics, our data reveal that liver zonation--the compartmentalization of hepatocyte functions along the lobule, the livers fundamental anatomical and functional unit--is conserved across mammals but absent in other vertebrates. We find that zonation originated in the mammalian ancestor, driven by the emergence of WNT and R-spondin signaling from central vein endothelial cells, which activate central hepatocyte gene expression via the transcription factor TCF7L2. Despite this conserved architecture and signaling, genes with zonated expression exhibit rapid evolutionary turnover. Consistently, hepatocytes evolve fast, likely due to reduced selective constraints, enabling adaptive changes under positive selection. Alongside immune cells, hepatocytes are therefore key drivers of the livers rapid evolution and functional innovations. In great apes, we identify human-specific shifts in zonation and cell-type-specific expression linked to recent cis-regulatory changes, particularly in genes involved in lipid metabolism, likely contributing to human-specific metabolic traits. Our study uncovers the origins of a mammal-specific liver cell architecture, within which reduced constraints facilitated molecular changes underlying ecological adaptations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

This is especially a problem in children, where cancer survivors experience a subsequent high risk of bone mineral deficits and fractures, normally seen in the older population. Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health does not appear to be related to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Instead, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone. Overall, this work highlights a new approach for maintaining healthy bone ageing in cancer survivors.","[{""name"":""American Federation for Aging Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000r61a05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Hevolution/AFAR New Investigator Award in Aging Biology;""},{""name"":""National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/011kf5r70"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""APP1139763;APP1127821;APP2009940;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a ""rich"" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a ""simpler"" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow wave activity, tying MB's topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MB's neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist. Our findings build on the quest to bridge mental content and its absence with measurable brain activity and provide insights into how ongoing thinking is maintained during wakefulness.","[{""name"":""Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie RISE programme NeuronsXnets"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101007926;""},{""name"":""European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST Action"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CA18106;""},{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240102680;""},{""name"":""National Health Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1183280;GNT2037172;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23H04829;23H04830;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology (JST) Moonshot R&D Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJMS2295-14;""},{""name"":""Theoretical Sciences Visiting Program, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

We introduce the BirdsPlus Index (BPI), a novel, scalable approach that integrates monitoring data, remote sensing, and conservation-weighted species scores to quantify deviations of observed site scores from spatiotemporally explicit expectations. Using nearly 29,000 recordings from the Macaulay Library, we generated acoustic checklists with the Merlin and BirdNET sound identification models under multiple detection thresholds. We matched these acoustic checklists with species-specific conservation values (BirdsPlus species scores), then trained random forest models to predict total, site-level biodiversity (the sum of these species scores) given environmental and effort covariates. The resulting model also enabled us to map expected BirdsPlus site scores across the landscape. These scores integrate information on species' conservation status, ecological roles, and phylogenetic and functional uniqueness. BPI was calculated as the residual between observed and expected site scores, thereby providing a direct site-level measure of conservation value. Across 30 sites, we found that BPI values were consistent across acoustic models and detection thresholds, with high-scoring sites supporting regionally uncommon breeders and habitat specialists. While acoustic- and observer-based (eBird) models showed differing spatial patterns, both aligned with known ecological drivers such as urban density, elevation, and wetland cover. Our results demonstrate that acoustic checklists can be used to model expected biodiversity over time and space, and that the BPI provides a robust, interpretable metric for evaluating the ecological integrity of local sites. Beyond its immediate application to conservation planning, this framework lays the foundation for global, real-time biodiversity monitoring that leverages automated acoustic classifiers, citizen science, and remote sensing to integrate conservation value into development and management decisions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

These dynamics are central to predicting how species will respond to environmental change, particularly climate-driven shifts in plant phenology. The winter moth (Operophtera brumata) relies on synchronising larval egg hatch with leaf budburst of deciduous trees, yet whether they are locally adapted to their hosts phenology, and their capacity to track future change, remains unclear. Here, we investigated potential small-scale local adaptation of winter moths to oak tree phenology in Wytham Woods, UK, a 385-hectare woodland, within which oak budburst can vary by up to three weeks within a given year. We conducted laboratory temperature manipulation experiments using 76 clutches across six temperature treatments, and field translocation experiments using over 200 clutches. We combined these experiments with assessment of population structure from whole-genome sequencing of 59 individuals. This integrative approach allowed us to assess local adaptation in terms of phenotypic differences, fitness consequences, and genetic evidence. Temperature manipulations revealed systematic differences in the timing of egg hatching across temperature treatments at the clutch level which were linked to carry-over effects from the mothers emergence time, but unrelated to their source tree budburst timing. Field translocation experiments further showed no significant differences in survival of individuals transplanted to trees with phenology differing from their original host tree, and there was no genetic structure across the population. Together, these results reveal consistent differences in hatching phenology despite the absence of population structure, strong selection, or accordance with relative tree phenology. Our findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining close synchrony in trophic interactions at small scales, which may drive spatial variation in evolutionary responses to future climate change.","[{""name"":""UKRI Frontiers Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024520/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Using GPX1 and GPX4, selenoenzymes that mitigate oxidative stress, as reporters, we performed genome-wide knockout screens to identify regulators of selenocysteine incorporation. This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis. These findings reveal how programmed ribosome collisions enable gene regulation in response to stress.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA282036;U01CA305105;S10OD030312-01;""},{""name"":""Welch Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00np6vq88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""I-1961;""},{""name"":""Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0003xa228"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RP220309;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

We identify a previously uncharacterized allosteric site for BMS-986187, a lipid-facing pocket formed by MOR transmembrane helices 2, 3, and 4, distinct from sites occupied by other known MOR PAMs or negative allosteric modulators. BMS-986187 engages both receptor residues and a neighboring cholesterol molecule, suggesting a cooperative ligand-lipid mechanism. Our studies pinpoint residues essential for allosteric modulation, while information-theory analysis of MD trajectories uncovers specific allosteric communication pathways linking the PAM site to both the orthosteric agonist DAMGO and the G protein interface. Together, these findings redefine the landscape of MOR allosteric modulation by revealing a novel binding site, a potentially lipid-sensitive allosteric mechanism, and the molecular wiring of long-range communication within MOR.

However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health grant NIH-NINDS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2R01NS089729;""},{""name"":""Ruth L.

The Prdm12 gene encodes a conserved zinc finger transcriptional regulator expressed selectively in the nervous system. In humans, PRDM12 mutations can cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES). Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12's role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored. Here, we conducted intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.S viral vectors encoding Prdm12-GFP (Prdm12-AAV) or GFP alone (Control-AAV), observing no overt changes in mouse behavior. When examining the properties of Prdm12 overexpressing sensory neurons in vitro, we observed an increase in rheobase alongside decreased neuronal responses to capsaicin and ATP, indicating a downregulation of TRPV1 and P2X ion channels activity, respectively. We next conducted intraarticular administration of viral constructs in female mice to determine how Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating sensory neurons alters their excitability and influences inflammatory joint pain induced by intraarticular administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating neurons decreased inflammation-induced changes in digging and weight bearing, prevented inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreased macroscopic voltage-gated ion channel conductance. Our findings illustrate that Prdm12 overexpression strongly modulates neuronal excitability in adult animals, highlighting its importance in pain perception and its potential as an analgesic target.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W002426/1;""},{""name"":""Versus Arthritis"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02jkpm469"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RG21973;""},{""name"":""Walloon Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00jv65847"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PANOPP 1810123;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

We found a strong depth and taxonomic dependency of the LDGs: while mixed layer marine microbial communities exhibited pronounced gradients with a peak in diversity at (sub)tropical latitudes (40{degrees} S-40{degrees} N) followed by a decline toward the poles, the communities at depth (200-1,000 m) showed no latitudinal structuring.

Diversity structuring also varied by seasons and regions, governed by temperature, nutrients, and carbon dynamics. Together, these findings highlight that within the ocean microbiome, LDGs are not universal, but rather lineage-specific outcomes of differing ecological strategies and their responses to environmental gradients.

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

When a protein is correlated with, but not causally linked to, disease, its genetic determinants can add unwanted variability to protein-disease associations. In such cases, removing the genetic component may improve their predictive performances. Here, we tested this hypothesis by genetically adjusting 94 highly heritable proteins spanning diverse biological pathways and evaluating their associations with the onset of 37 diseases in 39,871 UK Biobank participants. Genetically adjusted proteins showed stronger associations in 88% of 1,312 significant protein-disease pairs, equivalent to a 30% median reduction in required sample size for comparable power. Of 96 protein-disease pairs with significant differences, all but one showed larger effects for adjusted proteins. Most proteins also showed consistently stronger associations with environmental and lifestyle factors once genetic effects were removed. Finally, we constructed multi-protein scores from genetically adjusted proteins and demonstrated that they significantly improve prediction for 7 diseases compared to unadjusted proteins. These findings demonstrate that removing genetic effects from plasma proteins is an effective strategy to increase power for biomarker discovery and clinical trial design, consistent with the largely non-causal role of most plasma proteins in disease risk.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760652394772

Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction. Structural and binding assays reveal conserved residues enabling cross-recognition while preserving specificity.

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

In the process, precursor cells can lose division potential in favour of differentiation, acquiring specific identities and functions. A simple example of this trajectory is in the stomatal lineage, where epidermal cells transit different stages as they differentiate into stomatal guard cells. In Arabidopsis, stomatal development is orchestrated by three closely related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE and FAMA; which act in sequential steps along the differentiation trajectory. SPCH has a key role at the onset of the lineage, where it promotes asymmetric division and early stomatal identity. At the opposite end of the lineage, FAMA enforces guard cell identity and represses additional divisions of already differentiated cells. Recent data, showing that SPCH is present until late in the lineage where it is necessary for cells to commit to stomatal fate, however, challenges this classic view. How SPCH interacts with FAMA, and what SPCHs targets are at this late stage have remained open questions. Here, we examine the role of SPCH during late stomatal development and show that relative levels and activities of SPCH and FAMA tightly control cell division and expansion. Using a cell-type-specific RNA expression approach, we identify factors downstream of SPCH and FAMA in the late lineage and characterize their temporal and spatial localization. Finally, we demonstrate that timely regulation of late transcriptional targets of SPCH and FAMA is necessary for guard cell morphology and function.","[{""name"":""NWO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""019.193EN.018;""},{""name"":""DFG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""534829971;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Its most distinctive feature is the capacity for multiplexing, which is achieved through a process known as Exchange-PAINT. This technique involves assigning orthogonal DNA strands to different targets within a sample and then sequentially adding and removing complementary imager strands that are specific to only one target at a time. However, manual Exchange-PAINT workflows are often inefficient, prone to drift and variability, and lack reproducibility.

Here, we introduce a custom compressed-air-driven microfluidics system specifically designed for multiplexed SMLM. Featuring a stackable and modular design that is, in principle, not limited by the number of channels, the system ensures robust, reproducible, and material-efficient buffer exchange with minimal dead volume. It operates in both manual and automated modes and can be readily adapted to a wide range of commercial and custom microscopes, including wide-field, confocal, STED, and MINFLUX platforms.

We demonstrate robust 5-plex Exchange-PAINT imaging in cancerous U2OS cells and, importantly, we establish multiplexed nanoscale imaging in fragile primary cardiomyocytes. These applications highlight the unique power of our platform to extend super-resolution multiplexing into physiologically relevant systems, thereby opening new avenues for biomedical research.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2067/1–390729940;SFB 1286 (project Z04);449750155 – RTG 2756;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Horizon 2020, Grant agreement No. 884488;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

To elucidate the mechanism of ROS perception by AHK5 and signaling through posttranslational modifications, a comparative phosphoproteomics analysis was conducted using ahk5 loss-of-function and wild type seedlings in response to exogenously applied H2O2. Under control and H2O2 related conditions, a rapid signaling transition from the MSP to Ser/Thr phosphorylation was observed. AHK5 appears to regulate ROS responsive phosphorylation at the plasma membrane by the modification of nanodomain components such as remorins, aquaporins, IQDs, and patellins, positioning it as a central integrator of redox signaling during adaptation to diverse stresses. AHK5 drives a distinct, ABA independent signaling pathway for H2O2 induced stomatal closure, likely by regulating phosphorylation of key components such as RBOHD, CAS, and HPCA1. Moreover, AHK5-fine-tuned root development involves ABA dependent signaling and appears to act through modulation of auxin transport via phosphorylation of auxin carrier, highlighting a mechanistic divergence between ROS responses in the shoot and root. Our data further suggest that AHK5 orchestrates stress responsive nanodomain associated signaling hubs through regulation of membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and endocytosis to mediate stress responses.","[{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRC 1101 project B05;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

With age, a dwindling ovarian reserve leads to infertility, culminating in menopause in humans. In addition to infertility, accumulating evidence has shown that age-related ovarian functional decline contributes to multisystem aging and frailty, making post-menopausal women most susceptible to an array of chronic diseases. However, due to limited tissue accessibility and lack of reliable research models, molecular drivers of ovarian aging remain poorly understood. A key barrier in the field has been the limited establishment and benchmarking of preclinical models faithfully recapitulating human ovarian biology. To address this, we curated publicly available single-cell/nucleus ovarian RNA-seq datasets from human, macaque, mouse, and goat, and processed them using a consistent and stringent pipeline. Datasets were then annotated in a harmonized fashion across studies in order to conduct a robust, integrative, cross-species analysis of ovarian aging with single cell resolution. We systematically evaluated cell-type composition, global transcriptional perturbations, gene-level changes, pathway and network features, and drug-response alignments. Across analyses, granulosa and theca cells emerged as the cell-types most affected by aging. We observed limited but promising consistencies across species, including granulosa-specific signature genes (FSHR and OSGIN2) and cell type-linked pathways, with extracellular matrix/adhesion programs in granulosa and ribosomal/mitochondrial programs in theca cells. These convergences suggest that cross-species modeling likely capture core aspects of ovarian aging. Together, our meta-analysis approach may help refine model selection, generate testable hypotheses, and cautiously inform preclinical and translational work in ovarian aging.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-323351;""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""00034120;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 40 participants; 19 T2D, 16 healthy obese volunteers (HOV), 5 prediabetes, who underwent [18F]FP-(+)-DTBZ PET to quantify vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) density (SUVR-1), T1-weighted MRI for 3D morphology metric analysis, and an arginine stimulus test to measure acute (AIRarg) and maximum (AIRargMAX) insulin responses. Lasso regression models identified the optimal combination of PET, MRI, and clinical variables to predict beta-cell function for the whole pancreas and its subregions. Results: Compared to HOV, individuals with T2D exhibited significantly reduced AIRarg and AIRargMAX. Only pancreas body volume was significantly smaller in the T2D cohort. For the whole pancreas, a model including PET-derived SUVR-1 and a subset of clinical covariates best predicted acute beta-cell function (AIRarg). However, predicting maximum functional reserve (AIRargMAX) required the addition of MRI-based morphology metrics in combination with SUVR-1 and a subset of clinical covariates. Conclusion: We combined PET imaging of BCM and MRI morphology metrics with a robust machine learning-based variable selection method to extract useful PET- and MRI-based metrics for predicting functional and not-fully functional BCM. This synergistic approach offers a novel combination of biomarkers for staging disease and evaluating therapeutic interventions.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760652394772

Here we identify Hib, a previously unrecognized family of hibernation factors widespread in Archaea. Deletion of hib in Thermococcus barophilus delays recovery from stationary phase and reduces 70S ribosome pools, establishing its role in ribosome preservation. Hib displays a unique modular architecture, combining a bacterial-like HPF/RaiA domain with a Cystathionine Beta Synthase module. High-resolution cryo-EM structures of reconstituted and in cell-extracted Hib:ribosome complexes from Pyrococcus abyssi identify three conformations encompassing the positions of tRNAs at A, P and E sites during translation. Thus, Hib acts as a hibernation factor blocking all states of the dynamic translation process, preserving the ribosome from dissociation and degradation. Our findings define Hib as a key hibernation factor in Archaea and provide a framework for understanding ribosome dormancy and adaptation across all domains of life. Beyond the discovery of Hib, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis highlights the evolutionary relationships between prevalent ribosome hibernation factors across Bacteria and Archaea.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-25-CE12-4161;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

We previously found that ER tubules are closely associated with desmosomes, but the mechanisms of ER recruitment to these adhesive intercellular junctions were unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adherens junctions recruit ER tubules to intercellular junctions in a manner dependent upon E-cadherin association with -catenin and vinculin. During cell-cell junction assembly, adherens junctions and ER appear nearly simultaneously at nascent cell-cell contacts, followed by desmosome formation. ER recruitment to cell-cell contacts allows the formation of ER-plasma membrane contact sites (ER-PMCS) and the assembly of a complex comprising adherens junctions, ER-PMCS, and desmosomes. Ablating adherens junctions disrupts this tripartite complex and perturbs global cellular lipid levels. Collectively, our findings identify cadherins as key organizers of ER-PMCS positioning and suggest that this complex integrates cellular mechanical elements with plasma membrane homeostasis.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR048266;""},{""name"":""Children's Miracle Network"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1110000016;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Using comparative long-read sequencing in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells (OSCs), we show that the LTR transposon Springer rewires gene expression by inserting into promoter-proximal introns at an AT-rich motif. Its 5' LTR initiates transcripts that splice into host exons, expanding isoform diversity without adding coding sequence. We catalog 72 Springer-driven isoforms, indicating broad mutagenic potential. In parallel, the Flamenco (Flam) uni-strand piRNA cluster undergoes structural remodeling that replaces antisense transposon fragments with forward-oriented copies, reshaping piRNA populations and eroding silencing of specific elements, including Springer. This relaxation of somatic repression creates conditions permissive for germ-cell entry, providing a plausible route to heritable genome change. Thus, Flam plasticity, contrasting with the relative stability of dual-strand clusters, mechanistically links transposon activity to genome rewiring and evolutionary innovation.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""24K18093;25H01308;24K09376;25H01305;25H01303;22KJ2696;""},{""name"":""Fusion Oriented REsearch for disruptive Science and Technology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJFR224L;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Analysis of peripheral blood-derived neutrophils from infants with RSV admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) highlighted myeloperoxidase (MPO), a hallmark of neutrophil degranulation, as a key indicator of disease severity when compared to control infants. The aim of this study is to investigate MPO as a functional readout of therapeutic efficacy. To mechanistically investigate these clinical observations, we developed a physiologically relevant in vitro model of the paediatric airway. Differentiated paediatric airway epithelial cells (AECs) were cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI), with or without an underlying layer of vascular endothelial cells. Following RSV infection, neutrophil migration and activation were assessed using flow cytometry. The inclusion of an endothelial layer enhanced physiological relevance and more accurately replicated in vivo MPO responses. To evaluate the therapeutic modulation of neutrophil activation, two antiviral compounds-remdesivir (RDV) and RSV604 were evaluated. While both compounds significantly reduced RSV viral load at 24 hours post-infection, only RSV604 attenuated MPO expression. RDV had no measurable effect on MPO levels, suggesting limited efficacy in mitigating neutrophil-driven inflammation. These findings highlight MPO as a biomarker of RSV severity and a functional readout of therapeutic impact. Targeting MPO-driven neutrophil activation may be key to reducing both viral load and inflammation.","[{""name"":""Animal Free Research UK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AFR19-20274;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V006738/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Here we show that members of all three of these lineages, as well as several other, yet uncultured and physiologically uncharacterized groups within the Thermoproteota that encode the key enzyme of anaerobic methane cycling, methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), are widely distributed in anoxic ecosystems. We postulate that the taxonomic, metabolic, and ecological diversity of methanogenic and MCR-encoding Thermoproteota is poorly understood, and that the contribution of methylotrophic and thermoproteotal methanogenesis to methane production is largely unknown. We hypothesize that thermoproteotal methanogens contribute, potentially substantially, to methane emissions in many anoxic environments that harbor methylated precursors, including wetlands, sediments, peat, rice paddies, wastewater sludge, and geothermal systems. We highlight the necessity to experimentally test the (eco)physiology of these widely distributed archaea using both culture-dependent (in vitro) and culture-independent (in situ) approaches to assess their potential contribution to methane emissions. Last, we stress the importance of remaining agnostic about the physiology of MCR-encoding Thermoproteota in the absence of experimental data because most of these archaea also carry the genetic potential to grow non-methanogenically.","[{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0025661;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394772

Here, we report that in addition to archaeal schizorhodopsins, many members of the family originate from bacteria and detail a comprehensive biophysical characterization of novel schizorhodopsins from Antarctic Minisyncoccota (Patescibacteria) and cyanobacteria, designated as paSzR and psSzR, respectively.

Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the third and sixth transmembrane helices demonstrates differential structural requirements between paSzR and psSzR. Our phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that most bacterial schizorhodopsins cluster in a single lineage distinct from archaeal variants.

We performed protein clustering using a structure-informed approach integrating AlphaFold models with sequence information to classify and functionally annotate the ORFan-rich mimivirus proteome. To map the protein-protein interaction network during morphogenesis, we employed endogenous tagging and co-immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry. This strategy revealed distinct interaction modules associated with the virion membrane, nucleoid and viral factory compartments.

Using 60 years of life-history data from over 83,000 individuals, and historical daily climate records, we show that developmental stages in wild great tits (Parus major) differ in their sensitivity to extreme climatic events (ECEs). Exposure to extreme cold events during the first week of development is particularly detrimental to fledging mass, while extreme rain events have a stronger negative impact as chicks grow older and their energetic requirements increase. Synergistic effects of ECEs and average climatic conditions can be particularly severe, exacerbating the challenges faced by these birds. Our findings indicate that combined exposure to extreme heat and heavy rainfall during early development is associated with a predicted reduction in fledging mass by up to 27%. Additionally, birth timing may further modulate these effects, since late-season broods exposed to frequent hot ECEs during early development are predicted to fledge nestlings up to 4.27 standard deviations (35%) lighter than broods laid earlier in the season. Moreover, phenotypic plasticity has enabled many similar populations to shift towards an overall earlier laying date, which may have increased susceptibility to cold extremes during development. However, our analyses suggest that the benefits of being part of an early-laid clutch within a season may, to some extent, offset the negative effects of extreme climate on fledging mass and apparent survival. In climate scenarios where ECEs are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity, these developmental stage-specific insights are crucial for understanding how climate change may be influencing wild avian populations.","[{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/K006274/1;NE/S010335/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/L006081/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Investigating MSR in invertebrates such as the western honeybee (Apis mellifera), an insect with advanced cognition, is essential to understanding the evolutionary origins and potential convergent evolution of self-recognition. We conducted two experiments using a classic mark test, applying a paint mark to the clypeus, a body part invisible to the bee without a mirror, and compared head-directed grooming between bees with and without mirror access. In Experiment 1 (n=12), without prior mirror exposure, bees did not increase their total grooming activity, although they did groom for a significantly higher proportion of time while facing the mirror. In Experiment 2 (n=9), bees with prior mirror exposure showed significantly higher total grooming activity than controls, an effect driven by an increase in grooming while facing the mirror. However, the critical test for MSR, a direct comparison of grooming while facing the mirror versus facing away from it, was not significant in either experiment's mirror group. Our findings suggest the observed behaviors are not indicative of MSR. Instead, they are better explained by simpler mechanisms, such as an orienting response to a novel stimulus (Exp 1), generalized agitation from a perceived social stimulus (Exp 2), or tactile irritation from the mark itself, an interpretation consistent with findings in other invertebrates. This exploratory research, limited by small sample sizes, provides preliminary yet inconclusive evidence. We discuss our results in the context of key methodological prerequisites for the mark test, such as mark salience, and the broader possibility that MSR-like behaviors reflect a learned perceptual-motor skill rather than an abstract self-concept. Thus, this study contributes not by providing a definitive answer, but by highlighting these critical challenges and establishing a rigorous framework for future investigations designed to disentangle these alternative hypotheses.","[{""name"":""Mita International School of Science"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Institutional Funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Traditional bulk sequencing approaches are limited in their ability to resolve genomic alterations at the resolution of individual cells. In this study, we present scVar, an integrated analytical framework designed for mutation profiling using single-cell transcriptomic data. scVar enables sensitive and robust detection of single-nucleotide variants, particularly facilitating the identification of low-frequency variants. The framework incorporates customizable filtering parameters including variant allele frequency, and provides comprehensive functional and clinical annotations for identified mutations. Furthermore, scVar includes downstream analytical modules that facilitate the joint investigation of transcriptomic and mutational profiles within single cells. Benchmarking on simulated datasets and matched tumor samples demonstrates that scVar consistently outperforms existing methods, especially in detecting variants of low abundance, and shows strong concordance with whole-exome sequencing data. Application of scVar to non-small cell lung cancer samples effectively characterized ITH across spatially distinct tumor regions and diverse cellular populations. Collectively, scVar offers an integrated platform for concurrent analysis of somatic mutations and transcriptomic data derived from single-cell RNA sequencing, providing a powerful tool for elucidating tumor evolution and the complex interplay between genomic heterogeneity and the tumor microenvironment.","[{""name"":""Genomics Data Center Operation and Maintenance of Chinese Academy of Sciences"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CAS-WX2022SDC-XK05;""},{""name"":""The Alliance of International Science Organizations"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANSO-PA-2023-07;""},{""name"":""the Open Biodiversity and Health Big Data Programme of IUBS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Males of D. santomea, a West African island endemic, distinguish conspecific sexes but court males and females promiscuously and seldom attack. Elevated intermale courtship derives from at least three changes in two separate pheromone systems. In males, the sexually monomorphic cuticular pheromone 7-tricosene promotes rather than inhibits courtship and the courtship-inhibiting olfactory pheromone cVA is reduced 84-92% compared to close relatives, including the sibling species D. yakuba. The third change is surprisingly in D. santomea females, where cVA suppresses rather than promotes sexual receptivity. The female cVA switch and male cVA reduction may have co-evolved to maintain efficient intraspecific mating in D. santomea but prevent sympatric hybridization with D. yakuba, or to reduce intraspecific aggression. We find that high intermale courtship and low cVA also co-occur and appear selectively derived in a distant monomorphic species D. persimilis, implying pheromonal and behavioral convergence in the two recently speciated taxa. The data suggest that sequential changes in the behavioral valence and levels of pheromones explain the recent evolutionary emergence of intermale sexual behavior in Drosophila.","[{""name"":""NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5R37DA031389;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Caltech Center for Evolutionary Science"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Della Martin Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Understanding which loci are particularly resilient to such forces may shed light on the traits that were important for humans throughout multiple time periods. Yet, detecting ancient selection events is challenging from modern and ancient DNA due to the data and/or signal being severely degraded. Here we use a domain-adaptive neural network (DANN) trained on simulated data and applied to ancient and modern DNA for sweep detection. We show that the DANN can account for simulation misspecification, or discrepancies between the simulations and real aDNA, thereby improving the ability to detect sweeps in real data. Application of the DANN to more than 800 ancient and modern human genomes spanning the last 7000 years recovered 16 known sweeps at loci including LCT, HLA, KITLG, and OCA2/HERC2, and revealed 32 novel sweeps. All identified sweeps were classified as hard, consistent with historically low population sizes. While some sweeps were lost over time, 14 sweeps at loci involved in a range of functions including neuronal, reproductive, pigmentation, and signaling traits were found to persist from the most ancient time periods into the most recent time periods. Notably, the same top haplotype remained at high frequency across time at 9 of these 14 sweeps. Together, these results indicate that hard sweeps predominated in ancient human history and that several ancient selective events were resilient to strong admixture events and experienced sustained selective pressures.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM151023;R35GM127070;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2240098;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

The pyrenoid, an algal biomolecular condensate that mediates one-third of global CO2 fixation, typically exists as one large condensate per chloroplast, but during cell division it transiently dissolves and reconfigures into multiple smaller condensates. Here, we identify a kinase, KEY1, in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that regulates pyrenoid condensate size and number dynamics throughout the cell cycle and is necessary for normal pyrenoid function and growth. Unlike wild type, key1 mutant cells have multiple smaller condensates throughout the cell cycle that fail to dissolve during cell division. We show that KEY1 localizes to the condensates and promotes their dissolution by disrupting interactions between their core constituents, the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco and its linker protein EPYC1, through EPYC1 phosphorylation. We develop a biophysical model that recapitulates KEY1-mediated condensate size and number regulation and suggests a mechanism for controlling condensate position. These data provide a foundation for the mechanistic understanding of the regulation of size, number, position, and dissolution in pyrenoids and other biomolecular condensates.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB-1935444;MCB-2410354;MCB-1914989;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0020195;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01GM140032-01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Prevalence estimates can inform public health investment, identify communities with high disease burden or underdiagnosis, and reveal areas of unmet clinical need.

With the advent of global-scale biobanks, genetics-based models to estimate the prevalence of disease have become viable. Autosomal recessive (AR) rare diseases are particularly tractable for this approach given that disease prevalence can be estimated from the pathogenic allele frequency (AF) in carriers from unaCected populations. Despite the usefulness of such estimates, this approach has not been validated against real-world clinical datasets at scale. Newborn screening (NBS) programs, which test newborns for a panel of neonatal diseases using quantitative diagnostic methods, provide a comparator for birth prevalence with low ascertainment bias, large sample size, and low diagnostic variability. NBS datasets thus oCer a uniquely robust benchmark to evaluate and improve the accuracy of AR genetic prevalence models.

Here we explore the feasibility, utility, and pitfalls of estimating AR birth prevalence using genetic and NBS data. We applied a genetic model to estimate birth prevalence for 28 AR diseases consistently present on NBS panels and benchmarked these against reported NBS birth prevalence in more than 12 million newborns in the United States. We found concordance between the genetic estimate and NBS was impacted by the population database used to derive AF, ancestry-matching methodology, and pathogenic variant inclusion criteria. Incorporating these refinements, we demonstrate that a genetics-first approach can provide order-of-magnitude estimates of AR disease birth prevalence for nearly all tested diseases (25/28; 89%). However, we note a general underestimate of the genetic prevalence, suggesting identifying additional pathogenic variants would improve the concordance with NBS. Further, we also assessed the impact of epidemiological and genetic variables, highlighting diseases where genetic prevalence estimates may not be suitable.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760652394773

Many cytoplasmic RNA viruses also harbor poly(A) tails on their genomic RNA and mRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infection causes cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) activity to become limiting, which preferentially destabilizes short-tailed host mRNAs, occurring before the action of virally encoded mRNA-decay factor nsp1. In this environment hostile to poly(A) tails, viral RNAs maintain a narrow tail-length distribution centering on 70-80 nucleotides across infection cycles. They do this through two mechanisms. First, viral tails are extended during RNA synthesis within double-membrane vesicles; second, viral tails are capped by a complex that includes PABPC1 and CSDE1 and slows tail shortening. Our findings suggest poly(A)-tail length is an arena of host- virus conflict, in which preserving tail lengths of viral mRNAs promotes their cytoplasmic dominance.

Tropical environments are undergoing intense rates of environmental change, and these changes may be driving large declines in genetic diversity. However, data on genetic diversity are highly skewed towards temperate regions. The degree to which diversity loss has occurred in tropical species, particularly marine species, remains an open and important question. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and museum collections of two commercially-harvested nearshore marine fishes (Equulites laterofenestra and Gazza minuta) gathered from a single location in the Philippines, spanning a century of intense environmental change. These data reveal a marked loss in genetic diversity and evidence for multiple orders of magnitude reductions in effective population size (Ne) in both species, indicating substantial genomic erosion. Such a decline highlights the long-lasting genomic consequences of anthropogenic activity and sheds light on an, until-now, invisible loss of diversity from the most biodiverse ocean region.

Significance StatementRecent reports have shown that genetic diversity in marine fishes has declined either slightly or not at all during the Anthropocene. However, almost all studies investigating marine genetic diversity loss have been from temperate latitudes, whereas tropical marine environments experience some of the most intense human impacts. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and historical specimens of two commercially-harvested fishes from the Philippines. We show that marine species in the tropics have already lost substantial genetic diversity and may have undergone severe bottlenecks over the past century. These results shine a light on the previously invisible loss of genetic diversity in the most biodiverse region of the ocean, and they emphasize the evolutionary consequences of the Anthropocene.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OISE-1743711;DEB-2343787;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

We compare four approaches: a standard additive PGS, a dominance-adjusted PGS, gradient-boosted decision trees, and neural networks. Across most scenarios, the additive PGS performed robustly, but its accuracy declined when traits had low polygenicity, high SNP heritability, and substantial dominance effects. These results delineate the conditions under which additive models suffice and highlight when more flexible machine learning methods may be advantageous.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760652394773

This study aims to explore the mechanisms underpinning such adaptability through a comprehensive genomic analysis of 22 isolates of A. johnsonii from NASAs Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (PHSF) and one carbapenem-resistant strain (E154408A) from patient colonization in Ireland. Core-genome phylogeny revealed clustering of PHSF-originating isolates in a monophyletic clade divergent from the main species lineage. Species-wide virulence-associated genes and metabolic profiling indicated the unique presence in PHSF-originating isolates of two complete efflux pumps and of a conserved allantoin racemase, suggesting adaptability for multiple environmental stresses. Observed ubiquity of blaOXA in investigated genomes (n=112) and phenotypically-validated multidrug-resistant profile of E154408A strain highlight A. johnsoniis potential as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reservoir. Plasmidome analysis suggested gain/loss events across the monophyletic population and potential AMR acquisition pathways. Genome-to-metagenome mapping identified genomic signatures of A. johnsonii in PHSF >10 years post initial isolation.

ImportanceAcinetobacter johnsonii is increasingly recognized as an emerging human pathogen, with growing evidence of its ability to persist in controlled, high-stakes environments, posing risks as both persisting environmental contaminant and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reservoir. Yet, gaps remain in our understanding of its AMR profile and the mechanisms that enable its enhanced environmental adaptability. This knowledge is necessary in contexts where biological cleanliness is a priority such as clinical settings and spacecraft assembly facilities cleanrooms, where contamination of hardware with terrestrial microorganisms is concerning. In this study, we aim to address some of key knowledge gaps by providing genomic insights into a rare multi-drug resistant clinical isolate and 22 NASA cleanroom isolates that persisted for over a decade in extremely clean conditions. Our findings will help evaluate the contamination risk of A. johnsonii in high-stakes environments and ultimately strengthen our ability to manage this microbial contaminant across terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings.

Interpretability analyses revealed Shorkies ability to resolve promoter dynamics, splicing signals, and temporal changes in regulatory motif usage.

Here, we identify that some of these immune response are differentially executed in leaves of different ages in the same plant. We observed that when compared to mature leaves, young, expanding leaves do not close their plasmodesmata, have a reduced transcriptional response to immune elicitors, and are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen. Disconnecting leaf age from physiology, we determined that both plasmodesmal closure and the magnitude of transcriptional responses are dependent on whether the leaf is a carbon sink or a carbon source. To probe the relevance of differential regulation of plasmodesmata in sink and source tissues, we forced plasmodesmal closure in young sink leaves and found this perturbed the normal outputs of growth and defence. Thus, we propose that sink leaves do not close their plasmodesmata during immune reponses to prioritise carbon use for growth over defence, and consequently that primary metabolism underpins different immune response profiles in different leaves of the same plant.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""725459;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X010996/1;BB/X007685/1;BB/Y008782/1;BB/X016056/1;""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Rotation PhD Studentship;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids responsible for vibrant shades of pink, red, and blue pigmentation, are almost ubiquitous in angiosperms but are replaced by betalains in some families in the order Caryophyllales.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, the second-largest fruit and vegetable family, characterised by white and yellow flowers and red, orange, and green fruits predominantly pigmented by carotenoids. Using a comprehensive collection of 258 datasets representing species across all 15 tribes of Cucurbitaceae and a phylogenomics approach, we observed a systematic absence of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Absence of the structural genes DFR, ANS, arGST, LAR, and ANR, along with the anthocyanin-related regulatory MYB genes, was consistently confirmed by synteny and phylogenetic analysis.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that anthocyanin loss in angiosperms is more common than previously assumed. In light of this new discovery, we propose a stepwise loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, likely accompanied by a partial functional replacement with carotenoid pigmentation.

Among the novel age-associated variants, we identified 72 carriers of a somatic mutation in the TERT promoter. Although previously reported in pan-cancer analyses, TERT promoter mutations have typically been excluded from population searches for CH. We also observed a somatic intronic insertion in UGT2B7 in 1,165 carriers, a cluster of IGH point mutations, and centromeric variation.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding.

These mechanisms were long thought to rely exclusively on ATPase or GTPase proteins, until the discovery of CTPase activity in the bacterial chromosome segregation protein ParB. In the ParABS system, CTP binding enables ParB accumulation around the centromere-like parS DNA sites to activate the ATPase ParA, thereby facilitating chromosome partitioning to daughter cells. CTP hydrolysis then releases ParB from DNA for recycling. This discovery uncovered a new regulatory principle, but the broader diversity of proteins employing a CTPase mechanism remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale survey of proteins harboring the ParB-CTPase fold across bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes. While many ParB-like proteins follow the canonical ParABS organization with ParA partners, we also identify numerous orphan homologs encoded outside of the parAB operon, frequently linked to mobile genetic elements that may have driven their rapid diversification. The ParB-CTPase folds in these divergent proteins are often fused to lineage-specific domains with diverse predicted biological activities. We further demonstrate that while many homologs retain CTP-binding, others instead bind ATP or GTP, revealing a broader spectrum of nucleotide specificities than previously appreciated. Our findings establish the ParB-CTPase fold as a widely distributed and evolutionarily versatile NTP-binding module, repeatedly co-opted through domain fusion and shifts in nucleotide specificity to enable functions far beyond the classical ParABS-mediated DNA segregation.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""221776/Z/2/Z;227755/Z/23/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Here, we discover that basal endfeet harbor a rich transcriptome including a Dynein component critical for subcellular RGC function. By purifying RGC compartments in vivo, we discover [~]3000 endfoot transcripts, including [~]800 highly enriched compared to cell bodies.

Moreover, we discover RGCs have a vast subcellular transcriptome, revealing foundational insights into how RGCs control cortical development.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37NS110388;R01NS083897;R01NS120667;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH132089;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GRFP Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Duke University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00py81415"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DST Spark Grant;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

These phage tail-like macromolecular machines puncture their target by a tube that is propelled by a contractile sheath. The mechanism underlying CIS firing, which starts with target binding and ends with sheath contraction, remains unclear.

Here, we investigate the extracellular CIS from Algoriphagus machipongonensis (AlgoCIS) by a multimodal cryo-electron microscopy approach and structure-guided engineering, which allowed us to arrest AlgoCIS in multiple intermediate states of firing. Together with the post-firing structure, our data suggest a stepwise firing mechanism involving all modules: signal propagation starts with the binding of the tail-fibers, followed by opening of the cage, an expansion of the baseplate iris, and resulting in sheath contraction and the release of cap adaptor.

Our study will serve as a framework for understanding the firing mechanism of diverse CISs and will facilitate the engineering of CISs for biomedical applications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

The surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), a group of 83 species across 6 genera, show high diversity in head, body, and propulsive fin (caudal and pectoral) shape, suggesting that morphometric analysis of these functionally relevant traits may provide insight into the ecomorphology and evolutionary history of this important fish family. Here, we develop a new multi-locus, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for the surgeonfishes based on 19 loci for 80 acanthurid species and 45 outgroups. Detailed head, body, and fin geometric morphometric data were collected for all 80 surgeonfish species in the tree, and patterns of shape evolution across the family were visualized using phylomorphospaces. We used a three-state feeding trait axis across the herbivore to planktivore continuum to examine how morphometric shape relates to diet. Head and body shape were significantly associated with diet. Additionally, species exhibited two alternative locomotor strategies: high aspect ratio (AR) tails were associated with low AR pectoral fins, slender bodies, and pelagic planktivory, whereas species with low AR tail fins had wing-like, high AR pectoral fins, deeper bodies, and were mostly benthic grazers. Using a novel phylogenetic comparative method to investigate evolutionary correlations between shapes, we found that the caudal fin had the highest evolutionary rates and covaried with both the body and pectoral fin, likely due to dietary and locomotor demands, respectively.

Plasmid dependent phages (PDPs) are particularly attractive as therapeutics because they can both kill targeted pathogen cells, whilst also potentially preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistance genes encoded by plasmids. However, we lack experimental studies of the ecological and evolutionary response of multidrug resistance plasmids against plasmid dependent phage treatment under ecologically relevant scenarios allowing plasmid conjugation. We experimentally evolved populations of E. coli carrying the multidrug resistance RP4 plasmid with the PRD1 PDP under conditions where conjugation was associated with either strong or weak benefits. When opportunities for conjugation were rare, PRD1 only transiently suppressed the conjugative plasmid population due to the rapid evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids that lacked conjugative ability. Increasing the ecological opportunity for conjugation enhanced plasmid suppression and delayed the evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids. PRD1 resistance was associated with reduced conjugative ability, but this trade-off was complex due to the heterogeneous impacts of resistance mutations on pilus production and conjugative ability. Mutations and IS element insertions in conjugation genes caused a wide range of PRD1 resistance phenotypes, ranging from complete resistance (virB4) to partial resistance (trbB, trbL). Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available IncP plasmid sequences showed that truncated variants of VirB4 protein are common in natural populations, suggesting that plasmid-dependent phages are an important selective pressure in microbial communities. Our results demonstrate an evolutionary trade-off between conjugative ability and phage resistance that cannot be easily circumvented by plasmids. Targeting multidrug resistance plasmids with PDPs is likely to drive loss of conjugation limiting the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities.","[{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W031361/1;""},{""name"":""UKRI Frontiers Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y031067/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Direct mechanistic evidence from human-relevant models remains limited. To address this gap, we exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids (COs; six independent lines) to physiologically relevant APAP concentrations (25, 50, and 100 M) for 5 days starting at day 21, a developmental stage corresponding to the late first trimester. We assessed organoid growth, apoptosis, neuronal/progenitor ratios, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and functional maturation using multielectrode arrays (2-4 months). APAP exposure did not alter growth dynamics, cytoarchitecture, or viability, with apoptosis rates remaining below 1% in all conditions. Neuronal and progenitor cell proportions were unchanged. Bulk RNA-seq revealed subtle, dose-dependent transcriptional changes only at higher doses (0 differentially expressed genes at 25 M, 9 at 50 M, and 16 at 100 M), enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways. Despite these slight molecular perturbations, electrophysiological recordings showed normal firing rates, burst frequency, and network synchronicity across exposure groups. Taken together, therapeutic APAP concentrations produced only modest transcriptional effects without structural or functional consequences in developing cortical organoids. These results align with recent sibling-controlled epidemiological studies that attribute reported associations to confounding and provide mechanistic reassurance that recommended APAP use during pregnancy is unlikely to disrupt fetal brain development.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21HD109616;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R56MH128365;R21MH128827;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00j4k1h63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01ES033636;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

However, the relationship between their catalytic activities and antimicrobial functions remains largely unknown. Particularly, few biologically relevant substrates of these proteases have been identified. Huanglongbing (HLB) has been a major threat to the citrus industry worldwide. The HLB-associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), was previously shown to deploy an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) to promote disease in citrus. In this study, we identified an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Las, LasOMP1, as a substrate of the citrus PLCP CsRD21a. LasOMP1 is one of the most highly expressed genes in Las. CsRD21a cleaves LasOMP1 and produces cleaved peptide products, which could be detected in vitro and in HLB-diseased citrus plants. We found that CsRD21a targets the N-terminal portion of LasOMP1, potentially at an extracellular loop region. Importantly, transgenic sweet orange overexpressing CsRD21a showed reduced Las titers and delayed disease symptoms, highlighting that engineering this protease is a promising strategy to enhance HLB resistance in citrus. Together, our work reveals a pathogen-derived substrate of plant PLCPs and highlights bacterial OMPs as direct targets of plant defense.

Significance StatementHuanglongbing (HLB) is the most devastating disease of citrus with no resistance having been identified in commercial cultivars. Previous work implicated papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) as an important hub of defense in citrus; however, their precise role in HLB tolerance remained unclear. Here, we identify and characterize an outer membrane protein (OMP) from the HLB-associated bacterium as a substrate of the citrus PLCP RD21a. We demonstrate a specific cleavage of the bacterial OMP by citrus RD21a, which may impair pathogen growth and/or activate plant immunity. Importantly, overexpression of RD21a enhances HLB tolerance in sweet oranges. This work identifies OMPs as substrates of plant PLCPs and provides insights into protease defense functions.","[{""name"":""USDA-NIFA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-70029-33197;2022-70029-38471;2023-70029-41280;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UKRI BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W00691X/1;BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""ERC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101019324;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32525008;U23A20198;""},{""name"":""Hatch"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FLA-CRC-005979;""},{""name"":""Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Florida Citrus Initiative Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Citrus Research and Development Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

We detected protein aggregates within the mitochondrial matrix, accompanied by a marked remodeling of cristae architecture. Concomitantly, the number of mitochondrial ribosome complexes was significantly reduced. Mitochondrial Hsp60 (mHsp60), a key protein folding machine, underwent major conformational changes to favor complexes with its co-chaperone mHsp10. We visualized the interactions of mHsp60 with native substrate proteins, and determined in vitro mHsp60 cryo- EM structures enabling nucleotide state assignment of the in situ structures. These data converge on a model of the mHsp60 functional cycle and its essential role in mitochondrial proteostasis.

Here, by coupling visualisation of global sub-Hz firing bursts to ER ultrastructural manipulations in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, alongside physical simulations, we establish a key ER structure-function principle: neuronal ER architecture dictates Ca2+ replenishment speed. Altering ER structure hinders network ER luminal connectivity and Ca2+ propagation from refill points at plasma membrane contact sites, impairing the ERs capability to supply repetitive Ca2+ bursts. The ER morpho-regulatory control of Ca2+ refill speed thus constitutes a switch on neuronal activity.

Displaced myonuclei are typically attributed to the activity of muscle stem cells, or satellite cells. We sought to address whether displaced myonuclei in adult skeletal muscle are exclusively from an exogenous source such as satellite cells or can result from resident myonuclear migration. To address this question, we used a murine recombination-independent muscle fibre-specific doxycycline-inducible fluorescent myonuclear labelling approach, EdU stem cell fate tracking, two durations of muscle mechanical overload (MOV, 3 days and 7 days), and fluorescent histology. Our findings show that: 1) displaced myonuclei emerge early during MOV, 2) resident myonuclear movement occurs rapidly during MOV, and 3) the contribution of resident versus exogenous displaced myonuclei depends on MOV duration, fibre type, and fibre size. These observations provide fundamental insights on myonuclear motility in response to stress in vivo and reframe our understanding of how a recognized feature of mammalian skeletal muscle can emerge in response to mechanical loading.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity.

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760652394773
