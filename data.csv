MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Avian influenza viruses enter cells after binding to glycan receptors with terminally linked a2-3 sialic acid, whereas human influenza viruses typically bind to glycan receptors terminally linked a2-6 sialic acid in the upper respiratory tract. Here, we evaluated the receptor binding properties of hemagglutinin (HA) trimers from a clade 2.3.4.4b avian isolate (A/American Wigeon/South Carolina/22-000345-001/2021) and a cattle isolate (A/dairy cattle/Texas/24-008749-002-v/2024).

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Unlike end-to-end text-to-sequence generation approaches, we employ a two-stage generative process. Initially, we generate structures based on given language instructions, followed by designing sequences conditioned on both the structure and the language. This approach facilitates searching within the smaller structure space rather than the vast sequence space. Experiments demonstrate that Pinal outperforms existing models, including the concurrent work ESM3, and can generalize to novel protein structures outside the training distribution when provided with appropriate instructions. This work aims to aid the biological community by advancing the design of novel proteins, and our code will be made publicly available soon.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Bacteria can evolve de novo resistance against T6SS attacks, but resistance is far from universal in natural communities, suggesting key features of T6SS weaponry may act to limit its evolution. Here, we combine eco-evolutionary modelling and experimental evolution to examine how toxin type and multiplicity in Acinetobacter baylyi attackers shape resistance evolution in susceptible Escherichia coli competitors. In both our models and experiments, we find that combinations of multiple distinct toxins limit resistance evolution by creating genetic bottlenecks, driving resistant lineages extinct before they can reach high frequency. We also show that, paradoxically, single-toxin attackers often drive the evolution of cross-resistance, protecting bacteria against unfamiliar toxin combinations, even though such evolutionary pathways were inaccessible against multi-toxin attackers. Our findings indicate that, comparable to antimicrobial and anticancer combination therapies, multi-toxin T6SS arsenals function to limit resistance evolution in competing microbes. This helps us to understand why T6SSs remain widespread and effective weapons in microbial communities, and why many bacteria T6SS-armed encode functionally diverse anti-competitor toxins.

SignificanceToxin secretion systems, such as T6SSs, are widely used by bacteria to inhibit competing microorganisms. Here, we show that the secretion of multiple toxins in combination can suppress the evolution of resistance to the T6SS, rationalising its continued widespread use across diverse communities. Our work shows that principles of combination therapy--well known in the context of antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer therapies--also apply in the context of microbial warfare, helping to explain why many bacteria maintain diverse T6SS toxin arsenals. Resistance suppression is also a technologically useful property of T6SS toxin cocktails, which could be harnessed as part of future biocontrol or biotherapeutic applications, using live T6SS-armed bacteria to limit the growth of problem microorganisms.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

To investigate the basis for species-specific developmental tempo we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of protein dynamics in mouse and human neural progenitors (NPs). Through a combination of targeted protein labelling, quantitative mass spectrometry, and functional genomics, we demonstrate that protein degradation is a key driver of tempo differences between mouse and human NPs. We observe a systematic 1.5-fold increase in protein half-lives in human NPs compared to mouse, independent of cellular compartment or protein function. This difference persists in post-mitotic neurons, indicating active degradation as the primary mechanism. Proteasomal activity is also ~1.5-fold higher in mouse NPs, consistent with upregulation of proteasome-associated proteins. Importantly, increasing the rate of proteolytic degradation of a key transcriptional repressor in neural progenitors accelerates the expression of its target gene. Despite differences in degradation rates, protein synthesis rates are similar between species, resulting in higher protein content in human NPs. Our findings highlight the central role of protein degradation in controlling developmental tempo and provide insight into the molecular basis of evolutionary changes in developmental timing across species.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

TDP-43 is an intrinsically disordered multidomain protein that consists of an N-terminal domain (NTD1-102), two tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRM1102-177 and RRM2191-260), and an intrinsically disordered glycine-rich C-terminal261-414 domain. We previously identified a chemical probe which led to allosteric alterations between the RRM and NTD of TDP-43. We attributed these changes to potential interdomain interactions between the NTD and RRM segments. In this work, we compared the 2D [1H,15N] HSQC-NMR resonances of two constructs, TDP-43102-260 (RRM domain alone) against TDP-431-260 (NTD linked to RRM) and observed clustered shifts in the RNA binding sites of both RRM domains. To investigate why these shifts appeared in the RRM domains, in the absence of RNA, we hypothesized that the NTD domain could be stacking on the RRM domains. Thus, we modeled NTD-RRM interactions using protein-protein docking along with de novo sequence-to-structure predictions of TDP-431-260 that propose NTD stacking onto the RRM domains. Using Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)-relaxation dispersion NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrated evidence of an interaction between NTD1-102 and RRMs102-260. Finally, we investigated the impact of NTD on RNA binding using 2D 15N-HSQC-NMR and microscale thermophoresis (MST) by titration of a short UG-rich RNA sequence and observed significant changes in RNA binding between TDP-43102-260 and TDP-431-260, further suggesting the NTD plays a role in TDP-43 RNA interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Mapping the genetic architecture and discovering variants with pleiotropic effects across metabolites can reveal underlying mechanisms and potential targets for personalized interventions.

MethodsWe performed univariate and multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the Nightingale panel of 249 circulating plasma metabolic markers, across 207,836 White British UK Biobank participants (mean age 57.4 years, 53.7% female), with replication conducted across 27,509 UK Biobank participants with different ancestries, and 92,661 Estonian Biobank participants (mean age 50.9 years, 65.7% female). We investigated rare variation through whole exome sequencing gene burden tests, quantified genetic architectures through Gaussian mixture modelling, analysed the causal role of body mass index (BMI) through Mendelian randomization, and performed genome-wide interaction analyses with sex.

ResultsWe discovered 14,837 loci (497 unique), with shared and distinct effects on cardiometabolic traits, with high replication rates across populations. The loci explained over 70% of genetic variance for fatty acids. Findings from common and rare variant gene tests converged on lipid homeostasis pathways. There was strong evidence for causal effects of BMI on cholesterol and amino acid levels. We discovered 31 loci interacting with sex, which mapped to genes involved in cholesterol processing, and to cardiometabolic conditions with sex differences in prevalence.

DiscussionThe findings offer new insights into the genetic architecture of circulating metabolites, revealing novel loci and plausible sex-specific molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism. This improved understanding of the molecular biology of metabolism lays a foundation for personalized prevention and treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Beyond well-studied plants and cyanobacteria, many bacteria use Rubisco for chemolithoautotrophy in extreme environments on Earth. Here, we characterized the diversity of chemolithoautotrophic Rubiscos in subzero environments. First, we surveyed subzero environments and found that the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was the most prevalent chemolithoautotrophic pathway. Second, we uncovered potential for chemolithoautotrophy in metagenomes from two distinct subzero, hypersaline Arctic environments: 40-kyr relic marine brines encased within permafrost (cryopeg brines) and first-year sea ice. Again, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle was the dominant chemolithoautotrophic pathway in both environments, though with different Rubisco forms. From cryopeg brine, we reconstructed four metagenome-assembled genomes with the potential for chemolithoautotrophy, of which the sulfur-oxidizing genus Thiomicrorhabdus was most abundant. A broader survey of Thiomicrorhabdus genomes from diverse environments identified a core complement of three Rubisco forms (II, IAc, IAq) with distinct patterns of gain and loss. We developed a model framework and compared these different Rubisco forms across [CO2], [O2], and temperature. We found that form II outcompetes form I at low O2, but cold temperatures minimize this advantage. However, further inspection of form II from cold environments uncovered signals of thermal adaptation of key amino acids which resulted in a more exposed active site. These modifications suggest that these form II Rubisco proteins may have unique kinetics or thermal stability. This work can help address the limits of autotrophic functionality in extreme environments on Earth and other planetary bodies.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Here, we explore urea utilization from 50 to 4000 meters depth in the northeastern Pacific Ocean using metagenomics, nitrification rates, and single-cell stable-isotope-uptake measurements with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). We find that the majority (>60%) of active cells across all samples assimilated urea-derived N, and that cell-specific nitrogen-incorporation rates from urea were higher than that from ammonium. Both urea concentrations and assimilation rates relative to ammonium generally increased below the euphotic zone. We detected ammonia- and urea-based nitrification at all depths at one of two sites analyzed, demonstrating their potential to support chemoautotrophy in the mesopelagic and bathypelagic regions. Using newly generated metagenomes we find that the ureC gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of urease, is found within 39% of deep-sea cells in this region, including the Nitrosophaerota (likely for nitrification) as well as thirteen other phyla such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Plantomycetota, Nitrospinota, and Chloroflexota (likely for assimilation). Analysis of public metagenomes revealed ureC within 10-46% of deep-sea cells around the world, with higher prevalance below the photic zone, suggesting urea is widely available to the deep-sea microbiome globally. Our results demonstrate that urea is a nitrogen source to abundant and diverse microorganisms in the dark ocean, as well as a significant contributor to deep-sea nitrification and therefore fuel for chemoautotrophy.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

While regeneration-specific genes conserved in highly regenerative organisms may confer regenerative abilities and long-term maintenance of tissue homeostasis, it remains unclear whether introducing these regenerative genes into low regenerative animals can improve their regeneration and aging processes.

ResultsHere we ectopically express high regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs) in Drosophila, a widely used low regenerative model organism. Surprisingly, HRJD expression impedes tissue regeneration in the developing wing disc but extends organismal lifespan when expressed in the intestinal stem cell lineages of the adult midgut under non-regenerative conditions. Notably, HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions.

ConclusionsThese findings together suggest that the introduction of highly regenerative species-specific genes can improve stem cell functions and promote a healthy lifespan when expressed in aging animals.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

I rely on the eye color records of over 30,000 Italians--a single-ethnicity population that features the largest genetic and eye-color diversity in Europe. First, more men than women express eye colors at the two extremes of the melanin range (blue and dark-brown) and more women than men express colors in the middle (green, hazel, brown, and mixed). Second, dark-brown-eyed mothers produce more sons with dark-brown eyes and fewer with very-light-brown ones than do dark-brown-eyed fathers. Symmetrically, dark-brown-eyed fathers produce more daughters with dark-brown eyes and fewer with very-light-brown ones than do dark-brown-eyed mothers. All of this suggests that human eye pigmentation is controlled by a gene sitting on chromosome X--a chromosome which fathers pass on only to daughters, and sons inherit only from mothers. Such knowledge can improve forensic tools ability to predict eye color from DNA found at crime scenes and help in the identification of a known individuals unknown birth parents. On a grander scale, these findings cast a new light on the origin of other, more fateful sex differences.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive with conventional neuroimaging. Recent advances in MRI hardware and new biophysical models of tissue informed by diffusion MRI data hold promise for identifying the cellular changes driving these morphological observations. This study used ultra-strong gradient MRI to obtain high-resolution, in vivo estimates of cortical neurite and soma microstructure in sample of typically developing children and adolescents. Cortical neurite signal fraction, attributed to neuronal and glial processes, increased with age (mean R2fneurite=.53, p<3.3e-11, 11.91% increase over age), while apparent soma radius decreased (mean R2Rsoma=.48, p<4.4e-10, 1% decrease over age) across domain-specific networks. To complement these findings, developmental patterns of cortical gene expression in two independent post-mortem databases were analysed. This revealed increased expression of genes expressed in oligodendrocytes, and excitatory neurons, alongside a relative decrease in expression of genes expressed in astrocyte, microglia and endothelial cell-types. Age-related genes were significantly enriched in cortical oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors and Layer 5-6 neurons (pFDR<.001) and prominently expressed in adolescence and young adulthood. The spatial and temporal alignment of oligodendrocyte cell-type gene expression with neurite and soma microstructural changes suggest that ongoing cortical myelination processes contribute to adolescent cortical development. These findings highlight the role of intra-cortical myelination in cortical maturation during adolescence and into adulthood.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

This small field of view may not represent the behaviour across the entire sample and the manual selection of which restricted ROI to use may introduce bias. Currently, this is often circumvented by stitching and tiling methods which stitch many small ROI together, however this can result in artefacts across an image which poses an issue when analysing data. To combat this, we have used the Mesolens alongside Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations analysis, to obtain super-resolved images over a field of view of 4.4 mm x 3.0 mm with minimal error.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

The effects of stop-loss mutations can have multiple consequences that are, however, hard to predict. Stop-loss in ITM2B/BRI2 results in C-terminal extension of the encoded protein and, upon furin cleavage, in the production of two 34 amino acid long peptides, ADan and ABri, that accumulate as amyloids in the brains of patients affected by familial Danish and British Dementia. To systematically explore the consequences of Bri2 C-terminal extension, here, we measure amyloid formation for 676 ADan substitutions and identify the region that forms the putative amyloid core of ADan fibrils, located between positions 20 and 26, where stop-loss occurs. Moreover, we measure amyloid formation for ~18,000 random C-terminal extensions of Bri2 and find that ~32% of these sequences can nucleate amyloids. We find that the amino acid composition of these nucleating sequences varies with peptide length and that short extensions of 2 specific amino acids (Aliphatics, Aromatics and Cysteines) are sufficient to generate novel amyloid cores. Overall, our results show that the C-terminus of Bri2 contains an incomplete amyloid motif that can turn amyloidogenic upon extension. C-terminal extension with de novo formation of amyloid motifs may thus be a widespread pathogenic mechanism resulting from stop-loss, highlighting the importance of determining the impact of these mutations for other sequences across the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Using this tool in mice, we tested whether NE is released into the dorsal hippocampus during event boundaries defined by unexpected transitions between spatial contexts and presentations of novel objections. We found that NE binding dynamics were well explained by the time elapsed after each of these environmental changes, and were not related to conditioned behaviors, exploratory bouts of movement, or reward. Familiarity with a spatial context accelerated the rate in which phasic NE binding decayed to baseline. Knowing when NE is elevated, we tested how hippocampal coding of space differs during these moments. Immediately after context transitions we observed relatively unique patterns of neural spiking which settled into a modal state at a similar rate in which NE returned to baseline. These results are consistent with a model wherein NE release drives hippocampal representations away from a steady-state attractor. We hypothesize that the distinctive neural codes observed after each event boundary may facilitate long-term memory and contribute to the neural basis for the primacy effect.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

However, there are few convincing modifiable factors for PCa and little is known about their potential interaction with genetic risk. We analyzed incident PCa cases (n=6,155) and controls (n=98,257) of European and African ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to evaluate the role of neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES)-and how it may interact with PRS-on PCa risk. Methods: We evaluated a multi-ancestry PCa PRS containing 269 genetic variants to understand the association of germline genetics with PCa in UKB. Using the English Indices of Deprivation, a set of validated metrics that quantify lack of resources within geographical areas, we performed logistic regression to investigate the main effects and interactions between nSES deprivation, PCa PRS, and PCa. Results: The PCa PRS was strongly associated with PCa (OR=2.04; 95%CI=2.00-2.09; P<0.001). Additionally, nSES deprivation indices were inversely associated with PCa: employment (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001), education (OR=0.94; 95%CI=0.83-0.98; P<0.001), health (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001), and income (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001). The PRS effects showed little heterogeneity across nSES deprivation indices, except for the Townsend Index (P=0.03) Conclusions: We reaffirmed genetics as a risk factor for PCa and identified nSES deprivation domains that influence PCa detection and are potentially correlated with environmental exposures that are a risk factor for PCa. These findings also suggest that nSES and genetic risk factors for PCa act independently.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Observational data has been primarily used to validate experimental results or to find patterns that inspire experiments - not for causal inference. As ecology tackles progressively larger problems, we are moving beyond the scales at which randomized controlled experiments are feasible. Using observational data for causal inference raises the problem of confounding variables, those affecting both a causal variable and response of interest. Unmeasured confounders lead to statistical bias, creating spurious correlations and masking true causal relationships. To combat this Omitted Variable Bias, other disciplines have developed rigorous approaches for causal inference from observational data addressing the problems of confounders. We show how Ecologists can harness some of these methods: identifying confounders via causal diagrams, using nested sampling designs, and statistical designs that address omitted variable bias for causal inference. Using a motivating example of warming effects on intertidal snails, we show how current methods in Ecology (e.g., mixed models) produce incorrect inferences, and how methods presented here outperform them, reducing bias and increasing statistical power. Our goal is to enable the widespread use of observational data as tool for causal inference for the next generation of Ecological studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human -synuclein (-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to -synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for -synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in -synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates -synuclein at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as underlying the selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ -syn- tg cells to reveal gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology, which included pSyn-dependent alterations in mitochondrial and endolysosomal genes. This study provides a comprehensive use case of IST, yielding new biological insights into the formation of -synuclein pathology and its downstream effects in a PD/DLB mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

To address this, myoblasts were differentiated into myotubes, and electrically paced (3 h/day, 4 days @ 14 V). CCA evoked an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in stimulated vs. non-stimulated (CON) myotubes as expected. EVs were isolated from conditioned media from control and stimulated myotubes using differential ultracentrifugation and characterized biophysically using tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS, Exoid), TEM and western blotting. TEM images confirmed isolated round-shaped vesicles of about 30 - 150 nm with an intact lipid bilayer. The mean size of EVs ranged from 98 -138 nm, and was not altered by CCA. Zeta potential and total EV protein yield remained unchanged between groups, and total EV secretion increased after 4 days of CCA. Concomitant analysis of EVs after each day of CCA also demonstrated a progressive increase in CCA-EV concentration, while size and zeta potential remained unaltered, and EV protein yield increased in both CON-EVs and CCA groups. CCA-EVs were enriched with small-EVs vs. CON-EVs, concomitant with higher expression of small-EV markers CD81, Tsg101 and HSP70. In whole cell lysates, CD63 and ApoA1 were reduced with CCA in myotubes, whereas CD81, Tsg101, Flotillin-1 and HSP70 levels remained unchanged. To evaluate the functional effect of EVs secreted post-CCA, we treated C2C12 myoblasts with all EVs isolated from CON or CCA myotubes after each day of stimulation, and measured cell count, cell viability, protein yield and mitochondrial biogenesis in recipient cells. There was no effect on cell count, viability and protein yield. Myoblasts treated with CCA-EVs exhibited increased mitochondrial biogenesis as indicated by enhanced MitoTracker Red staining, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and protein expression of electron transport chain subunit, CIV-MTCO1. Further, CCA-EV treatment enhanced maximal oxygen consumption rates (OCR), and ATP production in treated myoblasts. This increase in maximal OCR was abrogated when CCA-EVs pre-treated with proteinase K were co-cultured with myoblasts, indicating the pro-metabolic effect was likely mediated by transmembrane or peripheral membrane proteins in CCA-EVs. Our data highlight the novel effect of Skm-EVs isolated post-CCA in mediating pro-metabolic effects in recipient cells and thereby transmitting the effects associated with traditional exercise. Further investigation to interrogate the underlying mechanisms involved in downstream cellular metabolic adaptations is warranted.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Visual working memory (VWM) is an important brain function that allows us to maintain a mental representation of the world around us, but its capacity and precision peaks by around 20 years old and decreases steadily throughout the rest of our lives. This research examined the functional brain network dynamics associated with VWM throughout the lifespan and found that Default Mode Network and Fronto-Parietal Network states were more well represented in individuals with better VWM. Furthermore, transitions between the Visual/Somatomotor Network state and the Attention Network state were more well-represented in older adults, and a network control theory simulation demonstrated that structural connectivity differences supporting this transition were associated with better VWM, especially in middle-aged individuals. The structural connectivity of regions from all states was important for supporting this transition in younger adults, while regions within the Visual/Somatomotor and Attention Network states were more important in older adults. These findings demonstrate that structural connectivity supports flexible, functional dynamics that allow for better VWM with age and may lead to important interventions to uphold healthy VWM throughout the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

MethodsPTSD/MDD patients were randomized (N=51) to a two-condition sequence in a two period cross-over design. For the first condition, patients were randomized to 10-session rTMS treatment to either a subgenual cingulate (sgACC) functional connectivity cortical target (fMRI-guided) or standard scalp-based target. Additionally, patients were randomized to either watch a nature video or perform a demanding cognitive task with rTMS administration. Patients crossed over to the two conditions not received in period one. rTMS was delivered in an intermittent theta burst (iTBS) pattern with 2400 pulses per session. Among N=49 patients analyzed, 60% identified as female and average age was 34.

ResultsCompared with the scalp-based target, fMRI-guided rTMS was superior in improving depression symptoms (F(1,43.92)=5.933, p=0.019) as well as PTSD hyperarousal (F(1,40.78)=5.076, p=0.030).

The phagosome then fuses with endosomes and lysosomes to digest the particle. After particle degradation, phagosomes fragment to reform lysosomes and maintain phagocyte degradative capacity. As finite systems, phagocytes have a maximal phagocytic capacity, which should blunt further phagocytosis. However, the processes responsible for appetite exhaustion are not known. We found that macrophages at capacity retained Fc{gamma} receptors levels and did not shrink in size. Instead, surface membrane in-folding, membrane tension, and cortical F-actin were reduced in exhausted macrophages. Moreover, exhausted macrophages were depleted for both endosomes and lysosomes, and consequently, focal endosome exocytosis in remaining externally bound particles was blunted. In comparison, if phagosome resolution was permitted macrophages regained the phagocytic appetite. Altogether, we propose that depletion of the endomembrane pools is a major determinant of phagocytic fatigue as macrophages reach their phagocytic capacity, though other processes are also at play.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different C/T ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the C/T ratio and, remarkably, the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness aligns very closely to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to T, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1/T). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats response rates during the (never-reinforced) inter-trial interval, which was directly proportional to the contextual rate of reinforcement (1/C). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US. The consistency of the data across species, captured by a simple regression function, suggests a universal model of conditioning.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterisation of genes that act at the phage-host interface. To date, this is restricted to few model phage-host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes of both DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognised proteins that are essential for phage replication and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is a {Phi}KZ-encoded nuclease that acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. The non-genetic ASO-based gene silencing used here promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage-host pairs, and offers potential for optimising phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

However, the structural basis and mechanism of the ULK complex formation remain poorly understood. Here, we predicted the core interactions organizing the ULK complex using AlphaFold, which proposed that the intrinsically disordered region of ATG13 binds to the base of the two UBL domains in the FIP200 dimer using two phenylalanines and to the tandem MIT domain of ULK1, allowing for the 1:1:2 stoichiometry of the ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 complex. We confirmed the predicted interactions by point mutations and revealed the existence of direct triad interactions among ULK1, ATG13, and FIP200 in vitro and in cells, in which each interaction was additively important for autophagic flux. These results indicate that the ULK1-ATG13-FIP200 triadic interaction is crucial for autophagosome formation and provide a structural basis and insights into the regulation mechanism of autophagy initiation in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Previously, two cortical hedonic hotspots in orbitofrontal cortex and insula were identified by neurochemical stimulation using opioid or orexin microinjections. Here we used optogenetic stimulation in rats as an independent neurobiological technique for activating cortical hedonic hotspots to identify hedonic functions and map boundaries. We report that channelrhodopsin stimulations within rostral orbitofrontal and caudal insula hotspots doubled the number of hedonic liking reactions elicited by sucrose taste. This independently confirms their robust functional identity as causal amplifiers of hedonic liking and confirms their anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we confirmed an intervening suppressive hedonic coldstrip, to stretching from caudal orbitofrontal cortex to rostral insula. By contrast to localized hedonic hotspots for liking enhancement, motivational wanting for reward, measured as laser self-stimulation, was mediated by more widely distributed anatomical sites.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

The connection between dynamically adapting phenotypic states and the molecular programs that define them is not well understood. Here we develop data-driven models of single-cell phenotypic responses to extracellular stimuli by linking gene transcription levels to ""morphodynamics"" - changes in cell morphology and motility observable in time-lapse image data. We adopt a dynamics-first view of cell state by grouping single-cell trajectories into states with shared morphodynamic responses. The single-cell trajectories enable development of a first-of-its-kind computational approach to map live-cell dynamics to snapshot gene transcript levels, which we term MMIST, Molecular and Morphodynamics-Integrated Single-cell Trajectories. The key conceptual advance of MMIST is that cell behavior can be quantified based on dynamically defined states and that extracellular signals alter the overall distribution of cell states by altering rates of switching between states. We find a cell state landscape that is bound by epithelial and mesenchymal endpoints, with distinct sequences of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) intermediates. The analysis yields predictions for gene expression changes consistent with curated EMT gene sets and provides a prediction of thousands of RNA transcripts through extracellular signal-induced EMT and MET with near-continuous time resolution. The MMIST framework leverages true single-cell dynamical behavior to generate molecular-level omics inferences and is broadly applicable to other biological domains, time-lapse imaging approaches and molecular snapshot data.

SummaryEpithelial cells change behavior and state in response to signals, which is necessary for the function of healthy tissue, while aberrant responses can drive diseases like cancer. To decode and potentially steer these responses, there is a need to link live-cell behavior to molecular programs, but high-throughput molecular measurement is generally destructive or requires fixation. Here we present a novel method which connects single-cell morphology and motility over time to bulk molecular readouts. Our model predicts gene expression from the observation of label-free live-cell imaging, as a step toward understanding and ultimately controlling cell state change.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Unlike existing methods, BEAM uniquely accommodates an arbitrary number of omic profiles and endpoints. Results: In simulations, BEAM performed similarly to the theoretically best simple test and outperformed other integrated analysis methods. In an example pediatric leukemia application, BEAM identified several genes with biological relevance established by a CRISPR assay that had been missed by univariate screens and other integrated analysis methods.

This co-ordination is mediated by hormones or growth factors, molecules secreted by one cell type that can convey information to the other cells and influence their behaviour. Hormone-dependent signalling is mediated by second messenger systems;phosphoinositides (PIs) generated by lipid kinase activity are one such key second messenger system. Phosphatidylinositol 5 phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K) is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PI5P) to generate phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]. Following a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of ca. 23296 proteomes covering the tree of life, we find that PIP4K is a metazoan-specific enzyme, although its homologs are also found in choanoflagellate genomes. To understand their function in early metazoans, we experimentally analysed the biochemical activity and physiological function of PIP4K from several early metazoans. We find that the PIP4K enzyme from an early branching metazoan sponge Amphimedon queenslandica (AqPIP4K), regarded as the earliest evolved metazoan, shows a biochemical activity highly conserved with human PIP4K; AqPIP4K is able to selectively phosphorylate PI5P to generate PI(4,5)P2 just as effectively as the human enzyme. Further, AqPIP4K was able to rescue the reduced cell size, growth and development phenotype in larvae of a null mutant in Drosophila PIP4K. These phenotypes are regulated through activity of the hormone insulin, acting via the cell surface insulin receptor, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, that is unique to metazoans. Together, our findings indicate that in early metazoans, AqPIP4K is likely to function in a signal transduction pathway that is required for receptor tyrosine kinase signalling. Overall, our work defines PIP4K as a signal transduction motif required to regulate receptor tyrosine kinase signalling for intercellular communication in the earliest forms of metazoa.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

Here, large sulfoglyco-dendron HSPG-mimetics of different topologies, structures, and sizes were designed to this purpose. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were used to examine the ability of these broad-spectrum antivirals to block multi-protein HSPG-receptors in HIV, SARS-CoV-2, HPV, and dengue viruses. To characterize the inhibitory potential of these mimetics, their binding to individual and multiple protein receptors was examined. In particular, vectorial distributions of binding energies between the mimetics and viral protein receptors were introduced and calculated along the simulated trajectories. Space-dependent residual analysis of the mimetic-receptor binding was also performed. This analysis revealed detail nature of binding between these antivirals and viral protein receptors, and provided evidence that large inhibitors with multivalent binding might act like a molecular glue initiating the self-assembly of protein receptors in enveloped viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

However, the neurophysiological basis of these cognitive enhancements has remained relatively unclear. Previous studies have widely examined EEG during mindfulness practice - or made comparisons with long-term meditators and controls - but have failed to capture how EEG dynamics in subsequent cognitive testing scenarios might be altered as a function of mindfulness-based interventions. The current study therefore aimed to assess a variety of EEG dynamics (oscillatory, aperiodic, and event-related) during engagement in a dynamic and complex cognitive task, following a mindfulness-based cognitive training regime. Participants (n = 40, age range = 18 - 38) attended the lab on two separate occasions (pre- and post- a web-based one-week mindfulness intervention), where EEG was recorded during engagement in the Target Motion Analyst (TMA) task. Previous analysis of the same participants demonstrated that greater adherence to the mindfulness-based cognitive training was associated with improved performance on the TMA task (Dziego, Bornkessel-Schlesewsky, Schlesewsky et al., 2024). Here, we capitalise on these previous findings to assess whether adherence is paralleled by measurable differences in on-task EEG dynamics. Linear mixed-effects modelling demonstrated that, while main effects were observed across session, adherence to cognitive training was not directly associated with alpha power, theta power or 1/f parameters. Challenges also arose when computing event-related potentials (ERPs), illustrating the difficulties of using this technique in more complex testing environments. While these results are challenging to place within the context of previous EEG studies on meditation and cognitive performance, our findings highlight the complexities in understanding the cognitive benefits of mindfulness-based training interventions through EEG dynamics observed during subsequent cognitive testing.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

While this framework is well-suited for hypothesis testing approaches, achieving the modern goal of precision medicine requires a different framework that is predictive in nature and that focuses on maximizing the predictive power of models and evaluating their ability to generalize beyond the data that were used to train them. However, few tools exist to support the development and evaluation of predictive models in the context of neuroimaging or lesion-behavior research, creating an obstacle to the widespread adoption of predictive modeling approaches in the field. Further, existing tools for lesion-behavior analysis are often unable to accommodate categorical outcome variables and often impose restrictions on the predictor data. Researchers therefore often must use different software packages and analytical approaches depending on whether they are addressing a classification vs. regression problem and on whether their predictor data correspond to binary lesion images, continuous lesion-network images, connectivity matrices, or other data modalities. To address these limitations, we have developed a MATLAB software toolkit that supports both inferential and predictive modeling frameworks, accommodates both classification and regression problems, and does not impose restrictions on the modality of the predictor data. The toolkit features both a graphical user interface and scripting interface, includes implementations of multiple mass-univariate, multivariate, and machine learning models, features built-in and customizable routines for hyper-parameter optimization, cross-validation, model stacking, and significance testing, and automatically generates text-based descriptions of key methodological details and modeling results to improve reproducibility and minimize errors in the reporting of methods and results. Here, we provide an overview and discussion of the toolkit features and demonstrate its functionality by applying it to the question of how expressive and receptive language impairments relate to lesion location, structural disconnection, and functional network disruption in a large sample of patients with left hemispheric brain lesions. We find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are most strongly associated with left lateral prefrontal and left posterior temporal/parietal damage, respectively. We also find that impairments in expressive vs. receptive language are associated with partially overlapping patterns of fronto-temporal structural disconnection, and that the associated functional networks are also similar. Importantly, we find that lesion location and lesion-derived network measures are highly predictive of both types of impairment, with predictions from models trained on these measures explaining ~30-40% of the variance on average when applied to data from patients not used to train the models. We have made the toolkit publicly available, and we have included a comprehensive set of tutorial notebooks to support new users in applying the toolkit in their studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

If a pathogen is usually absent from a host population, a key public health policy question is whether the pathogens arrival will initiate local transmission, which depends on the season in which arrival occurs. This question can be addressed by estimating the ""probability of a major outbreak"" (the probability that introduced cases will initiate sustained local transmission). A standard approach for inferring this probability exists for seasonal pathogens (involving calculating the Case Epidemic Risk; CER) based on the mathematical theory of branching processes. Under that theory, the probability of pathogen extinction is estimated, neglecting depletion of susceptible individuals. The CER is then one minus the extinction probability. However, as we show, if transmission cannot occur for long periods of the year (e.g., over winter or over summer), the pathogen will inevitably go extinct, leading to a CER of zero even if seasonal outbreaks can occur. This renders the CER uninformative in those scenarios. We therefore devise an alternative approach for inferring outbreak risks for seasonal pathogens (involving calculating the Threshold Epidemic Risk; TER). Estimation of the TER involves calculating the probability that introduced cases will initiate a local outbreak in which a threshold number of infections is exceeded before outbreak extinction. For simple seasonal epidemic models, such as the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model, the TER can be calculated numerically (without model simulations). For more complex models, such as stochastic host-vector models, the TER can be estimated using model simulations. We demonstrate the application of our approach by considering Chikungunya virus in northern Italy as a case study. In that context, transmission is most likely in summer, when environmental conditions promote vector abundance. We show that the TER provides more useful assessments of outbreak risks than the CER, enabling practically relevant risk quantification for seasonal pathogens.

Author SummaryInvasive pathogens pose a challenge to human health, particularly as outbreak risks for some infectious diseases are being exacerbated by climate change. For example, the occurrence of seasonal vector-borne disease outbreaks in mainland Europe is increasing, even though pathogens like the Chikungunya and dengue viruses are not normally present there. In this changing landscape, assessing the risk posed by invasive pathogens requires computational methods for estimating the probability that introduced cases will lead to a local outbreak, as opposed to the first few cases fading out without causing a local outbreak. In this article, we therefore provide a computational framework for estimating the risk that introduced cases will lead to a local outbreak in which a pre-specified, context specific threshold number of cases is exceeded (we term this risk the ""Threshold Epidemic Risk"", or TER). Since even small seasonal outbreaks can have negative impacts on local populations, we demonstrate that calculation of the TER provides more appropriate estimates of local outbreak risks than those inferred using standard methods. Going forwards, our computational modelling framework can be used to assess outbreak risks for a wide range of seasonal diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Here, we examined the receptor specificity of a bovine HPAI H5N1 virus (A/bovine/OH/B24OSU-432/2024, H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b) employing four different assays including glycan array technology, bio-layer interferometry (BLI), a solid phase capture assay and hemagglutination of glycan remodeled erythrocytes. As controls, well characterized avian (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, H5N1, clade 1) and human (A/CA/04/2009, H1N1) IAVs were included that bind alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-sialosides, respectively. We found that A/bovine/OH/B24OSU-432/2024 preferentially binds to avian type receptors (alpha2,3-sialosides). Furthermore, sequence alignments showed that A/bovine has maintained amino acids in its HA associated with alpha2,3-sialoside (avian) receptor specificity. We conclude that while we find no evidence that A/bovine has acquired human virus receptor binding specificity, ongoing efforts must be placed on monitoring for this trait.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

We identified risk genes expressed in brain organizers and sequential gene regulatory networks across corticogenesis revealing disease-specific critical phases, when NSCs are more vulnerable to gene dysfunctions, and converging signaling across multiple diseases. Moreover, we simulated the impact of risk transcription factor (TF) depletions on different neural cell types spanning the developing human neocortex and observed a spatiotemporal-dependent effect for each perturbation.

Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) has emerged as a powerful tool to elucidate the evolutionary history of protein families and identify sequence determinants of protein function. Here, we present AncFlow, an automated software pipeline that integrates phylogenetic analysis, subfamily identification, and ASR to generate ancestral protein sequences for structural prediction using state-of-the-art tools like AlphaFold. AncFlow streamlines the process of ASR by combining multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree inference, subfamily identification, and ancestral sequence reconstruction from unaligned protein sequences. The reconstructed ancestral sequences are then subjected to structural prediction using AlphaFold, enabling the investigation of the structural basis of functional divergence within protein families. We validated AncFlow using two well-characterized protein families: acyltransferases and dehydrogenases. The pipeline successfully reconstructed ancestral sequences for multiple internal nodes of the phylogenetic trees, and their predicted structures were compared with those of extant proteins. By analyzing the structural similarities and differences between ancestral and extant proteins, we gained insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the functional diversification within these families. AncFlow demonstrates the potential of integrating ASR and structural prediction to unravel the structural basis of functional divergence in protein families. The insights gained from this approach can guide protein engineering efforts, facilitating the design of proteins with desired functions. As the amount of sequence data continues to grow, AncFlow provides a valuable tool for exploring the evolutionary landscape of proteins and accelerating the discovery of novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

At templated AP-sites, HMCES DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) regulate replication fork speed while avoiding APE1-mediated cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSB). Whereas the role of HMCES at template DNA strand is well studied, its consequences on nascent DNA are less understood. Here, we provide evidence that HMCES play detrimental roles during removal of 5- hydroxymethyl-2-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)-derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxyuridine (5hmdU) by BER at replication forks. HRD cells display heightened HMCES chromatin levels, which increase upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP-sites. HMCES depletion largely suppresses 5hmdC- mediated Fancd2-/- replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations and cell lethality, suggesting that HMCES is responsible for the replication fork impairment and lethality observed in HRD cells. Therefore, HMCES-DPCs are a novel source of BER-initiated PRIMPOL-mediated ssDNA gaps, implying endogenous DPCs as a source of DNA damage in HRD tumours.

Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

We examined the effect of combining antibiotics on within-patient resistance development across various bacterial pathogens and antibiotics.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm. Trials powered to detect differences in resistance development or well-designed observational studies are required to clarify the impact of combination therapy on resistance.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722722697217

This review examines trends in SCD among pilots from a global perspective, analyzing evidence from 2011 to 2023, with a focus on its growing impact as a global crisis and recent findings pointing to a potential rise in incidence, particularly after 2019.

ObjectivesTo analyze the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention strategies for SCD in pilots, particularly post-COVID-19.

MethodsThe PRISMA guidelines for systematic meta-analysis was used, a search of peer-reviewed literature for international aviation databases, and pilot associations was conducted to identify relevant data. The analysis focused on trends in SCD prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and recent findings, including the potential impact of COVID-19, the role of vaccination, and important biomarkers to screen for predisposition. Eligibility criteria included studies reporting SCD incidence, risk factors, or prevention strategies in pilots. Data were extracted, and meta-analyses conducted.

ResultsRecent studies suggest a potential increase in SCD incidence among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular complications, increased stress, disruptions in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle may contribute to this potential rise. Identified risk factors include age, male gender, and cardiovascular comorbidities.

Biomarkers such as troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been identified as potential indicators of increased SCD risk in pilots. Preventive measures include regular cardiovascular assessments and lifestyle modifications.

ConclusionSCD remains a significant and rising threat to pilots, posing a global crisis that requires immediate attention. Through a comprehensive approach that includes risk assessment, preventive measures, emergency response, and preventive protocols, the aviation industry can mitigate this risk and safeguard the lives of pilots and passengers.

This review also suggests standardized examination protocol for pilots includes regular cardiovascular risk assessment, biomarker screening, monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination status, lifestyle modifications, and a standardized reporting system. The adoption of a standardized protocol by aviation regulatory bodies and airlines worldwide is crucial to address the growing threat of SCD among pilots and ensure the highest standards of aviation safety.","NA","medrxiv",1722722697217

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria.
