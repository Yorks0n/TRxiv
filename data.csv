The composition of epithelial cells in human pulmonary fibrosis - irrespective of disease etiology - is marked by the presence of Aberrant Basaloid cells: an abnormal cell phenotype with pro-fibrotic and senescent features, localized to the surface of fibrotic lesions. Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells ex vivo and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention. This study elucidates the phenomenon of maladaptive epithelial plasticity and regeneration in pulmonary fibrosis and re-contextualizes therapeutic strategies for epithelial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811838

Yet, they take over a year to complete, are prone to human error, and face challenges with reproducibility; limiting access to timely and reliable information. We developed otto-SR, an end-to-end agentic workflow using large language models (LLMs) to support and automate the SR workflow from initial search to analysis. We found that otto-SR outperformed traditional dual human workflows in SR screening (otto-SR: 96.7% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity; human: 81.7% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity) and data extraction (otto-SR: 93.1% accuracy; human: 79.7% accuracy). Using otto-SR, we reproduced and updated an entire issue of Cochrane reviews (n=12) in two days, representing approximately 12 work-years of traditional systematic review work. Across Cochrane reviews, otto-SR incorrectly excluded a median of 0 studies (IQR 0 to 0.25), and found a median of 2.0 (IQR 1 to 6.5) eligible studies likely missed by the original authors. Meta-analyses revealed that otto-SR generated newly statistically significant conclusions in 2 reviews and negated significance in 1 review. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously conduct and update systematic reviews with superhuman performance, laying the foundation for automated, scalable, and reliable evidence synthesis.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811838

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811838

Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule. These results show a novel interplay between plasmid and surface architecture across diverse species that controls the conjugation transcriptional landscape, with important ramifications for plasmid dissemination and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811838

We used the resulting caffeine-inducible domains in engineered cytokine receptors for caffeine-inducible STAT3 signaling and in split transcription factors (caff-TFs) containing human-derived zinc-finger proteins. Heterodimerization of split transcription factors drastically enhanced their performance compared to homodimerization. We demonstrate that caff-TFs are compatible with lentiviral and retroviral delivery to Jurkat T-cells and enable inducible expression of therapeutic genes such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in response to caffeine concentrations consistent with normal coffee consumption. By using the common, non-toxic molecule caffeine, and exclusively humanized protein components, these systems promise to be a safer alternative to existing systems and may be used in synthetic biology applications and for safer, more effective cell therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

However, current tools employing variational inference on single-cell datasets, including methods for paired and mosaic integration, transfer learning, and modality imputation, typically act as black boxes. This lack of interpretability makes it challenging to evaluate whether biological variation is preserved, which can compromise downstream analyses. Here, we introduce NetworkVI, a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data. NetworkVI utilizes biological prior knowledge as an inductive bias, specifically it relies on gene-gene interactions inferred from topologically associated domains and structured ontologies like the Gene Ontology to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and subcellular level. While achieving state-of-the-art data integration, modality imputation, and cell label transfer via query-to-reference mapping benchmarks across bimodal and trimodal datasets, NetworkVI additionally excels in providing biologically meaningful modality- and cell type-specific interpretations. NetworkVI aids researchers in identifying associations between genes and biological processes and uncovers immune evasion mechanisms in a Perturb CITE-seq dataset of melanoma cells. NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.

In modern landscape models, attractors represent cell types, and stochastic jumps and bifurcations drive cellular decisions, allowing for quantitative and predictive descriptions. However, given a biological problem of interest, we still lack tools to infer and build possible Waddington landscapes systematically. In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode  valleys of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations. Conversely, topographic features appear strongly constrained by dynamical data, which suggests that our approach can generically derive interpretable and predictive epigenetic landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties.

Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth.

The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics. This approach will help to bridge the gap between connectomics, which emphasizes brain networks, and translational neuroscience, which often focuses on the unique roles of brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Improving pDNA production in the most common production host (E. coli) has faced obstacles arising from the complex network of genes responsible for pDNA synthesis, with the specific enzyme(s) limiting pDNA yield remaining unidentified. To address this challenge, we employed an inducible genome-wide mutagenesis strategy, combined with fluorescent screening, to isolate E. coli NEB 5 strains with enhanced pDNA production. Following selection, we successfully isolated an E. coli strain (M3) with elevated plasmid copy numbers (PCNs) across multiple origin types. Specifically, we observed a 5.93-fold increase in PCN for the GFP reporter plasmid, a 1.93-fold increase for the gWiz DNA vaccine plasmid, and an 8.7-fold increase for the pAAV-CAGG-eGFP plasmid, all of which contain pUC origins. In addition, plasmids with p15A and pSC101 origins showed 1.44-fold and 1.68-fold increases in PCN, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted strain M3 identified 85 mutations, including one in recG, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Replacement of the mutant recG with its wild-type counterpart in the mutant strain resulted in a 63% reduction in PCN, but the recG mutation alone was insufficient to increase PCN in the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the recG mutation plays a synergistic role with other genomic mutations to drive PCN increases. Taken together, this study presents the development of a pDNA hyperaccumulating E. coli strain with promising applications in industrial and therapeutic pDNA production, while also offering important insights into key genes involved in pDNA production.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Here we investigate the critical functions of chromatin regulator MORC2 in epigenome reprogramming of the repetitive genome in early human neurodevelopment. We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Mutation of the MORC2 ATPase module, causative for neurodevelopmental disorders, severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells. Upon neural differentiation these phenotypes persist due to striking, targeted defects in CpG methylation patterning. Together our results define the vital role of MORC2 in safeguarding the somatic human genome upon exit of pluripotency by directing CpG methylation patterning over transcriptionally-active retrotransposons in a manner analogous to the piRNA pathway in the germline.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Using Siglec-liposomes, we profiled Siglec ligands on human leukocytes, revealing new insights into Siglec ligands. Moreover, Siglec-liposomes are in vivo compatible, where we demonstrated that Siglec-7-liposomes bind to the brain vasculature in a mucin-dependent manner. Given the abundance of Siglec ligands on T cells, we investigated whether Siglec-liposomes modulate T cell function and find that Siglec-7-liposomes increase T cell proliferation in a ST3Gal1-dependent and CD43-independent manner. Taken together, Siglec-liposomes are a versatile and sensitive tool for detecting Siglec ligands and immunomodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Dissecting the contributions of populations of neurons to these functions requires knowledge of interactions between brain areas. We investigated these interactions using dual hemisphere recordings of prefrontal cortex in monkeys performing a spatial memory task. To tease apart global processing from local interactions, we applied a novel statistical approach called pCCA-FA (a combination of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis and factor analysis) to analyze trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses. We found substantial shared variability among neurons within each population, much of which was actually shared across populations and linked to an arousal process. Our work presents a path by which we can leverage multi-area recordings to reveal aspects of brain functions that are hidden in single-area recordings.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

Key MessagesA Key Messages section should be added after the keywords and before the articles introduction, with the key messages of the paper made in 3 bullet points that succinctly describe:

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

Here, we demonstrate this technique using the MS2 VLP as a model self-assembling, proteinaceous nanoparticle. We constructed, for the first time, a comprehensive circular permutation library of the fused MS2 coat protein dimer construct. The strategy revealed new terminal locations, validated via cryo-electron microscopy, that enabled C-terminal peptide tagging and led to a stable protein encapsulation strategy via covalent bonding - a feature the native coat protein does not permit.

As a result, TD can discriminate between essential and non-essential genes with the competitive performances of one of SOTA, JACKS, which previously outperformed various SOTA. In addition to this, in spite of that TD is nothing but the simple linear algebra, TD can achieve the performance even without control samples without which JACKS even cannot be performed. Moreover, since raw and logarithmic values can achieve the similar performances through TD for the largest dataset among those tested, taking logarithmic values as has been done frequently is questioned. In conclusion, TD is the ever first method that can integrate multiple sgRNAs and profiles simultaneously and can achieve comparative performances with JACKS, one of SOTA.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

To address this challenge, we developed ARTIC HELP (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation), a practical, open-source adaptation of the widely adopted ARTIC nanopore sequencing protocol for viral genomic surveillance. We describe generic, cost-effective alternatives to all enzyme mixes used in tiling multiplex RT-PCR amplification of the virus genome, and the nanopore native barcoding workflow, including end-prep (EP), barcode ligation (BL), and adapter ligation (AL), making it broadly applicable to any laboratory. Through systematic evaluation, we identified a wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase and two types of proofreading DNA polymerases as effective alternatives when standard reagents are unavailable due to high cost or limited supply: B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a fused Sso7d DNA-binding domain, and blends combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) polymerases. Validation on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII confirmed that the HELP workflow achieves genome coverage comparable to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. For SARS-CoV-2 samples (Ct [&le;]28), the wild-type M-MLV RT combined with selected Pfu or A+B polymerases, along with optimised HELP mixes (EP, BL, AL), achieved genome coverage of 84.0-99.6%. For Norovirus GII (Ct [&le;]32), the HELP workflow using one of the Pfu polymerases achieved genome coverage of >85% for six out of eight genotypes tested. Notably, several of the other polymerases tested showed reduced performance at higher Ct values. However, they still achieved strong coverage at Ct <24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives in rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. Our approach, ARTIC HELP, provides a framework which can be implemented to address supply chain disruptions, while maintaining robust genomic sequencing capabilities. A cost analysis highlights the well-known significant global disparities in reagent pricing, driven not by protocol differences but by import fees and supply barriers. Thus, our findings highlight the need for fairer global pricing models and support for local sourcing strategies like HELP, to promote equity in genomic research and ensure preparedness for future public health challenges.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Traditionally, mtDNA deletions have been studied using bulk DNA sequencing, but bulk methods average signals across cells, thereby masking the cell-type-specific mutational landscapes. Resolving mtDNA deletions at single-cell resolution is beneficial for understanding how these mutations affect distinct cell populations. To date, no specialized method exists for detecting cell-type-specific mtDNA deletions from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Notably, mtDNA possesses unique molecular features: a high copy number, stable transcription, and compact structure of the mitochondrial genome. This results in a relatively high abundance of mtDNA-derived reads even in single-cell RNA sequencing data, suggesting the possibility of detecting mtDNA deletion variants directly from transcriptomic data.

ResultsHere, we present MitoDelta, a computational pipeline that enables the detection of mtDNA deletions at cell-type resolution solely from single-cell RNA sequencing data. MitoDelta combines a sensitive alignment strategy with robust statistical filtering based on a beta-binomial model, allowing accurate identification of deletion events even from noisy single-cell transcriptomes. To capture cell-type-specific deletion patterns, MitoDelta analyzes reads pooled by annotated cell types, enabling quantification of deletion burden across distinct cellular populations. We benchmarked MitoDelta against existing mtDNA deletion detection tools and demonstrated superior overall performance. As a practical application, we applied MitoDelta to a published single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset for Parkinsons disease and revealed distinct mtDNA deletion burdens across neuronal subtypes.

ConclusionsMitoDelta enables the transcriptome-integrated, cell-type-specific detection of mtDNA deletions from single-cell RNA sequencing data alone, offering a valuable framework for reanalyzing public datasets and studying mitochondrial genome alterations at cell-type resolution. This integrated approach enables insights into how mtDNA deletions are distributed across specific cell types and cellular states, providing new opportunities to investigate the role of mtDNA deletions in cell-type-specific disease mechanisms.

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations.
C_LIO_LINBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is one such biomarker, which is used to help guide immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment through the classification of samples as either having high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or as being microsatellite stable (MSS). One area that has yet to be addressed in depth is whether MSI itself is a heterogeneous phenomenon, such that only some subclones are MSI-H. To investigate heterogeneity in MSI status, we curated and analyzed data from several single-cell RNA sequencing studies that had paired clinical MSI status and developed a computational pipeline to infer MSI-H cells and quantify heterogeneity In MSI status. We found evidence of heterogeneity in MSI status both in individuals originally classified as MSI-H and MSS. Out of 49 individuals, 15 showed evidence of divergence in MSI status between distinct clusters of cancer cells and most had distinct MSI-H and MSS subclones. These results raise questions about the current practice of treating MSI as a binary biomarker, ignoring heterogeneity between cancer subclones. Accounting for heterogeneity may lead to improved biomarker performance and, potentially, help explain reports of intrinsic treatment resistance and low overall responder rate in MSI-H cancers. Further studies are warranted to determine the frequency of heterogeneity in this biomarker at the population level, and whether the presence of both MSI-H and MSS subclones can have clinical implications.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

From February to December 2021, we carried out one of the highest-intensity SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance programmes in Europe and implemented genomics-enhanced contact tracing for the characterization of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. Here, we report on the first retrospective analysis of the complete dataset, integrating data 32,380 cases, 49,906 forward and backward contact tracing records, 162 recorded institutional outbreaks, and 8,028 viral genome sequences (case sequencing coverage 24.5%). 84% of putative transmission detected by forward contact tracing were associated with private households (estimated attack rate 30%), followed by ""recreational context"" contacts (9% of putative transmissions, 13% transmission probability). Lower transmission probabilities in the 3% - 6.5% range observed for many contexts (e.g. workplaces, schools, residential care facilities) suggested effective infection prevention in these. All institutional outbreaks combined were associated with 5% of total cases; schools and kindergartens exhibited the highest (1.3 and 1.2, respectively), and care homes the lowest (0.2), number of outbreak-linked community cases per outbreak case. A sequencing-led search showed that routine contact tracing underestimated the number of cases associated with school outbreaks (18% increase in associated sequenced cases) and it detected previously unrecognized links between different outbreaks. Combining all available epidemiological data, we identified a putative infection source for 23.7% of sequenced cases; even when ignoring genetic constraints, however, 55.6% of all registered cases remained without a putative transmission source. The available genetic data indicated that a sequencing-led search for epidemiological connections across all sequenced cases could substantially contribute to the detection of transmission events not captured by routine contact tracing (upper bound 60.5% of sequenced cases with a putative infection source, assuming that that all genetic links imply a discoverable epidemiological connection). Different indicators of the ability to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission showed no evidence of saturation towards the achieved case sequencing proportion of 24.5%, suggesting that higher sequencing rates would have been desirable.

Among them, X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) is a hematuric nephropathy affecting the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) secondary to pathogenic variations in the COL4A5 gene encoding the 5 subunit of type IV collagen [5(IV)]. In patients carrying pathogenic variations affecting splicing, the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offers immense therapeutic hope. In this study, we develop a framework combining the use of patient-derived cells and kidney organoids to provide evidence of the therapeutic efficacy of ASOs in XLAS patients. Using multiomics analysis, we describe the development of GBM in wild-type and mutated human kidney organoids. We show that GBM maturation is a dynamic process, which requires long organoid culture. Then, using semi-automated quantification of 5(IV) at basement membranes in organoids carrying the splicing variants identified in patients, we demonstrate the efficacy of ASO treatment for 5(IV) restoration. These data contribute to our understanding of the development of GBM and pave the way for a therapeutic screening platform for patients.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

It is mediated by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and DNMT3B, in cooperation with catalytically inactive DNMT3L. Abnormal DNA methylation contributes to genomic instability and oncogenesis, yet the mechanisms governing its establishment and regulation remain unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the nucleosome-bound full-length DNMT3A2-3L and its oligomeric assemblies in the nucleosome-free state. Strikingly, DNMT3L C-terminal ""Switching Helix"" displayed a distinct conformation with a 180{degrees} rotational difference compared to its DNMT3B3 counterpart in the presence of nucleosome, preventing direct interactions with the nucleosome acidic patch. Instead, DNMT3L ADD domain promotes nucleosome binding, while DNMT3A PWWP domain inhibits it, indicating multi-layer regulation. Additionally, the novel oligomeric arrangement of DNMT3A2-3L in nucleosome-free states highlights its dynamic assembly and potential allosteric regulation. Furthermore, we identified the critical role of DNMT3L as a sensor of histone modifications, guiding the complexs chromatin interaction. These findings uncover a previously unknown mechanism by which DNMT3A-3L mediates de novo DNA methylation on chromatin through complex reorganization, histone tail sensing, dynamic DNA search, and nucleosome engagement, providing key insights into epigenetic regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory. Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics.

This provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of sensory entrainment in reversing autism-related cognitive deficits.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

To establish an infection, UPEC must evade infiltrating neutrophils and their antimicrobial neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In this study, we identify a previously uncharacterized two-gene regulatory system within the pathogenicity island PAIUTI89II, which we named DanRI (Defense against neutrophil Regulator and Inhibitor). DanRI is induced by nucleosomes present in NETs and enables UPEC to suppress neutrophil responses by attenuating reactive oxygen species production and NET formation. Mechanistically, DanI functions as an antagonist to the transcriptional regulator DanR, thereby modulating key bacterial processes, including metabolic processes, flagellar biosynthesis, and stress response pathways. DanRI is required for UPEC fitness and long-term persistence in a mouse model of UTI. Taken together, our findings reveal DanRI as a novel regulatory system that promotes UPEC pathogenesis through immune evasion.

Under physiological conditions, TDP-43 is predominantly localized in the nucleus, where it participates in a variety of cellular functions related to RNA splicing, transport, and stability, as well as miRNA biogenesis. In disease, it is characteristically mislocalized to the cytoplasm where it forms aggregates, which contribute to neurotoxicity and prion-like cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic TDP-43. Targeting of misfolded aggregates of TDP-43 represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. However, development of effective immunotherapeutic agents remains a challenge, as they require stringent selectivity for misfolded TDP-43 in order to maintain the essential functions of physiologically native TDP-43. To address this issue, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and intrabodies were generated against an epitope in the N-terminal domain of TDP-43 that is only exposed when the protein is misfolded, but not in its properly folded form. We show that mouse and rabbit mAbs against this epitope displayed high binding affinities by surface plasmon resonance analysis and selectively reacted with pathological TDP-43 in post-mortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and AD patients. In a cell line system, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, mAbs and corresponding intrabodies specifically reacted with cytoplasmic aggregates of transfected misfolded TDP-43 lacking the nuclear localization signal, TDP-43{Delta}NLS. Functionally, mAbs inhibited cell-to-cell transmission of misfolded TDP-43 and the seeding activity of misfolded TDP-43 from FTLD brain homogenates by novel RT-QuIC assay. Intrabodies promoted the degradation of intracellular aggregates of TDP-43 in HEK293T cells and in induced pluripotent stem cell---derived motor neurons (iPSC-MNs) from ALS patients. The results provide proof-of-concept evidence that supports selective targeting of misfolded toxic aggregates of TDP[ndash]43 as a potentially safe and effective avenue to treat neurodegenerative diseases associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

However, coverage of early ANC remains uneven across low-resource settings. This study assessed patterns and predictors of early antenatal care initiation in Zambia by analysing data from the 2007, 2013/14, and 2018 Demographic and Health Surveys, with an emphasis on equity-related disparities. Methods We analyzed pooled cross-sectional DHS data from 20,548 women aged 15-49 who had a recent live birth and received at least one ANC visit. Early ANC was defined as the first visit occurring during the first trimester. We generated weighted descriptive statistics, plotted trends over time, and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with early ANC initiation. Analyses accounted for complex survey design. Results Early ANC coverage rose from 19.7% in 2007 to 37.2% in 2018. Adolescents (15 - 19 years) made up 9.2% of the sample and had lower early ANC rates (26.3%) compared to older women (28.4%). Multivariable models revealed a consistent rise in early ANC over time, with each subsequent survey year associated with increased odds (AOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.11; p < 0.001). Older maternal age (AOR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.32; p = 0.039), higher educational attainment (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00 - 1.13; p = 0.049), and greater household wealth (AOR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.09; p = 0.039) were all associated with significantly greater odds of initiating ANC early. Urban residence was linked to decreased odds (AOR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.63 - 0.80; p < 0.001). Conclusion While early ANC coverage has improved in Zambia, gaps persist across age, education, wealth, and residence. Targeted interventions addressing adolescent needs and integrating cervical cancer prevention into ANC services may enhance timely care and promote health equity.

However, there is a population of TB patients who require longer treatment durations. Prospectively identifying those who require shorter versus longer treatment durations would support evaluation and implementation of optimized regimens.

MethodsWe analysed data from the RIFASHORT TB treatment-shortening non-inferiority trial to define a TB phenotype classification. The RIFASHORT trial primary outcome was reanalysed using the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion of eight percentage points, stratifying by those classified as having limited or extensive disease.

ResultsXpert MTB/RIF(R) semiquantitative bacterial burden in combination with TB disease involvement grading on chest X-ray achieved the strongest differentiation between relapse and non-relapse. The extensive disease TB phenotype (high semiquantitative bacterial burden and extensive TB disease on X-ray) accounted for one quarter of the RIFASHORT trial population and more than half of all post-treatment TB relapses (13/23). For the limited TB disease phenotype (<high semiquantitative bacterial burden or no extensive TB disease on X-ray), the experimental 4-month 1200mg rifampicin-containing regimen met the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion in both modified-intention-to-treat (adjusted risk difference: -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -6.7% to 4.0%)) and per protocol analyses (1.7% (95% CI: -3.8% to 7.1%)).

ConclusionA four-month treatment duration, with a widely available, tolerable, rifampicin-based TB treatment regimen, was non-inferior to the standard of care for three-quarters of people with TB in the RIFASHORT trial. This finding justifies definitive evaluation of disease-stratified rifampicin-based TB treatment in a phase III randomised trial.

Many studies have proposed methods for genome-wide association study (GWAS) in admixed populations and various simulation studies have evaluated their performances. In this work, we propose another direction of comparison of recently proposed methods for admixed GWAS from a population genetic viewpoint.

ResultsOur theoretical approach mathematically and directly compares the power of methods given that the causal variant is tested. This is done by deriving the variance formula of the methods from the population genetic admixture model. Our results analytically confirm previous observation that the standard GWAS test is more powerful than alternative tests due to leveraging allele frequency heterogeneity in which alternatives do not. As a by-product, we obtain a simple method to improve the power of multi-degrees-of-freedom tests only using summary statistics. We further investigate the problem when the causal variant is not directly known but is detected by tagging variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The analysis shows that a genetic segment from admixed genomes may exhibit distinct LD patterns from the single-continental counterpart of the same ancestry.

ConclusionsWhile the classic admixture model is successful in predicting GWAS power, its popular extension in the literature falls short in explaining the LD patterns found in simulations and real data, warranting an improved model for LD in admixed genomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

The practices in control and intervention groups were well balanced for practice characteristics, socioeconomic status according to postcode, and median number of patients per practice. Mean age of the patient cohort was 71.9 ({+/-}11.8) years, 68% were male and 24% had a prior myocardial infarction. At 24-months, there was no significant in between the control (11.5%) and intervention (10.6%) groups for unplanned CVD hospitalizations (relative risk: 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10). Similarly, there was no evidence that secondary outcomes of MACE, clinical measures, or medication prescriptions were different between the groups at 24 months. Conclusions: A primary care, 12-month data-driven quality improvement program did not improve unplanned hospitalizations, MACE or medication prescriptions for people with CHD at 24-month follow-up. Robust evidence for use of a data-driven, collaborative approach to improving care for people with coronary heart disease in primary care remains elusive.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

Here, we describe individual-level measures of estimated time since HIV infection (ETI) from viral next generation sequencing data among female sex workers and their clients in relation to significant geopolitical events in Ukraine. Methods: The Dynamics study, is a cross-sectional integrated biological and behavioural survey conducted among female sex workers and their clients in Dnipro, Ukraine (December 2017 to March 2018). We were able to successfully sequence a portion of the HIV pol gene on dried blood spot specimens among n = 5/9 clients and n = 5/16 female sex workers who tested positive for HIV (total n = 10/25) using an in-house drug resistance genotyping assay. The HIV EVO Intrapatient HIV Evolution web-based tool (https://biozentrum.unibas.ch/) was used to infer ETI from viral diversity. Results: The median ETI for female sex workers and their clients was 5.4 years (IQR = 2.9, 6.6) and 6.5 years (IQR = 5.4, 10.8) respectively. Nearly all HIV acquisition events (n=7/10; 70%) were estimated to have occurred between the Great Recession (2008 to 2009) and the War in Donbas (May 2014 to February 2022). In general, ETI suggests that HIV acquisition occurred earlier among clients (2012 [IQR = 2007, 2013]) compared to sex workers (2013 [IQR = 2012, 2016]). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that most HIV acquisition in this small subset of female sex workers and clients living with HIV, occurred during periods of economic decline. Molecular studies on timing of HIV acquisition against timing of major geopolitical events offer a novel way to contextualize how such events may shape transmission patterns.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein. However, the supercomplex structure and the role of the ring-like Csn2 protein remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type II-A prespacer selection supercomplex in the DNA-scanning and two different PAM-bound configurations. Our study uncovers the mechanism of Cas9-mediated prespacer selection in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, and reveals the role of the accessory protein Csn2, which serves as a platform for the assembly of Cas9 and Cas1-Cas2 integrase on prespacer DNA, reminiscent of the sliding clamp in DNA replication.

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpps contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.

ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is an increasing global health threat, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain incompletely understood. This work clarifies the role of the alarmone ppGpp in mediating antibiotic resistance in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Elevated levels of ppGpp were found to cause resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics targeting the cell wall synthesis enzyme PBP2. Resistance required transcriptional regulation by ppGpp and enzymatic activity of the cell wall enzyme PBP1B. This work suggests that ppGpp causes resistance in part by increasing expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. Because ppGpp levels are controlled by nutritional conditions, this work suggests that nutritional availability could impact the efficacy of antibiotics. Furthermore, this study adds to a number of studies demonstrating that cell wall synthesizing PBP enzymes can compensate for one another under certain conditions, leading to {beta}-lactam resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E ion channel activity triggers the proton pump V-ATPases to recruit the ATG16L1 complex during infection. This results in ATG8 molecules such as LC3B decorating perturbed compartments. This recruitment of autophagy machinery does not inhibit viral replication, rather SARS-CoV-2 exploits this response. Inhibition of the V-ATPase/ATG16L1 interaction using the Salmonella effector SopF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Careful distinction between use of the autophagic machinery from canonical macroautophagy is required in order to better understand coronavirus replication and for rational targeting of any potential host-directed therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

However, to characterize of the pleiotropic, molecular and population genetic bounds of uncovered loci, investigations are conducted, that remain conceptually and practically separated. Also in the best case, such investigations proceed by one locus at a time. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for executing haplotype-based association analysis on GWAS-identified genetic loci, which is especially helpful in samples enriched with molecular omics data. Haplomics takes as input the genetic coordinates of each locus along with all available clinical and molecular phenotypes, the necessary covariates, and VCF genotype files, to reconstruct haplotypes and test them for associations with the phenotypes. The reconstructed haplotypes, the annotation of included variants, and association results are graphically displayed in an HTML report. We tested Haplomics in population-based study sample encompassing 391 traits, including 72 clinical markers, 171 serum metabolites, 148 plasma protein concentrations, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) imputed genotypes. We estimated WES-based haplotypes at 11 kidney function genetic loci from a GWAS and conducted association analyses throughout, identifying 19 significant associations after multiple testing correction.

There is no biochemical process that can directly oxidize ammonium into nitrogen gas using nitrate under anaerobic conditions. In this study, mature anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) granular sludge was inoculated in an anaerobic nitrogen-removal system, while nitrate and ammonium were used as the influent substrates. The experiment was conducted for 537 days at a temperature of 30-32{degrees}C and a pH of 8.0-9.0. The transformation from nitrite-anammox to nitrate-anammox was stably achieved on the 350th day. The experimental results showed that, nitrate directly oxidized ammonium into nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions. The produced gas consisted of 96.3% nitrogen and 3.7% carbon dioxide. The removal ratio of ammonium to nitrate was approximately 1.67:1, and the total inorganic nitrogen removal rate reached up to 290.20 mg/(L{middle dot}d). Unlike the nitrite-anammox reaction, this reaction was accompanied by an acid production process, which caused a decrease in pH. When the substrate was changed to nitrite and ammonium, the total nitrogen removal rate of only 1.1-1.3 mg/(L{middle dot}d) was achieved. This new biochemical reaction of nitrogen was defined as nitrate-anammox. The study reveals a new pathway of nitrogen transformation, providing novel insights into the global nitrogen cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

Patients with SSD have been hypothesized to exhibit an accelerated decline in age-related cortical folding, quantified with the Local Gyrification Index (LGI). Here, we assessed longitudinal and cross-sectional LGI differences in patients with chronic SSD relative to healthy controls across 13 years.

Study DesignThe sample comprised patients with SSD (mean baseline age=41.28 years) and healthy controls (mean baseline age=41.56 years) with MRI acquisitions at baseline (103 SSD; 99 controls) and follow-up after 5 (50 SSD; 57 controls) and 13 years (42 SSD; 60 controls). T1-weighted images were processed with the longitudinal pipeline in FreeSurfer. Spatio-temporal linear mixed-effects models were used to test for longitudinal and cross-sectional case-control differences in LGI, as well as the impact of symptom severity and antipsychotic medication dose among patients.

Study ResultsAlthough cross-sectional LGI was lower in patients in extensive frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, we observed no significant differences in longitudinal trajectories between patients and controls after FDR correction. Medication dose was linked cross-sectionally to lower LGI of the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, and the postcentral gyrus.

ConclusionIn the longest longitudinal study on cortical folding in SSD to date, we found no accelerated progressive decline in cortical folding in patients. Thus, chronic SSD appears to be characterized by a state of stable hypogyria relative to healthy controls, supporting the interpretation of LGI as a marker of neurodevelopmental or early-life disturbances in SSD.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

In this study, we investigated the effect of allicin on the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain of the spike protein in human primary splenic fibroblasts. These cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding RBD-S protein fused to a superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP), a bright, stable marker. When cells were treated with 50{square}{micro}M allicin, either 30 min before or 6 h after transfection, a pronounced drop in fluorescence was observed, indicating reduced spike protein expression. Interestingly, the cell morphology, growth, and behavior remained normal, indicating that allicin could minimize spike protein levels without being toxic to the cells. These results open the door to the use of allicin as a gentle, natural antiviral agent and raise critical questions regarding the regulation of protein expression after transcription. Further research is required to understand these effects better.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Although theoretical models suggest that such divergence is notably facilitated by small population size and genetic polymorphisms influencing reproductive timing, though constrained by genetic load, empirical validation remains limited. We investigated these predictions by re-analyzing a case of allochronic differentiation between two sympatric populations of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Portugal, using whole genome resequencing (IndSeq and PoolSeq) of those two populations and eight allopatric ones. We inferred the demographic history of those populations, assessed their genetic load, and searched for genomic regions associated with life cycle differences. Our analyses revealed a recent split between the sympatric allochronic populations, accompanied by a strong reduction in gene flow, bottlenecks, inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious variants. Genome scans identified several loci associated with life cycle variation, including genes putatively involved in circadian rhythm regulation. These loci were predominantly located on the Z chromosome, which overall exhibited a marked reduction in diversity in the population with the shifted phenology, likely caused by a bottleneck and an interruption of gene flow at the Z in this population. We discuss how these empirical genomic findings support theoretical expectations that assortative mating driven by differences in reproductive timing, underpinned by polymorphisms in circadian genes, along with genetic drift and purge of genetic load at high-impact sites, can promote the onset and persistence of allochronic divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Simultaneously, pathogens secrete effectors to promote host colonization through various mechanisms, including targeted host microbiota manipulation. Here, we characterize the Av2 effector of the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae as a suppressor of the cry for help. Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment. We conclude that V. dahliae secretes Av2 to supress the cry for help by inhibiting the recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. to pave the way for successful plant invasion.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in SLE, its cell-type-specific impact on immune subsets remains underexplored.

MethodsWe repurposed existing RNA-seq data from SLE patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with a focus on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (NEmt) genes, as well as mitochondrial genes themselves, to identify differentially expressed genes compared to healthy controls. Mitochondrial stress tests were performed on freshly isolated CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients and healthy donors to assess bioenergetic function.

ResultsRNA-seq revealed that both NEmt genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in the PBMC population of SLE patients. In situ mitochondrial stress tests revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicating impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) across all immune subsets, while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, remained unchanged. These findings highlight immune-cell-specific mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in SLE, without compensatory glycolytic adaptation.

ConclusionOur results position mitochondrial fitness as a novel therapeutic target in SLE. We propose leveraging high-throughput screening of mitochondria-targeted compounds, including FDA-approved agents, to enhance OXPHOS, regulate mitophagy, or mitigate oxidative stress.

This precision-based approach offers a paradigm shift from conventional immunosuppression to metabolic recalibration, with the potential to restore immune homeostasis in SLE.

Key messagesO_LIWhat is already known on this topic:
Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming have been linked to SLE pathogenesis, but the cell-type-specific extent of mitochondrial impairment and its therapeutic potential remained unclear.
C_LIO_LIWhat this study adds:
We demonstrate reduced OXPHOS in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and monocytes from SLE patients for the first time, highlighting cell-type-specific mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible driver of immune dysregulation and target for therapy.
C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice, or policy:
This study advocates for drug repurposing to restore mitochondrial fitness, offering a novel therapeutic strategy to complement existing SLE treatments and improve patient outcomes.

Previous work has revealed a sweep-stick code in rat wS1 by using a novel whisker velocity-white noise stimulus. Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles. We hypothesized that barrel cortex neurons inherit  stick responses from the VPM and  sweep responses from the POm. Here we test this hypothesis by studying the coding strategy of both thalamic nuclei and wS1 in mice. We found a stratified wS1 representation of both sweep and stick functional classes, whereas VPM and POm contained mainly stick encoding neurons. Cortical layer 4  stick responses are a delayed version from VPM, while layer 5b  sweep responses come from POm. Notably, layer 5a  sweep responses result from a temporal integration of  stick information from VPM and POm. Our results put forward a circuit scheme in which fast encoding stick events from VPM allow a fine-tuned texture processing in the cortex, modulated by sweep-responding cells that integrate multi-whisker information.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (encoded by the gene xoxF) are now recognized as the key catalysts for methylotrophy in many environments, yet the identity of the most transcriptionally active methylotrophs (""Clade X"") has remained elusive. Here we show that ""Clade X"" methylotrophs belong to the deep-branching alphaproteobacterial order TMED127, which we propose be renamed  Methylaecorales;  methyl for  methylotrophic metabolism and  aecor for  ocean surface, as these bacteria are most transcriptionally active near the sea surface. TMED127/Methylaecorales have small, streamlined genomes ([~]1.5 Mb) and appear to be obligate methylotrophs that use the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. TMED127/Methylaecorales showed a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea. Several other highly transcribed genes of unknown function had no homologs outside of TMED127/Methylaecorales genomes. Our findings illuminate an overlooked marine methylotrophic bacterium and predict a diel cycle of methanol production in surface seawater by an unknown pathway.

TMED127/Methylaecorales likely require methanol as a carbon and energy source, and display a diel pattern of transcription of key genes for methylotrophy that peaks in the late afternoon. These findings motivate future studies on the mechanisms of methanol production in surface seawater.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

We investigated early metabolic markers of non-survival, and a potential microbial intervention using Bacteroides intestinalis-AM1, to improve outcomes in ALF.

MethodPlasma metabolomics and meta-proteomics were performed in 40 ALF patients and 5 healthy controls (training cohort). A non-survival marker panel was identified and validated in 270 ALF patients (test cohort) using high resolution mass spectrometry and machine learning. It was functionally validated in acetaminophen-induced ALF mouse model. B. intestinalis-AM1 was used to study alteration of gut bacteria and amelioration of liver injury.

ResultsALF non-survivors showed a distinct metabolomic signature with elevated primary bile acids {chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), cholic acid (CA)}, tryptophan, tyrosine, and enrichment of pathways linked to inflammation, cell death, and stress response (p<0.01, FDR<0.01, FC>1.5). Non-survivors had higher alpha/beta diversity (p<0.05) with increase in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria (p<0.05); functionally associated with energy, amino acid and xenobiotic metabolism (p<0.05). A gut microbiota derangement in converting primary to secondary bile acids was evident as CDCA and cytotoxic metabolites (4-(2-Amino phenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate, L-Tyrosine) were higher. Elevated CDCA (logFC>10) levels correlated with mortality in ALF patients as well as in mouse model. In the later, administration of B. intestinalis-AM1 bacteria, (10^9) reduced CDCA and CA levels by enhancing FXR, FGF15, SLC10A1 gene expression, attenuating inflammation (IL-1beta, TLR4-signalling), necroptosis, and modulating glutathione(oxidative-repair), tryptophan(inflammation), and histidine (tissue repair) metabolism.

ConclusionHigh levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) represent a poor prognostic indicator in ALF patients.

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated.

Validating the cytotoxic immune profile in blood using flow cytometry, we identified a cellular correlate of PRL exhibiting features of CD8+ TEMRA cells. Despite B-cell depletion, PRL-associated neuroinflammation, driven by myeloid activation and CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, persisted. Serum and CSF proteomic networks showed PRL-pertinent signatures, including networks unaffected by B-cell depletion. Using in silico perturbation, we nominated therapeutic targets, including MYD88, TNF, MYC, TYK2, JAK2, and BTK, for alleviating chronic neuroinflammation in MS. Our findings highlight mechanisms of chronic neuroinflammation in MS and point to potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1750111811839

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750111811839
