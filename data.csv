This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735164561949

However, there are other reorganizations of the network that do not involve fission and fusion. One such exception is the elusive, beads-on-a-string morphological transition of mitochondria. During such transitions, the cylindrical tubes of the mitochondrial membrane transiently undergo shape changes to a string of pearls connected along thin tubes. These dynamics have been anecdotally observed in many contexts and given disparate explanations. Here we unify these observations by proposing a common underlying mechanism based on the biophysical properties of tubular fluid membranes for which it is known that, under particular regimes of tension and pressure, membranes reach an instability and undergo a shape transition to a string of connected pearls. First, we use high-speed light-sheet microscopy to show that transient, short-lived pearling events occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial network in every cell type we have examined, including primary fibroblasts, T-cells, neurons, and budding yeast. We present evidence that transient mitochondrial pearling occurs during important biological events, particularly during T cell activation and neuronal firing. Using our high-temporal resolution data, we identify two distinct categories of spontaneous pearling, i) internal pressure-driven pearling regulated by ionic flux, and ii) external tension-driven pearling regulated by molecular motors. By applying live-cell STED microscopy we document the structural reorganization of inner cristae membranes during mitochondrial pearling. We then compare numerous methods for inducing pearling, including the ability to induce these dynamics with single mitochondrion precision. These methods include ionophores, channel activators, osmotic shock, detergents, laser stimulation, membrane intercalating molecules, chemical fixation, and micro-needle force. These disparate inducers establish three main physical causes of pearling, i) ionic flux amplifying internal osmotic pressure, ii) membrane packing lowering bending elasticity, and iii) external mechanical force increasing membrane tension. Pearling dynamics thereby reveal a fundamental biophysical facet of mitochondrial biology. We suggest that pearling should take its place beside fission and fusion as a key process of mitochondrial dynamics, with implications for physiology, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Our data reveal that mitochondria frequently undergo spontaneous and reversible pearling - a biophysical instability in which tubules undulate into regularly spaced beads. We discovered that pearling imposes a characteristic length scale, simultaneously mediating nucleoid disaggregation and establishing inter-nucleoid distancing with near-maximally achievable precision. Cristae invaginations play a dual role: lamellar cristae density determines pearling frequency and duration, and preserves the resulting nucleoid spacing after recovery. The distribution of mitochondrial genomes is thus fundamentally governed by the interplay between spontaneous pearling and cristae ultrastructure.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

We found that the translation initiation factor EIF4A1, which unwinds complex mRNA structures in the 5 UTR of oncogenic transcripts, is highly expressed in AML stem- and progenitor-like cells. Inhibiting eIF4A with the small molecule Zotatifin reduces translation of transcripts related to the cell cycle and survival. This results in downregulation of AKT, STAT-5, and MCL-1 and underlies synergy of Zotatifin with Venetoclax. The drug combination promotes apoptosis across AML genotypes, while the effect on healthy blood cells is limited. Using in vivo relapsed and refractory AML patient-derived xenograft models, the combination significantly suppressed tumor burden and prolonged survival of xenografted mice. These results support eIF4A-mediated protein translation as a therapeutic target in AML.

SIGNIFICANCEDespite advances in targeted therapies, the 5-year survival rate for acute myeloid leukemia remains around 32%. The efficacy of existing treatments may be improved with the addition of Zotatifin, an inhibitor targeting the translation initiation factor eIF4A.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Here, we increase the number of complete SAR11 isolate genomes fourfold by describing 81 new SAR11 strains from seven distinct lineages isolated from coastal and offshore surface seawater of the tropical Pacific Ocean. We leveraged comprehensive phylogenomic insights afforded by these isolates to characterize 24 monophyletic, discrete ecotypes with unique spatiotemporal patterns of distribution across the global ocean, which we define as genera. Our data illustrate fine-scale differentiation in patterns of detection with ecologically-relevant gene content variation for some closely related genomes, demonstrating instances of ecological speciation within SAR11 genera.

Yet, understanding the determinants of niche partitioning within SAR11 has been a formidable challenge due to the high genetic diversity within individual SAR11 sublineages and the limited availability of high-quality genomes from both cultivation and metagenomic reconstruction. Here, we take advantage of 71 new SAR11 genomes from strains we isolated from the tropical Pacific Ocean to evaluate the distribution of metabolic traits across the Pelagibacteraceae, a recently classified family within the order Pelagibacterales encompassing subgroups Ia and Ib. Our analyses of metagenomes generated from stations where the strains were isolated reveals distinct habitat preferences across SAR11 genera for coastal or offshore environments, and subtle but systematic differences in metabolic potential that support these observations. We also observe higher levels of selective forces acting on habitat-specific metabolic genes linked to SAR11 fitness and polyphyletic distributions of habitat preferences and metabolic traits across SAR11 subclades, suggesting that contrasting lifestyles have emerged across multiple lineages independently. Together, these insights reveal niche-partitioning within sympatric and parapatric populations of SAR11 and demonstrate that the immense genomic diversity of SAR11 bacteria naturally segregates into ecologically and genetically cohesive units, or ecotypes, that vary in spatial distributions in the tropical Pacific.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Upon autophagy induction, a unique double-membraned structure, called a phagophore, forms and expands into a cup shape to engulf these cytosolic substrates. ATG8 proteins are covalently conjugated to autophagic membranes by lipidation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and are thought to localise on both sides of the phagophore membrane. ATG8 conjugated on the inner membrane of the phagophore recruits autophagy cargo receptors, such as p62. To recapitulate events on the inner membrane, we used giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) as a model membrane and encapsulated proteins of interest inside GUVs, thus generating a membrane platform to which ATG8 proteins could be localised on the inner leaflet of the vesicles. We reconstituted WIPI2b-directed and cargo-directed ATG8 lipidation inside the GUVs and revealed distinct roles of WIPI2b and p62 in initiating the ATG conjugation cascade. Furthermore, we showed that p62 or p62 droplets were recruited to the inner membrane of the GUVs though interaction with membrane-bound ATG8s. Using a bead-based membrane expansion assay, we demonstrated a redistribution and local enrichment of membrane-bound ATG8s across the membrane upon interaction with p62 and p62 droplets. Our study provides novel model systems to investigate the interactions on the inner membrane of the phagophore and reveals fundamental molecular insights into phagophore membrane bending. This process is directed by ATG8-cargo interaction, during which cargo receptors concentrate ATG8 proteins on the inner surface of the phagophore membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Many species are motile, despite having no appendages and a completely rigid cell body. Cells move to seek out nutrients, locate mating partners, and undergo vertical migration. To explore the natural diversity of diatom motility, we perform a comparative study across five common biofilm-forming species. Combining morphological measurements with high-resolution cell tracking, we establish how gliding movements relate to the morphology of the raphe -- a specialised slit in the cell wall responsible for motility generation. Our detailed analyses reveal that cells exhibit a rich but species-dependent phenotype, switching stochastically between four stereotyped motility states. We model this behaviour and use stochastic simulations to predict how heterogeneity in microscale navigation patterns leads to differences in long-time diffusivity and dispersal. In a representative species, we extend these findings to quantify diatom gliding in complex, naturalistic 3D environments, suggesting that cells may exploit these distinct motility signatures to achieve niche segregation in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

While contemporary research has somewhat advanced our understanding of DMT, and psychedelics more broadly, there is little research that integrates time-resolved measures of subjective experience with temporally fine-grained brain imaging. We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker. These findings provide an important insight into how distinct neural dynamics may contribute to this radical and intense altered state of consciousness.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

In flowing environments, cells grow robustly at very low nutrient concentrations that are constantly replenished. Our simulation-guided experiments show how stopping flow halts growth within minutes and varying flow impacts growth gradients across bacterial populations. By precisely delivering nutrients using microfluidics, we learned that cells in flow can grow on glucose concentrations 1,000 times lower than those observed in typical laboratory experiments. The ultralow glucose concentrations sufficient for growth in flow closely align with the affinity of bacterial glucose transporters, suggesting that bacteria have evolved in flowing environments with scarce nutrients.

This study evaluates the performance of the Orbitrap Astral and Eclipse mass spectrometers in CLMS workflows, focusing on the identification of low-abundance crosslinked peptides. The comparison employed consistent liquid chromatography setups and experimental conditions, using Cas9 crosslinked with PhoX and DSSO as quality control samples. Results demonstrated that the Astral analyzer outperformed the Eclipse, achieving over 40% more unique residue pairs (URP) due to its superior sensitivity and dynamic range, attributed to its multi-reflection time-of-flight analyzer and nearly lossless ion transmission. Additionally, the study revealed that single higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation methods significantly outperformed stepped HCD methods on the Astral, while the Eclipse maintained similar performance across both approaches. Gradient optimization experiments further highlighted the impact of separation times on crosslink identifications, with longer gradients yielding higher identification rates. Collectively, this work underscores the importance of instrumentation choice, fragmentation strategies, and method optimization in maximizing CLMS performance for protein interaction studies.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735164561949

Despite decades of major advances and key insights from molecular systematics, organismal anatomical features remain a key source of biological data for both inferring phylogenies and investigating patterns of trait evolution among fossil and extant species. In paleobiology, morphologic characters are typically the only source of information available for reconstructing evolutionary trees. Systematists working with fossil data must make decisions regarding how morphological characters are modeled, whether they are continuous or categorical, and how to address biological sources of rate variation. To determine the impact of how different models of morphological evolution influence phylogenetic inferences and downstream comparative analyses of fossil data, we competed a series of increasingly complex model configurations of character evolution to a dataset of Cambrian-Ordovician trilobites containing both discrete morphological characters and continuous traits. Competed models vary in complexity, ranging from simple constant rate scenarios with only discrete categorical traits, to complex evolutionary models including both discrete and quantitative traits across multiple ecological partitions while accounting for multiple sources of rate variation. We compared topological distributions across competed models by visualizing their distances in multidimensional treespace. Results indicate the addition of continuous traits dramatically improves support for complex evolutionary scenarios. Remarkably, we find model complexity also has a major impact on which regions of treespace are explored, which suggests a critical need to carefully model morphologic evolution even when systematists are only interested in patterns of phylogenetic relationships alone.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, movements are regularly triggered and constantly corrected based on sensory inputs caused by disturbances to the body or environment. Since such disturbances are often predictable and since preparing for disturbances would make movements better, we hypothesized that expectations about sensory inputs also influence preparatory activity in motor circuits. Here we show that when humans and monkeys are probabilistically cued about the direction of a future mechanical perturbation, they incorporate sensory expectations into their movement preparation and improve their corrective responses. Using high-density neural recordings, we establish that sensory expectations are widespread across the brain, including the motor cortical areas involved in preparing self-initiated actions. The geometry of these preparatory signals in the neural population state is simple, scaling directly with the probability of each perturbation direction. After perturbation onset, a condition-independent perturbation signal shifts the neural state leading to rapid responses that initially reflect sensory expectations. Based on neural networks coupled to a biomechanical model of the arm3, we show that this neural geometry emerges through training, but only when the incoming sensory information indicating perturbation direction coincides with - or is preceded by - a condition-independent signal indicating that a perturbation has occurred. Thus, motor circuit dynamics are shaped by future sensory inputs, providing clear empirical support for the idea that movement is governed by the sophisticated manipulation of sensory feedback4.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

While advances in cell-free biocatalysis are improving nsAA synthesis cost and sustainability, such processes remain reliant on multi-step processes of product isolation followed by supplementation to engineered cells. Here, we report the design of a modular and genetically encoded system that combines the steps of biosynthesis of diverse phenylalanine derivatives, which are the most frequently used family of nsAAs for genetic code expansion, and their site-specific incorporation within target proteins using a single engineered bacterial host. Unlike previous demonstrations in which individual nsAAs were targeted for biosynthesis and site-specific incorporation, our system serves as a platform that exhibits broad substrate specificity towards commercially ubiquitous, achiral building blocks of aryl aldehydes or carboxylic acids. We demonstrate that this modular system enables high fidelity biosynthesis and incorporation of nsAAs for multiple industrially relevant nsAAs, such as the incorporation of 4,4-L-biphenylalanine within proteins after supplementation with biphenylaldehyde and the incorporation of 4-azido-L-phenylalanine within proteins after supplementation with 4-azido-benzoic acid. Finally, we show that the combination of nsAA biosynthesis and incorporation steps can extend the chemical reach of the intrinsic biological containment strategy of synthetic auxotrophy from nsAAs to low-cost and achiral building blocks. We anticipate that our system will aid industrial-scale manufacturing of proteins that contain nsAAs and democratize access to expensive or commercially unavailable chemistries for labs that lack separations or synthesis expertise.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

The growing availability of biological data has driven the development of a variety of in silico perturbation methods designed for single-cell analysis, which offer a means to address many inherent limitations of experimental approaches. However, these computational methods are often tailored to specific scenarios and validated on limited datasets and metrics, making their evaluation and comparison challenging. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmarking framework to systematically evaluate in silico perturbation methods across four key scenarios: predicting effects of unseen perturbations in known cell types, predicting effects of observed perturbations in unseen cell types, zero-shot transfer to bulk RNA-seq of cell lines, and application to real-world biological cases. For each scenario, we curated diverse and abundant datasets, standardizing them into flexible formats to enable efficient analysis. Additionally, we developed multiple metrics tailored to each scenario, facilitating a thorough and comparative evaluation of these methods. Our benchmarking study assessed 10 methods, ranging from linear baselines to advanced machine learning approaches, across these scenarios. While some methods demonstrated surprising efficacy in specific contexts, significant challenges remain, particularly in zero-shot predictions and the modeling of complex biological processes.

Existing tools for uncovering co-evolutionary signals primarily rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), often neglecting considerations of phylogenetic relatedness and shared evolutionary history. Here, we present a novel approach based on the substitution mapping of amino acid changes onto the phylogenetic tree. We categorize amino acids into two groups: 'tolerable' and 'intolerable,' and assign them to each position based on the position dynamics concerning the observed amino acids. Amino acids deemed 'tolerable' are those observed phylogenetically independently and multiple times at a specific position, signifying the position's tolerance to that alteration. Gaps are regarded as a third character type, and we only consider phylogenetically independent altered gap characters. Our algorithm is based on a tree traversal process through the nodes and computes the total amount of substitution per branch based on the probability differences of two groups of amino acids and gaps between neighboring nodes. We employ an MSA-masking approach to mitigate misleading artifacts from poorly aligned regions. When compared to tools utilizing phylogeny (CAPS and CoMap) and state-of-the-art MSA-based approaches (DCA, GaussDCA, PSICOV, and MIp), our method exhibits significantly superior accuracy in identifying co-evolving position pairs, as measured by statistical metrics including MCC, AUC, and F1 score.

Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

CD4 T cell deficiency during persistent infection incurs a shift from a T-dependent (TD) to T-independent (TI) Ab response, resembling the pre-existing TI Ab response. CD4 T cell loss before infection or during persistent infection is conducive for emergence of Ab-escape variants.

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode [~] 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or - containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense.

Here, we demonstrate in vitro and in Drosophila cells that the mitotic kinase POLO phosphorylates PP187B at a conserved residue (T286) within a pocket implicated in the recognition of RVxF-containing target proteins. Phosphorylation of T286 inhibits PP187B binding to the RVxF motif of the SAC kinase MPS1, dampening the dephosphorylation of MPS1 T-loop. Phosphorylation of T286 is dynamically regulated during mitosis. It occurs at unattached/tensionless kinetochores and decreases as chromosomes congress. Expression of phosphomimetic PP187BT286D prevents MPS1 inactivation in metaphase and causes a SAC-dependent delay of anaphase onset. Conversely, an unphosphorylatable PP187BT286A mutant impairs MPS1 activation at unattached kinetochores and weakens the SAC. In vivo, larval neuroblasts expressing PP187BT286 phosphomutants exhibit frequent chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy. Thus, our findings identify POLO-mediated phosphorylation of PP187B as a critical regulatory strategy that fine-tunes phosphatase activity to ensure a robust and timely SAC and prevent genome instability.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, pathogen effectors can evolve to avoid immune recognition, resulting in devastating diseases that threaten global agriculture. Here, we show that an integrated Exo70 domain from the barley NLR RGH2 can interact with both the rice blast pathogen effector AVR-Pii and a closely related wheat blast variant. We used structure-led engineering to develop RGH2+ that shows increased binding affinity towards AVR-Pii variants and increased cell death responses on heterologous expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Infection assays in transgenic barley lines harbouring RGH2+ (along with the paired NLR RGH3) show reduced virulence towards blast strains expressing AVR-Pii variants. These results demonstrate the potential of engineering NLR receptors as an effective strategy for improving resistance towards one of the most destructive diseases affecting cereal production.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Moreover, profiling TMAs allows efficient screening of tissue samples for translational and clinical applications. Multiplexed imaging technologies allow for spatial profiling of proteins at single cell resolution, providing insights into tumour microenvironments (TMEs) and disease mechanisms. High-plex spatial single cell protein profiling is a powerful tool for biomarker discovery and translational cancer research, however, there remain limited options for end-to-end computational analysis of this type of data. Here, we introduce PRISM, a Python package for interactive, end-to-end analyses of TMAs with a focus on translational and clinical research using multiplexed proteomic data from the CODEX, Phenocycler Fusion (Akoya Biosciences), Comet (Lunaphore), MACSima (Miltenyi Biotec), CosMx and Cellscape (Bruker Spatial Biology) platforms. PRISM leverages the SpatialData framework to standardise data storage and ensure interoperability with single cell and spatial analysis tools. It consists of two main components: TMA Image Analysis for marker-based tissue masking, TMA dearraying, cell segmentation, and single cell feature extraction; and AnnData Analysis for quality control, clustering, iterative cell-type annotation, and spatial analysis. Integrated as a plugin within napari, PRISM provides an intuitive and purely interactive graphical interface for real-time and human-in-the-loop analyses. PRISM supports efficient multi-resolution image processing and accelerates bioinformatics workflows using efficient scalable data structures, parallelisation and GPU acceleration.

Recent studies have demonstrated that histone missense mutations can perturb normal histone function, promoting the development of phenotypically distinguishable cancers. However, most histone mutations observed in cancer patients remain enigmatic in their potential to promote cancer development. To assess the oncogenic potential of histone missense mutations, we have gathered whole-exome sequencing data for the tumors of over 12,000 patients. Overall, histone mutations occurred in about 16% of cancer patients, although specific cancer types showed substantially higher rates. Using a combination of genomic, structural, and biophysical analyses, we found several predominant modes of action, where cancer missense mutations in histones affected acidic patches and protein binding interfaces in a cancer-specific manner and targeted interaction sites with specific DNA repair proteins. Consistent with this finding, we observed a high tumour mutational burden in patients with histone mutations affecting interactions of DNA repair proteins. We also identified potential cancer driver mutations in several histone genes, including histone H4-a highly conserved histone without previously documented driver mutations.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

The recent introduction of KRAS inhibitors has been a source of tremendous enthusiasm; however, therapeutic resistance has emerged, and combination approaches are needed. In particular, it is important to understand how downstream signaling of KRAS supports PDAC growth. For example, DUSP6, a dual-specificity phosphatase that modulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and RAS pathway activity, has emerged as an important regulator of KRAS-MAPK signaling. Analysis across diverse bulk RNA-seq datasets revealed that DUSP6 is markedly overexpressed in primary tumor samples compared to non-tumoral pancreatic tissue. Interestingly, both human bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data indicated that DUSP6 was upregulated in epithelial cells within the tumor. Further examination showed that DUSP6 was also overexpressed in metastatic samples relative to primary tumor samples, and this upregulation correlated with the quasi-mesenchymal/squamous molecular subtype. Pertaining to its clinical significance, patients with high DUSP6 expression exhibited a poorer prognosis for overall survival than those with low expression. Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis of publicly available datasets revealed the enrichment of pathways associated with cell migration and metabolism in metastatic samples. To elucidate the role of DUSP6 in these pathways, we developed PDAC cell lines stably knocked down DUSP6 and observed a concurrent increase in ERK/MAPK activation. Additionally, suppression of DUSP6 demonstrated PDAC cell-specific alterations in migratory capacity . Next, we assessed the metabolism of PDAC cell lines following DUSP6 knockdown and observed a notable increase in basal glycolysis. Interestingly, despite the observed alterations in migratory capacity and glycolytic metabolism upon DUSP6 modulation, the combined approach of DUSP6 downregulation and glycolysis inhibition failed to affect the observed migratory phenotype, suggesting that glycolytic demands did not drive the migratory phenotype . In summary, these findings suggest that DUSP6 elicits two independent functions in PDAC: migratory capacity and glycolysis metabolism, providing new insights into the function of DUSP6 in PDAC.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Models invoke phase separation of conformational ensembles of chromatin fibers as a mechanism regulating chromatin organization in vivo. Here we combine biochemistry and molecular dynamics simulations to examine, at single base-pair resolution, how nucleosome spacing controls chromatin phase separation. We show that as DNA linkers extend from 25 bp to 30 bp, as examplars of 10N+5 and 10N (integer N) bp lengths, chromatin condensates become less thermodynamically stable and nucleosome mobility increases. Simulations reveal that this is due to trade-offs between inter- and intramolecular nucleosome stacking, favored by rigid 10N+5 and 10N bp linkers, respectively. A remodeler can induce or inhibit phase separation by moving nucleosomes, changing the balance between intra- and intermolecular stacking. The intrinsic phase separation capacity of chromatin enables fine tuning of compaction and dynamics, likely contributing to heterogeneous chromatin organization in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

While cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD+ depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification-based anti-phage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, due to the high noise in the unspliced/spliced data for individual genes, existing RNA velocity models often fail to accurately capture the dynamics between unspliced and spliced abundance in the phase portraits of many genes. In addition, optimizing the high dimensional dynamics of all genes within a global framework and effectively handling multi-lineage data still require further exploration in RNA velocity modeling. Inspired by the role of transcriptional regulation in linking genes into complex networks and providing additional context for gene dynamics modeling, we propose TSvelo. TSvelo integrates cross-gene transcriptional regulation and gene-specific splicing processes of all genes into one neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based framework. By incorporating cell-specific transcriptional rates with the unspliced-spliced data, TSvelo precisely models the dynamics of velocity genes, learns global pseudotime, and can be extended to multi-branch datasets. Experiments on six scRNA-seq datasets, including two multi-branch datasets, demonstrate that TSvelo outperforms existing methods in modeling gene dynamics, inferring cell pseudotime and trajectories, and analyzing gene expression patterns across branches.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Here we establish a standardized evaluation framework and systematically assess 9 single-cell perturbation prediction models on 17 diverse datasets, spanning multiple cell types and perturbation modalities. Leveraging a multifaceted suite of 24 evaluation metrics, we find that models often excel in capturing global expression profiles yet struggle to predict the nuanced effects of perturbed genes, or vice versa.

SHM allows B cells to rapidly evolve new antibody sequences without compromising their fitness as a consequence of genome-wide mutations. In this work, we developed a continuous directed evolution platform in human B cell lines (CODE-HB) that recruits and repurposes the SHM mechanisms to rapidly evolve reporter proteins like the Green Fluorescent Protein. This approach uses a stable, non-immunoglobulin locus within the genomes of human B cell lines. To comprehensively characterize the mutational profile and breadth of this strategy, we performed single-molecule sequencing experiments.

Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, their biosynthetic pathways remain largely elusive. In the past decades, increasing numbers of plant biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated based on approaches utilizing genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. These efforts, however, are limited by the fact that they typically adopt a target-based approach, requiring prior knowledge. Here, we present MEANtools, a systematic and unsupervised computational integrative omics workflow to predict candidate metabolic pathways de novo by leveraging knowledge of general reaction rules and metabolic structures stored in public databases. Our approach identifies possible connections between metabolites and transcripts that show correlated abundance across samples using reaction rules linked to the transcript-encoded enzyme families. MEANtools thus assesses whether these reactions can connect transcript-correlated mass features within a candidate metabolic pathway. We validate MEANtools using a paired transcriptomic-metabolomic dataset recently generated to reconstruct the falcarindiol biosynthetic pathway in tomato. MEANtools correctly anticipated five out of seven steps of the characterized pathway and identified other candidate pathways involved in specialized metabolism, demonstrating its potential for hypothesis generation. Altogether, MEANtools represents a significant advancement in integrating multi-omics data to elucidate biochemical pathways in plants and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Shelterin is composed of six proteins (TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, TPP1, POT1 and RAP1) that can assemble into various subcomplexes in vitro. However, the stoichiometry of the shelterin complex and its dynamic association with telomeres in cells is poorly defined. To quantitatively analyze the shelterin function in living cells we generated a panel of cancer cell lines expressing HaloTagged shelterin proteins from their endogenous loci. We systematically determined the total cellular abundance and telomeric copy number of each shelterin subunit, demonstrating that the shelterin proteins are present at telomeres in equal numbers. In addition, we used single-molecule live-cell imaging to analyze the dynamics of shelterin protein association with telomeres. Our results demonstrate that TRF1-TIN2-TPP1- POT1 and TRF2-RAP1 form distinct subcomplexes that occupy non-overlapping binding sites on telomeric chromatin. TRF1-TIN2-TPP1-POT1 tightly associates with chromatin, while TRF2- RAP1 binding to telomeres is more dynamic, allowing it to recruit a variety of co-factors to chromatin to protect chromosome ends from DNA repair factors. In total, our work provides critical mechanistic insight into how the shelterin proteins carry out multiple essential functions in telomere maintenance and significantly advances our understanding of macromolecular structure of telomeric chromatin.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Gastruloids, self-organizing stem cell-based models of post-implantation mammalian development, provide a powerful platform to address this question. Here, we show that physical parameters, particularly system size, critically influence the timing and outcomes of morphogenetic processes. Larger gastruloids exhibit delayed symmetry breaking, increased multipolarity, and prolonged axial elongation, with morphogenesis driven by system size. Despite these variations, transcriptional programs and cell fate composition remain remarkably stable across a broad size range. Notably, extreme sizes show distinct transcriptional modules and clear shifts in gene expression patterns. Intriguingly, size perturbation experiments rescued the morphogenetic and pattern phenotypes observed in extreme sizes, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of gastruloids to their effective system size. These findings establish gastruloids as versatile models for studying spatiotemporal dynamics in mammalian embryogenesis and reveal how physical constraints decouple transcriptional from morphogenetic programs.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

A range of methods have been developed to detect unusual clusters of infections in these settings; however use of explicitly 3-D (x,y,z) spatial data has received little attention. In this study, we use data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic to assess the fine-scale spatial epidemiology and the clustering of confirmed cases to better understand impacts of spatial resolution and aggregation on spatio-temporal cluster detection. Methods Data for this analysis combined the results from mandatory weekly viral testing during the 2020-2021 academic year with high-resolution spatial data from university students residing in high-rise residence halls at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst campus. These data were analyzed for statistically-significant clustering of SARS-CoV-2 cases in three- dimensional space as well as time, within and between the high-density buildings on campus. Two sets of analyses were conducted. The first used a Space-Time Permutation Model, which scans for areas with a greater than expected number of cases (SaTScan). To assess the impact of data aggregation, analysis was done at several levels of spatial resolution. Additionally, we performed sensitivity analyses using a purely temporal surveillance algorithm, CDC's Early Aberration Reporting System- (EARS). Results and conclusions Analysis with SaTScan at the room- and floor-level identified multiple statistically significant clusters within one residence hall. Analyses with these same cases aggregated at the floor-level were found to be as sensitive, but far less computationally intensive, than room-level analysis. Analysis at both of these spatial scales was more sensitive than analysis aggregated at the street address-level. Two events exceeding alert thresholds were detected in the purely temporal analysis; one of which was also detected in spatio-temporal analyses. These results expand our understanding of spatio-temporal scan metrics to include 3-D analysis, and optimizing choice of spatial scales. These results have broad applicability in epidemiology in assessing the ability of spatio-temporal methods for public health surveillance, with potential expansion to ecological studies incorporating vertical movement.","NA","medrxiv",1735164561949

Although it is well known that protein synthesis is finely regulated in the brain, especially at synapses, where mRNAs are locally translated in activity-dependent manner, little is known as to the changes in the synaptic proteome and transcriptome during aging. Therefore, this work aims to elucidate the relationship between transcriptome and proteome at soma and synaptic level during aging. Proteomic and transcriptomic data analysis reveal that, in young animals, proteins and transcripts are correlated and synaptic regulation is driven by changes in the soma. During aging, there is a decoupling between transcripts and proteins and between somatic and synaptic compartments. Furthermore, soma-synapse gradient of ribosomal genes changes upon aging, i.e. ribosomal transcripts are less abundant and ribosomal proteins are more abundant in synaptic compartment of old mice with respect to younglings. Additionally, transcriptomics data highlight a difference in the splicing of certain synaptic mRNA with aging. Taken together, our data provide a valuable resource for the study of the aging synapse.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, stable genome editing in plants remains limited by the time- and labor- intensive process of generating transgenic plants, as well as by the efficient isolation of desired heritable edits. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

ZAP interacts with several cofactors to form the ZAP antiviral system, including KHNYN, a multidomain endoribonuclease required for ZAP-mediated RNA decay. However, it is unclear how the individual domains in KHNYN contribute to its activity. Here, we demonstrate that the KHNYN amino terminal extended-diKH (ex-diKH) domain is required for antiviral activity and present its crystal structure. The structure belongs to a rare group of KH-containing domains, characterized by a non-canonical arrangement between two type-1 KH modules, with an additional helical bundle. N4BP1 is a KHNYN paralog with an ex-diKH domain that functionally complements the KHNYN ex-diKH domain. Interestingly, the ex-diKH domain structure is present in N4BP1-like proteins in lancelets, which are basal chordates, indicating that it is evolutionarily ancient. While many KH domains demonstrate RNA binding activity, biolayer interferometry and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the KHNYN ex-diKH domain does not bind RNA. Furthermore, residues required for canonical KH domains to bind RNA are not required for KHNYN antiviral activity. By contrast, an inter-KH domain cleft in KHNYN is a potential protein-protein interaction site and mutations that eliminate arginine salt bridges at the edge of this cleft decrease KHNYN antiviral activity. This suggests that this domain could be a binding site for an unknown KHNYN cofactor.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

It broadly comprises three developmental phases - embryogenesis, maturation, and germination. Among these phases, seed maturation is particularly critical, serving as a bridge between embryo development and germination. During this phase, seeds accumulate nutrient reserves and acquire essential physiological traits, such as desiccation tolerance, vital for seed survival in diverse environments. Phylotranscriptomics in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that embryogenesis and germination follow an hourglass-like development, with high expression of older and conserved genes at the mid-developmental stages. However, unlike embryogenesis and germination, a phylotranscriptomic study of seed maturation has not yet been performed and a comprehensive overview of the phylotranscriptomic landscape throughout the entire seed life cycle is still lacking. Here, we combined existing RNA-seq data covering all three phases of the Arabidopsis seed life cycle to construct a complete picture of the phylotranscriptomic pattern of the seed life cycle by generating transcriptome age index (TAI) and transcriptome divergence index (TDI) profiles. We found that the seed life cycle resembles a reverse hourglass-like pattern, with seed maturation exhibiting increased expression of younger genes with divergent expression patterns compared to embryogenesis and germination. Notably, this pattern of increased expression of younger genes during seed maturation is also conserved across both dicot and monocot species. Tissue-specific phylotranscriptomic analyses revealed that, in monocots, the increased expression of younger genes during maturation is largely driven by genes expressed in the endosperm. Overall, our findings highlight the major shifts in phylotranscriptomic patterns during the seed life cycle and establish seed maturation as a pivotal developmental phase enabling the expression of young and rapidly evolving genes critical for seeds adaptive capacity in their surrounding environment.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

In this study, we elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of triculamin through heterologous expression and show that the biosynthesis proceeds in the presence of a precursor (triA), macrocyclase (triC), and acetyltransferase (triT). Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin-like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non-canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin-like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin-like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin-like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross-phylum distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

While most well-characterized phages have narrow host ranges, broad-host-range phages represent an intriguing component of marine ecosystems. The genetic and evolutionary mechanisms driving their generalism remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed Schizotequatroviruses and their Vibrio crassostreae hosts, collected from an oyster farm. Schizotequatroviruses exhibit broad host ranges, large genomes (~252 kbp) encoding 26 tRNAs, and conserved genomic organization interspersed with recombination hotspots. These recombination events, particularly in regions encoding receptor-binding proteins and antidefense systems, highlight their adaptability to host resistance. Notably, some lineages demonstrated receptor-switching between OmpK and LamB, showcasing their evolutionary flexibility. Despite their broad host range, Schizotequatroviruses were rare in the environment. Their scarcity could not be attributed to burst size, which was comparable to other phages in vitro, but may result from ecological constraints or fitness trade-offs, such as their preference for targeting generalist vibrios in seawater rather than the patho-phylotypes selected in oyster farms. Our findings clarify the genetic and ecological trade-offs shaping Schizotequatrovirus generalism and provide a foundation for future phage applications in aquaculture and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Despite the critical importance of antibodies in a wide range of areas of biomedical significance, the traditional process of antibody discovery is limited by inefficiency, high costs and failure rates, fundamental logistical hurdles, limited scalability potential, and long turnaround times. Recent computational biology efforts, including machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, have proven to have critical capabilities and advantages over purely experimental techniques, disrupting a number of areas that have traditionally met with limited success, such as protein structure modeling, enzyme engineering, drug design, and others (1-3). In the context of antibodies, AI-based approaches have been developed to optimize existing antibodies and generate novel antibody sequences in a target-agnostic manner (4-6). However, the ability of AI approaches to generate novel paired antibody sequences against a specific target (antigen) of interest has not been validated. In this work, we present MAGE (Monoclonal Antibody GEnerator), a sequence-based protein Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for the task of generating paired variable heavy and light chain antibody sequences against antigens of interest. Here we show that MAGE is capable of efficiently generating diverse antibody sequences that are distinct from the antibody sequences found in the training datasets, with experimentally validated binding specificity against SARS- CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), an emerging avian influenza H5N1 viral hemagglutinin (H5), and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A) prefusion F. MAGE is trained on protein sequence alone and requires only an antigen sequence as input for antibody design, with no need for a preexisting antibody template. MAGE represents a first-in-class model capable of designing human antibodies with demonstrated functionality against multiple targets. AI models for generation of human antibodies will provide unique and disruptive capabilities in the far-reaching field of antibody science.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

While organoids and organs-on-chip mitigate this problem by introducing biomimetic in-vitro microenvironments in late pre-clinical stages, there is a lack of biomimetic platforms in earlier stages, particularly for high-throughput imaging screening (HTS). Something as simple as a thin hydrogel layer would provide physiological stiffness and native-like biochemical cues. However, casting hydrogels inside the small-diameter wells of HTS plates creates high-curvature menisci that negatively affect cell seeding and microscopy readouts. Here, we present a solution to this problem: HYdrogel Dispensing with Robotic Automation or HYDRA. This method allows automatic dispensing and aspiration of hydrogel precursors while preventing meniscus formation. Using this approach, we can produce gelatin hydrogels with tunable stiffnesses and thickness at room temperature and in commercial HTS plates. Then, we validate HYDRA in dose-response studies for anti-cancer drugs nocodazole and paclitaxel using genetically engineered epithelial cells (HaCaT) and imaging-based HTS readout methods such as phase holography and fluorescence microscopy. Taken together, this work shows that pharmaceutical companies can readily apply HYDRA with their current infrastructure to produce more biomimetic and predictive HTS platforms.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Remarkably, in the absence of such signals, collections of pluripotent stem cells can still self-organise and break symmetry in vitro. One such example is gastruloids, three-dimensional stem cell aggregates that form an anterior-posterior axis through the polarised expression of the gene Brachyury/T. How robust and reproducible cell proportions are achieved in these self-organised embryo-like structures is not understood. Here, through quantitative experiments and theoretical modelling, we dissect tissue rheology and cellular feedback in gastruloids. We show that the initial population of Brachyury-expressing cells critically influences the timing of symmetry-breaking. We propose a cell differentiation model, whereby pluripotent cells inhibit mesoderm differentiation, accounting for the observed cell fate dynamics. Our findings suggest that cell-cell communication dictates temporal cell proportions, while differential tissue mechanics governs spatial pole formation. Our work highlights the importance of initial cell heterogeneity in gastruloid development and offers a framework to identify feedback mechanisms in multicellular systems, advancing our understanding of how embryo-like structures self-organise.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, the major exception to this rule has been found in many bivalve species which allow the presence of long unassigned region (regions that are functionally unassigned). It is still unclear whether there are universal patterns to expansions across bivalves. Additionally, the prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within complex mitogenomes has prevented its complete assembly and led to its systematic omission from mitogenomic analyses. Here, leveraging the growing genomic resources in Mollusca, we devised a mitogenome assembly pipeline using long-read sequencing to characterize mitogenome features in 178 mollusk species. Comparing our assemblies with reference mitogenomes based on Sanger/short-read sequencing, we identified missing sequences, repeats and novel gene duplications and found that bivalves exhibit an exceptional diversity in mitogenome size compared to other mollusks. Subsequently, we investigated the factors potentially influencing mitogenome size, the potential functional elements and the patterns of expansion regions. Furthermore, we discussed that the possible selective pressure on mitogenome size and hypothesized that the variability of bivalve mitogenomes may be linked to innate immunity. Our findings underscore the significance of long-read sequencing in elucidating complex mitogenomes and provide new insights into the evolution of bivalve mitogenomes.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

The closely related transcriptional co-regulators YAP and TAZ (WWTR1) have emerged as important drivers of tumour initiation and progression in various types of squamous cell carcinoma. How YAP and TAZ execute their oncogenic functions in squamous cancers is still not fully understood. Here, we report that in addition to controlling transcriptional programmes that determine the balance between proliferation and terminal differentiation, YAP also engages with RIF1, a key regulator of DNA replication timing and protector of stalled replication forks under replication stress. YAP modulates gene expression of RIF1 via TEAD transcription factors, and also stabilizes RIF1 protein on the chromatin. YAP-RIF1 complex formation increases in response to exogenous replication stress, and treatment with hydroxyurea to induce replication fork stalling acts synergistically with YAP depletion to impair cell proliferation. Our results thus demonstrate that YAP's oncogenic functions in squamous cell carcinoma involve both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms, and that RIF1 is key for squamous cell carcinoma cells to survive with their high levels of endogenous replication stress.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Affecting an estimated 15% of COVID-19 patients, long COVID manifests in a wide range of symptoms. Despite extensive research on its one-year effects, limited data exist beyond 12 months. Due to the different manifestations of long COVID, its diagnosis can be challenging. Identifying potential mechanistic contributors and biomarkers would be highly valuable. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) as biomarkers for disease stratification in COVID-19. Specifically, we have recently identified miR-144-3p and a subset of lncRNAs as candidates for assessing disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19. This study extends such investigations to 98 long COVID patients recruited 18 months after hospitalization, exploring the relationship between circulating ncRNA expression and persistent symptoms. While miR-144-3p, HCG18, and lncCEACAM21 expression did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, LEF1-AS1 was downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of symptomatic patients. Of note, multiple LEF1-AS1 isoforms and LEF1 sense transcript levels were reduced and negatively correlated with relevant clinical markers. While further studies are needed, our discoveries offer new perspectives for the diagnosis and management of persistent long COVID.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

It induces pulmonary inflammation and activates multiple stress signaling pathways in bronchial epithelial cells, including the integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR is triggered by phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety of insults and is functionally antagonised by the eIF2alpha phosphatase subunit PPP1R15A. Deletion of PPP1R15A exaggerates the ISR and in many models protects against a cellular stress. However, loss of PPP1R15A was recently shown to exaggerate pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin-challenged mice. We therefore wished to understand the role of PPP1R15A in the pulmonary response to cigarette smoke, which can cause both COPD and pulmonary fibrosis. Whole cigarette smoke rapidly activated the ISR in mucociliary differentiated human primary bronchial epithelial cells with those from COPD patients exhibiting higher levels of ISR. Acute exposure to cigarette smoke condensate induced a pro-inflammatory cytokine response accompanied by PPP1R15A expression. In this model, PPP1R15A induction was independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation but was suppressed by antioxidants suggesting a response to oxidative stress. In vivo studies in mice revealed that PPP1R15A deficiency enhanced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in mice, suggesting a regulatory role for PPP1R15A in modulating the inflammatory response to smoke. Taken together, these data suggest that PPP1R15A is induced by cigarette smoke by an ISR-independent oxidative stress mechanism and ameliorates the pro-inflammatory cytokine response to cigarette smoke.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

Much of the evolutionary history of kobuviruses remains elusive, largely due to limited screening in wildlife. Bats have been implicated as major sources of virulent zoonoses, including coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses, though much of the bat virome still remains uncharacterized. While most bat virus research has historically focused on immediately recognizable zoonotic clades (e.g. SARS-related coronaviruses), a handful of prior reports catalog kobuvirus infection in bats and posit the role of bats as potential progenitors of downstream kobuvirus evolution. As part of a multi-year study, we carried out metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on fecal samples obtained from endemic, wild-caught Madagascar fruit bats to characterize potentially zoonotic viruses circulating within these populations. The wild bats of Madagascar represent diverse Asian and African phylogeographic histories, presenting a unique opportunity for viruses from disparate origins to mix, posing significant public health threats. Here, we report detection of kobuvirus RNA in Malagasy fruit bat (Eidolon dupreanum) feces and undertake phylogenetic characterization of one full genome kobuvirus sequence, which nests within the Aichivirus A clade - a kobuvirus clade known to infect a wide range of hosts including humans, rodents, canids, felids, birds, and bats. Given the propensity of kobuviruses for recombination and cross-species infection, further characterization of this clade is critical to accurate evaluation of future zoonotic threats.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

However, the high cost of NA fluorometers presents a barrier to eDNA sequencing in resource limited settings (RLSs). For instance, at [~]$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONTs $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform. The collapse of international scientific device and consumable supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for distributed manufacturing of molecular research tools to mitigate the impact of increased pricing to RLSs. To address these challenges, we have developed the ""DIYNAFLUOR"" (DIY Nucleic Acid FLUORometer), a portable, open-source, <$40 USD NA fluorometer, designed using readily available off-the-shelf components, simple 3D-printed parts, and plug-and-play, solder-free assembly. The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an  in-assay Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/L, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/L across a 0-10 ng/L working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology. Device verification was performed by comparative measurements with a Qubit 4 fluorometer in a busy biotechnology laboratory, and build instructions were validated through assembly and qualification of three DIYNAFLUOR devices by researchers outside the primary design team. We also describe a custom ""extreme""low-cost assay, <13{cents} USD per-measurement, that uses SYBR Safe dye to quantify DNA across a working range of 0-0.5 ng/L. This assay reports a lower sensitivity and accuracy than commercial kits but may be of use to RLSs in times of extreme resource constraints or as a teaching tool for STEM educators. To demonstrate its practical application for field-based eDNA analysis in RLSs, the DIYNAFLUOR was used to perform all quality control measurements throughout the preparation of a 16S and 18S metabarcoding library generated from eDNA extracted from Australian lake water, leading to the successful identification of Australian fauna via Nanopore sequencing. Finally, configurations of the DIYNAFLUOR for RNA and Protein quantification are briefly described.

While transcriptional regulation by PER is well established, the role of circadian feedback in co- and post-transcriptional processes remains unclear. Here, we used Nanopore long-read direct RNA sequencing (dRNAseq) and quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to uncover a critical function of PERs in alternative splicing (AS) regulation in the liver. Our expanded long-read transcriptome revealed significant changes in rhythmic expression of annotated transcripts, novel isoforms of known genes, and previously unannotated genes, with widespread perturbations in Per1-/-;Per2-/- (PerKO) livers. Rhythmic AS events were restricted to a distinct subset of transcripts, and splicing entropy - a metric of AS complexity - displayed oscillations in only a limited number of pathways, primarily those associated with glucose homeostasis and cellular responses to insulin. In PerKO livers, however, we detected increased isoform complexity and altered splicing entropy across a broad range of pathways linked to cell growth, morphogenesis, ER-associated degradation (ERAD), insulin response and histone methylation. Biochemical analyses and qMS data indicate that these changes are not due to mis-expression of splicing factors, but rather stem from altered nuclear abundance and chromatin retention of a few Serine-Arginine-rich splicing factors (SRSFs). In particular, SRSF3 acts proximal to the core-clock by defining both the period and amplitude of cellular rhythms. Our findings highlight a critical role for PER proteins in shaping the circadian liver proteome by integrating rhythmic transcription with the regulation of a complex and dynamic splicing landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

We find that this domain adopts an extended RRM (eRRM1) featuring a canonical RRM with a structured N-terminal extension (Next) motif that docks against the RRM and extends the {beta}-sheet surface. The adjoining loop positions the Next for docking to the RRM and forms a tryptophan cage motif, which has only been reported previously in a synthetic peptide. Using a combination of mutagenesis, solution NMR spectroscopy, and thermal denaturation studies we evaluate the importance of residues in the Next-RRM interface and adjoining loop on eRRM folding and conformational dynamics. We find that these sites are essential for protein solubility, thermal stability, and conformational ordering. Consistent with their importance, mutations in the Next-RRM interface and loop are associated with several cancers in a survey of somatic mutations in cancer studies.

Using multimodal neuroimaging data from thirty subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, we simulate the impact of serotonin 2A receptor activation, characteristic of psychedelics, on cortical dynamics. By modulating the excitability of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, our models reproduce hallmark changes in EEG power spectra observed under psychedelics, including alpha power suppression and gamma power enhancement. These spectral shifts are shown to correlate strongly with the regional distribution of serotonin 2A receptors. Furthermore, simulated EEG reveals increased complexity and entropy, suggesting restored network function.

The emergence of single-cell multi-omics technologies has driven the development of several methods that integrate transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data to infer GRNs. While these methods provide examples of their utility in discovering new regulatory interactions, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating their mechanistic and predictive properties as well as their ability to recover known interactions is lacking. To address this, we built a comprehensive framework, Gene Regulatory nETwork Analysis (GRETA), available as a Snakemake pipeline, that includes state of the art methods decomposing their different steps in a modular manner. With it, we found that the GRNs were highly sensitive to methods choices, such as changes in random seeds, or replacing steps in the inference pipelines, as well as whether they use paired or unpaired multimodal data. Although the obtained networks performed moderately well in predictive evaluation tasks and partially recovered known interactions, they struggled to capture causal relationships from perturbation assays. Our work brings attention to the challenges of inferring GRNs from single-cell omics, offers guidelines, and presents a flexible framework for developing and testing new approaches.

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species.

Our analyses identified a recurring previously unreported intronic SVA_E retrotransposon insertion within ASPA in all eight individuals. Surprisingly, the frequency of this variant in population databases suggests it is the most common pathogenic variant in ASPA and should be evaluated in diagnostic testing and carrier screening for CD. Additionally, this finding has implications for the broader rare disease community, as it highlights a substantial blind spot in standard short-read diagnostic pipelines, which historically have missed or overlooked these types of insertions.

Here, we identify substantia nigra DANs with Annexin A1 (Anxa1) expression as selectively vulnerable across multiple prodromal PD models and significantly reduced in patient-derived DANs. We found that Anxa1+ DANs have a unique functional profile, as they do not signal reward or reinforce actions, and they are not necessary for motivated behavior. Instead, activity of Anxa1+ DAN axons correlates with vigorous movements during self-paced exploration, yet their silencing only disrupts a subset of action sequences that mirror a PD bradykinesia profile. Importantly, Anxa1+ DANs are essential for procedural learning in a maze task and for motor learning of dexterous actions. These findings establish the early vulnerability of Anxa1+ DANs in PD, whose function can explain prodromal bradykinesia and impairments in procedural motor learning.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561949

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures. The increasingly higher nominal resolutions (i.e. smaller voxel volumes and dimensions) employed in image acquisition were shown to correspond to real gains in resolution using image reconstruction methods developed to minimize blurring. Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains. The results provide a preview of the potential that will be available in the new era of greater than 10 Tesla human functional imaging, particularly for mesoscale functional organizations and connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

These latter mechanisms are mediated by defence systems, including DNA-degrading systems such as Restriction- Modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, as well as abortive infection systems that induce cell death or dormancy. Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance. However, the regulation, interactions, and ecological roles of these systems in native hosts remain poorly understood. This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements. These findings underscore the need for further studies to investigate the regulation and ecological roles of bacterial defence systems in their native host contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) isolate genes and their regulatory elements within the same topological neighborhood, avoiding crosstalk between regulatory elements. Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF. Our results emphasize the importance of protein combination and abundance to support boundary strength and propose ZNF316 as a novel architectural protein.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

High-resolution analysis of actin cytoskeleton organization disclosed the generation of tension-bearing, circumferential actomyosin bundles in the endothelial cortex that drive EC deformation and vessel constriction.

Accordingly, using language involves an interplay between unimodal brain areas that process sensory information and transmodal areas that respond to linguistic input regardless of the input modality (e.g., reading sentences vs. listening to speech). Previous work has shown that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC), when performed within individuals, can delineate a distributed language network that overlaps in detail with regions activated by a reading task. The network was widely distributed across multiple brain regions, recapitulating an organization that is characteristic of association cortex, and which suggests that the distributed language network serves transmodal, not unimodal, functions. Here, we tested whether the distributed language network encapsulates transmodal functions by assessing its degree of overlap with two language tasks, one auditory (i.e., listening to speech) and one visual (i.e., reading sentences). The results show that the distributed language network aligns well with regions activated by both tasks, supporting a transmodal function. Further, the boundaries of the distributed language network along the lateral temporal cortex serve as a good proxy for the division between transmodal language and auditory functions: presentation of sounds (i.e., filtered, incomprehensible speech) evoked activity that was largely outside of the distributed language network but closely followed the network boundaries. These findings support that individualized iFC estimates can delineate the division between sensory-linked and abstract linguistic functions. We conclude that within-individual iFC may be viable for language mapping in individuals with aphasia who cannot perform language tasks in the scanner.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

However, no current computational model explains V4 responses under natural conditions. To address this, we developed a new hierarchical convolutional energy (HCE) model reflecting computations thought to occur in areas V1, V2, and V4, but which consists entirely of simple- and complex-like units like those found in V1. In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

However, expanding the microbial genome catalogue of soils and sediments has been challenging due to the enormous complexity of these environments. Here, we performed deep, long-read Nanopore sequencing of 154 soil and sediment samples collected across Denmark and through an optimised bioinformatics pipeline, we recovered genomes of 15,314 novel microbial species, including 4,757 high-quality genomes. The recovered microbial genomes span 1,086 novel genera and provide the first high-quality reference genomes for 612 previously known genera, expanding the phylogenetic diversity of the prokaryotic tree of life by 8 %. The long-read assemblies also enabled the recovery of thousands of complete rRNA operons, biosynthetic gene clusters and CRISPR-Cas systems, all of which were underrepresented and highly fragmented in previous terrestrial genome catalogues. Furthermore, the incorporation of the recovered MAGs into public genome databases significantly improved species-level classification rates for soil and sediment metagenomic datasets, thereby enhancing terrestrial microbiome characterization. With this study, we demonstrate that long-read sequencing and optimised bioinformatics, allows cost-effective recovery of high-quality microbial genomes from highly complex ecosystems, which remain the largest untapped source of biodiversity for expanding genome databases and filling in the gaps of the tree of life.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

The systemic administration of opioid agonists makes it both very difficult to decipher their underlying circuit mechanisms of action and to limit drug action to specific receptor subpopulations to isolate therapeutic effects from adverse side effects. Here we design, synthesize, and characterize a reversibly photoswitchable morphinan agonist termed azo-morphine-3 (AM-3) which interconverts from low to high efficacy in response to different wavelengths of light to enable optical control of MOR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of the low efficacy trans and high efficacy cis states of AM-3 bound to the MOR reveal distinct binding modes of the photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, each inducing unique structural dynamics, providing insight into the molecular basis of agonist efficacy.

This form of regulation is enabled by voltage sensing domains (VSDs) that respond to transmembrane voltage differences by changing their conformation and exerting force on the pore to open or close it. Here we use cryogenic electron microscopy to study the neuronal Kv2.1 channel in lipid vesicles with and without a voltage difference across the membrane. Hyperpolarizing voltage differences displace the positively charged S4 helix in the voltage sensor by one helical turn (~5 [A]). When this displacement occurs, the S4 helix changes its contact with the pore at two different interfaces. When these changes are observed in fewer than four voltage sensors the pore remains open, but when they are observed in all four voltage sensors the pore constricts. The constriction occurs because the S4 helix, as it displaces inward, squeezes the right-handed helical bundle of pore lining S6 helices. A similar conformational change occurs upon hyperpolarization of the EAG1 channel. Therefore, while Kv2.1 and EAG1 are from distinct architectural classes of voltage-dependent ion channels, called domain-swapped and nondomain-swapped, the manner in which the voltage sensors gate their pores is very similar.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

Loss of quorum sensing (QS) via mutation of the master regulator, lasR, is a common adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during chronic infections. Here, we use experimental evolution in host-mimicking media to show that loss of QS is constrained by environmental factors associated with host inflammation. Specifically, environments combining oxidative stress and abundant free amino acids limited loss of QS, whereas QS loss was rapid in the absence of oxidative stress regardless of amino acids. Under oxidative stress, lasR mutations were contingent upon first decoupling regulation of oxidative stress responses from QS via mutations in the promoter region of the primary catalase, katA, or in the oxidative stress regulator, oxyR, enabling maintenance of oxidative stress tolerance. Together, our findings suggest that host inflammatory responses likely delay the loss of QS whilst colonizers undergo stepwise evolution, first adapting to survive lethal stressors before responding to other nutritional selective drivers that favour loss of QS.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

Recently, core meiotic genes have been identified in the genome of the model brown alga Ectocarpus, but currently lack proper characterization.

Research into natural variation and the evolution of plasticity frequently studies cis-regulatory elements with theory suggesting they are more important evolutionarily than trans-regulatory elements. Genome-wide association studies have supported this idea, observing a predominance of cis-loci affecting plasticity. However, studies in structured populations provide a contrasting image, raising questions about the genetic architecture of natural variation in plasticity. To circumvent potential statistical difficulties present in genome-wide association studies, we mapped loci underlying transcriptomic plasticity in response to salicylic acid using recombinant inbred lines generated from two random Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We detected extensive transgressive segregation in the salicylic acid response, suggesting that plasticity to salicylate in Arabidopsis is polygenic. Most loci (>75%) underlying this variation act in trans, especially for loci influencing plasticity. Trans-acting loci were enriched in genome hotspots, with predominantly small effect sizes distributed across many genes. This could potentially explain their under-discovery in genome-wide association studies. This work reveals a potentially important role for trans-acting loci in plastic expression responses, with implications for understanding plant adaptation to different environments.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

Yet, the co-linearity of codons and amino acids is so commonplace an idea that few even ask how it arose. Readout is done by two distinct sets of proteins, called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (AARS). AARS must enforce the rules first used to assemble themselves. The roots of translation lie in experimentally testing the structural codes that the earliest AARS*tRNA cognate pairs used to recognize both amino acid and RNA substrates. We review here new results on five different facets of that problem. (i) The surfaces of structures coded by opposite strands of the same gene have opposite polarities. The corresponding proteins then fold up ""inside out"" relative to one another. The inversion symmetry of base pairing thus projects into the proteome. That leads in turn to contrasting amino acid and RNA substrate binding modes. (ii) E. coli reproduces in vivo the nested hierarchy of active excerpts we had designed as models--protozymes and urzymes--for ancestral AARS. (iii) A third novel deletion produced in vivo and a new Class II urzyme suggest how to design bidirectional urzyme genes. (iv) Codon middle-base pairing provides a basis to constrain Class I and II AARS family trees. (v) AARS urzymes acylate Class-specific subsets of an RNA library, showing RNA substrate specificity for the first time. Four new phylogenetic routines augment these results to compose a viable platform for experimental study of the origins of genetic coding.

Significance StatementThe origin of genetic coding poses questions distinct from those faced studying the evolution of enzymes since the first cells. Modern enzymes that translate the code range in size from [~]330 to [~]970 amino acids. Ancestral forms cannot have been nearly as complex. Moreover, such primitive enzymes likely could enforce only a much-reduced coding alphabet. Structural and molecular biology data point to a broad sketch of events leading to the code. That research platform will enable us to see how Nature came to store information about the physical chemistry of amino acids in the coding table. That, in turn, allowed searching of a very broad amino acid sequence space. Selection could then learn how to assemble amino acids into functional, reflexive catalysts. Those catalysts had rates and fidelities consistent with bootstrapping the modern coding alphabet. New phylogenetic algorithms need to be developed to fully test that putative sketch experimentally.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

Transcriptional regulation, a crucial aspect of gene regulation, can be represented as a network of interactions between regulators (such as transcription factors) and their target genes. These networks are known as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Several joint dimensionality reduction (JDR) methods and tools for integrating multi-modal data have been developed in recent years. This study presents a new approach to integrate multi-modal data of different dimensions to consider sample-specific GRNs with multi-omics data in ten cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We compare JDR models that include GRNs with those that do not, assessing their association with patient survival. We find that including GRNs can improve associations with patient survival across several cancer types.

However, existing computational methods often struggle to simultaneously disentangle shared and condition-specific transcriptional patterns, particularly in experimental designs with missing data, unmatched cell populations, or complex attribute combinations. To address these challenges, Patches identifies universal transcriptomic features alongside condition-dependent variations in scRNA-seq data. Using conditional subspace learning, Patches enables robust integration, cross-condition prediction, and biologically interpretable representations of gene expression. Unlike prior methods, Patches excels in experimental designs with multiple attributes, such as age, treatment, and temporal dynamics, distinguishing general cellular mechanisms from condition-dependent changes. We applied Patches to both simulated data and real transcriptomic datasets from skin injury models, focusing on the effects of aging and drug treatment. Patches revealed shared wound healing patterns and condition-specific changes in cell behavior and extracellular matrix remodeling. These insights deepen our understanding of tissue repair and can identify potential biomarkers for therapeutic interventions, particularly in contexts where the experimental design is complicated by missing or difficult-to-collect data.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

The periosteum is typically quiescent, but upon fracture, periosteal cells proliferate and contribute to bone fracture repair. The expansion of the periosteum is regulated by gene transcription; however, the molecular mechanisms behind periosteal expansion are unclear. Here, we show that Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) mediate periosteal expansion and periosteal cell proliferation. Bone fracture increases the number of YAP-expressing periosteal cells, and deletion of YAP and TAZ from Osterix (Osx) expressing cells impairs early periosteal expansion. Mechanistically, YAP regulates both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that allow for periosteal expansion. Specifically, we identified Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4) as a cell extrinsic factor regulated by YAP, that rescues the impairment of periosteal expansion upon YAP/TAZ deletion. Together, these data establish YAP mediated transcriptional mechanisms that induce periosteal expansion in the early stages of fracture repair and provide new putative targets for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

AR is activated by androgens, translocating to the nucleus to bind DNA regulatory elements (AREs) and initiate transcription. This process involves coregulatory proteins, pioneer factors like FOXA1, epigenetic modifications, and 3D chromatin interactions. However, the temporal coordination of AR and co-regulatory binding factors, epigenomic modifications, and 3D chromatin dynamics during AR-mediated transcription remains unclear. Results Using a time-course model of androgen stimulation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, we integrated temporal multi-omics datasets into the MOFA+ framework to investigate AR-mediated transcriptional dynamics. Our analyses uncovered a critical role for rapid AR binding at gene promoters in driving nascent transcription of AR target genes. We demonstrated that AR binding is preceded by nucleosome H3K27 acetylation flanking androgen response elements, which are constitutively marked by FOXA1 binding. Notably, we identified a temporal early switch in nascent transcription post-androgen stimulation, from MYC to AR target genes, likely mediated by transient androgen-induced 3D chromatin interactions. Significance These findings reveal that androgen stimulation rapidly reorganizes 3D chromatin structure and differential MYC and AR transcription factor binding to trigger three distinct patterns of temporal epigenome states associated with the establishment of AR-mediated transcription in prostate cancer. These insights advance understanding of AR regulation in prostate cancer and contribute to a deeper understanding of the temporal relationship between MYC and AR transcriptional regulation in hormone-driven cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

In January 2020, PrimalScheme was used to rapidly generate a primer scheme for SARS-CoV-2, with primer pools distributed to researchers from 44 countries to help scale-up genomic surveillance efforts. Overall, these primers were used to generate an estimated 18M genome sequences and the protocols were viewed online ~250K times. To complement PrimalScheme, we have built PrimalScheme Labs, a scheme repository which allows users to find and share primers schemes as well as establishing a set of data standards. Through improvements to the primer design process, including the use of discrete primer clouds, we have expanded the use of amplicon sequencing to include diverse virus species. We demonstrate the utility of this approach through a high diversity pan-genotype Measles virus (MeV) scheme.

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole. We urge high-quality medical care for prison residents affected by long COVID, and decarceration to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of both COVID-19 and other diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1735164561950

Here, we show that Evo, a 7-billion parameter genomic language model, can perform function-guided design that generalizes beyond natural sequences. By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions.

We validate this approach by experimentally testing the activity of generated anti-CRISPR proteins and toxin-antitoxin systems, including de novo genes with no significant homology to any natural protein. Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions.

We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation.

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi- and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts.

Antibodies that target the rabies glycoprotein (G) are being developed as post-exposure prophylactics, but mutations in G can render such antibodies ineffective. Here, we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to measure how all single amino-acid mutations to G affect cell entry and neutralization by a panel of antibodies. These measurements identify sites critical for rabies Gs function, and define constrained regions that are attractive epitopes for clinical antibodies, including at the apex and base of the protein. We provide complete maps of escape mutations for eight monoclonal antibodies, including some in clinical use or development. Escape mutations for most antibodies are present in some natural rabies strains. Overall, this work provides comprehensive information on the functional and antigenic effects of G mutations that can help inform development of stabilized vaccine antigens and antibodies that are resilient to rabies genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load. Our findings emphasize the role of genomics in informing conservation management and policy.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of [~]40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype- specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches. We believe this new resource provides a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

A popular method to generate surrogate maps with preserved spatial autocorrelation is the spin test.

These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates. We then confirm that targeted removal of individual spins with high distortion reduces false positive rates.

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture. As a proof of concept, we developed two novel whole-genome amplicon panels for M. tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Applying our amplicon panels to clinical samples, we show the ability to classify pathogen subgroups and to reliably identify markers of drug resistance without culturing. Development of this work in clinical settings has the potential to dramatically reduce the time of diagnosis of drug resistance for multiple drugs in parallel, enabling earlier intervention for high priority pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post-translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

However, size affects the dynamics, and, outside a range of robust morphogenesis, the precision of anterior-posterior (AP) axial elongation. Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition. Very small aggregates have increased neural fate bias, accompanied by a loss of paraxial mesoderm mediated by differences in Nodal signalling activity.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 {micro}m, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH,ftsZ,UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB,and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g.,UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown.

In Stage 1 of the project, a list of potential trustworthiness checks was created. The checks on this list must be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

MethodsWe attempted to apply 72 trustworthiness checks to RCTs in 50 Cochrane Reviews. For each, we recorded whether the check was passed, failed or possibly failed, or whether it was not feasible to complete the check. Following application of the checks, we recorded whether we had concerns about the authenticity of each RCT. We repeated each meta-analysis after removing RCTs flagged by each check, and again after removing RCTs where we had concerns about authenticity, to estimate the impact of trustworthiness assessment. Trustworthiness assessments were compared to Risk of Bias and GRADE assessments in the reviews.

Results95 RCTs were assessed. Following application of the checks, assessors had some or serious concerns about the authenticity of 25% and 6% of the RCTs, respectively. Removing RCTs with either some or serious concerns resulted in 22% of meta-analyses having no remaining RCTs. However, many checks proved difficult to understand or implement, which may have led to unwarranted scepticism in some instances. Furthermore, we restricted assessment to meta-analyses with no more than 5 RCTs, which will distort the impact on results. No relationship was identified between trustworthiness assessment and Risk of Bias or GRADE.

ConclusionsThis study supports the case for routine trustworthiness assessment in systematic reviews, as problematic studies do not appear to be flagged by Risk of Bias assessment. The study produced evidence on the feasibility and impact of trustworthiness checks. These results will be used, in conjunction with those from a subsequent Delphi process, to determine which checks should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

Plain language summarySystematic reviews collate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to find out whether health interventions are safe and effective. However, it is now recognised that the findings of some RCTs are not genuine, and some of these studies appear to have been fabricated. Various checks for these ""problematic"" RCTs have been proposed, but it is necessary to evaluate these checks to find out which are useful and which are feasible. We applied a comprehensive list of ""trustworthiness checks"" to 95 RCTs in 50 systematic reviews to learn more about them, and to see how often performing the checks would lead us to classify RCTs as being potentially inauthentic. We found that applying the checks led to concerns about the authenticity of around 1 in 3 RCTs. However, we found that many of the checks were difficult to perform and could have been misinterpreted. This might have led us to be overly sceptical in some cases. The findings from this study will be used, alongside other evidence, to decide which of these checks should be performed routinely to try to identify problematic RCTs, to stop them from being mistaken for genuine studies and potentially being used to inform healthcare decisions.

What is newO_LIAn extensive list of potential checks for assessing study trustworthiness was assessed via an application to 95 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in 50 Cochrane Reviews.
C_LIO_LIFollowing application of the checks, assessors had concerns about the authenticity of 32% of the RCTs.
C_LIO_LIIf these RCTs were excluded, 22% of meta-analyses would have no remaining RCTs.
C_LIO_LIHowever, the study showed that some checks were frequently infeasible, and others could be easily misunderstood or misinterpreted.
C_LIO_LIThe study restricted assessment to meta-analyses including five or fewer RCTs, which might distort the impact of applying the checks.

The functional implications of this expansion and diversification on the conserved role of EXO70 as a subunit of the octameric exocyst complex have remained unresolved. We previously demonstrated barley (Hordeum vulgare) EXO70FX12, a member of the monocot-specific EXO70FX clade, is required for resistance to wheat stripe rust in conjunction with the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) HvPUR1. Through phylogenetic analysis, we identified unique features of the EXO70FX clade, leading us to hypothesize that this clade experienced neofunctionalization. Using structural predictions and protein-protein interaction assays, we demonstrate that HvEXO70FX12 lost the ability to serve as a subunit within the exocyst complex. We predict that the EXO70FX clade has largely lost exocyst association and represents a novel acquisition that emerged during Poales diversification for immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

However, repetitive sequences and complex structural variation pose significant challenges for large-scale characterization. Here, we introduce a method using Oxford Nanopore ultra-long sequencing and adaptive sampling, coupled with a bioinformatic pipeline, to generate haplotype-resolved single-contig IGH assemblies. We compared our method to a well-established IGH characterization framework using Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing in four donors and observed almost complete sequence congruence between our haplotype-resolved assemblies and the HiFi reads. Applying our approach to the HG002 reference material revealed no base differences to the Telomere-to-Telomere genome benchmark over the IGH locus. Importantly, among the four donors, our approach uncovered 30 novel alleles and previously uncharacterized large structural variants, including a 120 kb segmental duplication spanning IGHE to IGHA1 and an expanded seven-copy IGHV3-23 gene haplotype.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950

Initially discovered in flaviviruses, xrRNAs have since been identified in wide range of RNA viruses, including those that infect plants. High sequence variability among viral xrRNAs raises questions about the shared molecular features that characterize this functional RNA class. Here, we present the first structure of a plant-virus xrRNA in its active exoribonuclease-resistant conformation. The xrRNA forms a 9 base pair pseudoknot that creates a knot-like topology similar to that of flavivirus xrRNAs, despite lacking sequence similarity. Biophysical assays confirm a compact pseudoknot structure in solution, and functional studies validate its relevance both in vitro and during infection. Our study reveals how viral RNAs achieve a common functional outcome through highly divergent sequences and identifies the knot-like topology as a defining feature of xrRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1735164561950
