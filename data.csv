YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1749334137089

It remains unclear how the limited set of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) and other proteins activated by these cytokine receptors can encode the observed diversity of immune cell phenotypes. To understand how signaling downstream of cytokines control immune cell phenotype, we sought to map the structure of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling domains to cell signaling and resulting CAR T cell function. We recombined 14 signaling motifs to construct a library of ~30,000 constitutively active synthetic cytokine receptors (SCRs) with intracellular domains composed of novel signaling motif combinations that activate different signaling cascades. We experimentally tested ~450 SCRs which generated a range of CAR T cell memory, cytotoxicity, and proliferation. SCRs with pSTAT1 and 3 signaling generated effector memory CAR T cells, while SCRs with strong pSTAT5 generated effector CAR T cells with potent anti-tumor activity. To map the structure-signaling-phenotype landscape we trained models to predict signaling and CAR T cell phenotype that result from varied motif combinations. From neural network predictions we identified features, including strong STAT5 and Shc signaling, that promote unsafe autonomous CAR T cell proliferation. Models also revealed a trade-off between memory and cytotoxicity, with a Pareto front encoded by a continuous change in signaling. These results demonstrate that recombination of a limited set of signaling motifs creates a continuous spectrum of signaling that encodes a corresponding spectrum of cell phenotype. This work synthetically expands the combinatorial space of JAK/STAT signaling and provides a foundation for rational design of CAR T cells with improved cytotoxicity, memory, and safety profiles.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

While allelic pleiotropy describes variant effects on both local and distal genes or a mixture of molecular effects on a single gene, here we specifically investigate allelic expression ""proxitropy"": where a single variant influences the expression of multiple, neighboring genes. We introduce a multi-gene eQTL mapping framework - cis-principal component expression QTL (cis-pc eQTL or pcQTL) - to identify variants associated with shared axes of expression variation across a cluster of neighboring genes. We perform pcQTL mapping in 13 GTEx human tissues and discover novel loci undetected by single-gene approaches. In total, we identify an average of 1396 pcQTLs/tissue, 27% of which were not discovered by single-gene methods. These novel pcQTL colocalized with an additional 142 GWAS trait-associated variants and increased the number of colocalizations by 34% over single-gene QTL mapping. These findings highlight that moving beyond single-gene-at-a-time approaches toward multi-gene methods can offer a more comprehensive view of gene regulation and complex trait-associated variation.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

Many centromeres comprise highly variable, megabase-scale satellite DNA arrays, yet the mutation spectrum driving this variability remains poorly understood. Using replicated genome assemblies of six Arabidopsis mutation accumulation lines, we identified centromeric mutations consisting almost exclusively of point mutations and structure-preserving, in-frame indels spanning a few kilobases. Centromeric point mutations occurred at a ninefold higher rate (6.1x10-8/bp/gen) than in chromosome arms, frequently introduced by non-allelic gene conversions from closely linked repeat units. Forward-in-time simulations based on the observed mutation spectrum recapitulated the emergence of megabase-scale higher-order repeat (HOR) structures, including long-range sequence similarities, without requiring large-scale rearrangements, closely mirroring centromeric divergence among natural genomes. Our results show that centromere evolution is driven by a unique mutational spectrum, providing a quantitative framework to understand how small-scale mutations shape and maintain the large-scale architecture of centromeric DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

Recent research underscores the importance of root-exuded coumarins in modulating the root microbiome community structure and facilitating iron uptake. However, interactions between root-associated fungi and coumarins in plant iron nutrition remain unknown. We investigated the mechanism by which a fungal endophyte, Macrophomina phaseolina (F80), enhances Arabidopsis iron nutrition. Fungal-coumarin interactions were assessed by profiling metabolites and measuring iron mobilisation in F80 cultures supplemented with specific coumarins, alongside quantifying growth performance and iron content in Arabidopsis coumarin-biosynthesis mutants inoculated with F80. Our findings reveal that an interaction between the coumarin scopoletin and F80 in the rhizosphere rescues plant growth under iron-limiting conditions by resolving the iron mobility bottleneck. F80 exhibits a capacity to modify scopoletin into iron-chelating catechol coumarin esculetin, thereby releasing available iron. We conclude that Arabidopsis-produced scopoletin functions as a precursor for fungal conversion into iron-chelating coumarins. By extending the role of coumarins from bacterial to fungal members of the root microbiota, this study places coumarins at the centre of commensal-mediated enhancement of plant iron nutrition across microbial kingdoms.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

In this work, we introduce pangenome-aware DeepVariant, a variant caller that uses a pangenome reference alongside sample-specific read alignments. It generates pileup images of both reads and pangenome haplotypes near potential variants and uses a Convolutional Neural Network to infer genotypes. This approach allows directly using a pangenome for distinguishing true variant signals from sequencing or alignment noise. We assessed its performance on various short-read sequencing platforms and read mappers. Across all settings, pangenome-aware DeepVariant outperformed the linear-reference-based DeepVariant, reducing errors by up to 25.5%. We also show that Element reads with pangenome-aware DeepVariant can achieve 23.6% more accurate variant calling performance compared to existing methods.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

To better understand the progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as ""early"" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), ""middling"" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and ""advanced"" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of microscopically observed morphologic changes.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

Here, we compared the identified motor unit (MU) discharge patterns from decomposed electromyography signals acquired during triangular dorsiflexion contractions up to 70% of maximal voluntary force (MVF) between resistance-trained, endurance-trained, and untrained individuals (n=23 in each group). We then estimated intrinsic motoneuron properties and garnered insight about the proportion of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs contributing to motor commands across contraction intensities in each group. Participants also performed a task where a triangular contraction was superimposed onto a sustained one designed to challenge inhibitory control of dendritic persistent inward currents (PICs). Both trained groups demonstrated greater MU discharge rates with greater ascending discharge rate modulation during higher contraction forces ([&ge;]50% MVF), which were accompanied by more linear MU discharge patterns and greater post-acceleration attenuation slopes of the ascending discharge rates. No differences in discharge rate hysteresis or the discharge rate characteristics during the sombrero tasks between groups, suggesting no differences in neuromodulatory input. Conversely, resistance- compared to endurance-trained individuals exhibited greater acceleration slopes during lower contractions forces ([&le;]50% MVF), indicating the possibility of enhanced initial activation of PICs. Collectively, the greater and more linear MU discharge patterns in the trained groups either suggests a more reciprocal (i.e., push-pull) excitation-inhibition coupling during higher contraction forces or enhanced excitatory synaptic input to the motor pool, which might underpin greater force production of trained individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

Unfortunately, OSK(M) induces dangerous pluripotency pathways, making it unsuitable for therapeutic use. Recent work has focused on minimising the danger of the cocktail, but safety concerns remain. Here we present ""SB000"", the first single gene intervention to rejuvenate cells from multiple germ layers with efficacy rivalling the Yamanaka factors. Cells rejuvenated by SB000 retain their somatic identity, without evidence of pluripotency or loss of function. These results reveal that decoupling pluripotency from cell rejuvenation does not remove the ability to rejuvenate multiple cell types. This discovery paves the way for cell rejuvenation therapeutics that can be broadly applied across age-driven diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137089

Cultured cells under physical confinement have been shown to experience mechanical stress due to deformation of the nucleus. Nuclear deformation can lead to loss of nuclear integrity and DNA damage, and it has been proposed to underlie cancer initiation and progression. In vivo, the consequences of physical confinement on physiological, developmental cell migration remain so far unexplored. Here, we use the zebrafish neural crest as an in vivo model to address how multipotent embryonic cells respond to physical confinement during developmental migration. By measuring the extracellular space from head to tail along the embryonic body axis, we found that the level of tissue scale confinement increases along the antero-posterior axis. We found that neural crest experience dramatic nuclear deformation during their migrating between adjacent tissues, which quantitatively scales with tissue confinement. By using complementary genetic and mechanical strategies to ablate the surrounding tissue, we observe a rescue of nuclear deformation in vivo. Surprisingly, we found that while deformation of the NC nucleus causes stretching of the nuclear envelope, it does not cause DNA damage even upon extreme deformations. Instead, cells adapt, by decreasing both their DNA damage and LaminB2 levels upon entering confined spaces. In summary, we establish the neural crest as a physiological framework uncovering a dynamic adaptation to tissue confinement in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Here, we present OriGene, a self-evolving multi-agent system that functions as a virtual disease biologist, systematically identifying original and mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets at scale. OriGene coordinates specialized agents that reason over diverse modalities, including genetic data, protein networks, pharmacological profiles, clinical records, and literature evidence, to generate and prioritize target discovery hypotheses. Through a self-evolving framework, OriGene continuously integrates human and experimental feedback to iteratively refine its core thinking templates, tool composition, and analytical protocols, thereby enhancing both accuracy and adaptability over time. To comprehensively evaluate its performance, we established TRQA, a benchmark comprising over 1,900 expert-level question-answer pairs spanning a wide range of diseases and target classes. OriGene consistently outperforms human experts, leading research agents, and state-of-the-art large language models in accuracy, recall, and robustness, particularly under conditions of data sparsity or noise. Critically, OriGene nominated previously underexplored therapeutic targets for liver (GPR160) and colorectal cancer (ARG2), which demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patient-derived organoid and tumor fragment models mirroring human clinical exposures. These findings demonstrate OriGene's potential as a scalable and adaptive platform for AI-driven discovery of mechanistically grounded therapeutic targets, offering a new paradigm to accelerate drug development.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

While plasma-derived EVs have been explored as biomarkers in MS, little is known about EVs in CNS tissue. Here, we characterize EVs from postmortem white matter (WM) of MS and control brains. EVs were separated by differential centrifugation followed by size exclusion chromatography and characterized using nanoflow cytometry, single-particle reflectance imaging sensing (SP-IRIS), and transmission electron microscopy. EV size, yield, and morphology did not differ significantly between MS and control samples. Proteomic analyses revealed downregulation of synaptic and mitochondrial proteins and upregulation of complement and inflammatory proteins and pathways in MS WM EVs. This suggests that EVs reflect ongoing synaptic pathology, metabolic dysfunction, and CNS-compartmentalized inflammation and that they may actively contribute to these pathological processes. Deconvolution analyses suggests a shift in EV cellular origin, with an increased astrocytic and decreased neuronal EV contributions in MS. Several proteomic changes we observed in CNS-derived EVs have also been reported in circulating EVs of people with MS, establishing this CNS tissue EV study as a valuable resource for identifying biomarker candidates for brain-derived plasma EV studies.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Some antibiotics have the potential to mediate interference competition by triggering a bacterial stress response that subsequently activates endogenous viruses integrated in bacterial genomes (prophages). Canonically, this activation is regulated by the SOS response upon DNA damage. Here we show that a metabolite produced by natural isolates of Vibrio ordalii circumvents the SOS response by directly triggering prophage induction in other Vibrio species, co-occurring in the same environment. While the metabolite was previously classified as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, we observe how it acts as a peptide deformylase inhibitor that specifically induces certain prophages, even when target bacterial cells carry multiple other prophages. Its biosynthetic gene cluster, or ord cluster, also encodes its own peptide deformylase (OrdE) which provides self-immunity to producer strains. Likewise, among natural Vibrio isolates that carry similar prophages, resistance against the ord metabolite was found in those that had acquired a divergent second peptide deformylase. Finally, we show that prophage induction by the ord cluster prevents slower-growing producer strains from being outcompeted by their otherwise fast-growing competitors if they carry an inducible prophage. Thus, we demonstrate how natural products play additional impactful roles in communities beyond antibiotic activity and that prophage induction serves as an interference competition strategy, sustaining community diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Here, we show that dendritic inhibition terminates plateaus in an all-or-none manner. Plateaus were initially resistant to inhibition but became increasingly susceptible to termination as they progressed. Between two distinct subtypes of dendrite-targeting interneurons, OLMNdnf generated slower postsynaptic currents that terminated plateaus more effectively than OLM2. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) were necessary for plateaus, which were prolonged by blocking small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK). A single-compartment model with these two conductances recapitulated core experimental findings and provided a mechanistic explanation for terminations. Plateaus arose from VGCCs maintained in the active state by sustained Ca2+ influx, a positive feedback loop that was quasi-balanced by ISK. Inhibition terminated plateaus by driving the membrane potential below a dynamic threshold to deactivate VGCCs and end the positive feedback loop. Lastly, two-photon Ca2+ imaging showed that plateaus evoke large dendritic Ca2+ transients that were graded by terminations. Overall, our results demonstrate how the feedback inhibitory circuit interacts with intrinsic cellular mechanisms to regulate plateau potentials and shape dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA1-PYRs.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

In Azotobacter vinelandii and many other members of Proteobacteria, the two-component system NifL-NifA controls the expression of nif genes that encode the nitrogen fixation machinery. The NifL-NifA system evolved the ability to integrate several environmental cues, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon availability. The nitrogen fixation machinery is thereby only activated under strictly favorable conditions, enabling diazotrophs to thrive in competitive environments. Whilst genetic and biochemical studies have enlightened our understanding of how NifL represses NifA, the molecular basis of NifA sequestration by NifL depends on structural information on their interaction. Here, we present mechanistic insights into how nitrogen fixation is regulated by combining biochemical and genetic approaches with a low-resolution cryo-EM map of the oxidized NifL-NifA complex. Our findings define the interaction surface between NifL and NifA and reveal how this interaction can be manipulated to generate bacterial strains with increased nitrogen fixation rates able to secrete surplus nitrogen outside the cell, a crucial step in engineering improved nitrogen delivery to crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Here, we report the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein persistence in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 replication in otherwise healthy individuals, a set of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and a case of a 60-year-old man who developed a new onset of lupus nephritis seven months following mild COVID-19 disease. We have identified that N protein persistence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) did not correlate with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood but is associated with significantly increased secretion of type I interferons (IFN) and presence of tubuloreticular structures in peripheral leukocytes. We further demonstrate that the N protein colocalizes in the mitochondrial fraction of PBMCs from individuals positive for N protein alongside mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). In vitro expression of the N protein in a monocytic cell line showed that the N protein itself was directly capable of interacting with MAVS in the absence of viral RNA, and this interaction was enhanced if the cell was exposed to oxidative stress. We show that the type I IFN signature in the presence of N protein expression was MAVS, but not STING signaling pathway-dependent. Our findings suggest a mechanism for the onset and promotion of type I IFN signature after COVID-19; in our model, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein can independently trigger sustained type I IFN production via direct activation of MAVS and its spontaneous oligomerization. This long-lasting type I IFN generation may create a chronic inflammatory milieu, favoring autoimmunity with SLE-like symptoms in susceptible individuals.

Yet, despite their conserved function, many bacteria encode multiple PDFs, a genomic feature whose prevalence and implications remain largely unexplored. Here, we reveal that nearly half of all bacterial genomes carry more than one PDF gene, frequently embedded within mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and integrons. In Vibrio cholerae, the accessory PDF (Def2VCH) confers reduced susceptibility to actinonin (ACT), the most studied PDF inhibitor, while still supporting bacterial growth in absence of the canonical PDF copies (Def1VCH). Crystallographic analysis shows that this reduced susceptibility stems from an arginine-to-tyrosine substitution that probably reduces ACT binding. Strikingly, this resistance signature is shared by integron-encoded PDFs, and transfer of an integron-encoded PDF cassette from Pseudoxanthomonas into a susceptible V. cholerae is sufficient to abolish ACT susceptibility. These findings expose a cryptic reservoir of resistance within the bacterial mobilome and highlight a challenge to the therapeutic potential of PDF-targeting antibiotics: resistance may not only emerge, but is already encoded, mobile, and ready to spread.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Despite its popularity, the PR task hinges on a low-dimensional behavioral readout -- breakpoint, or the maximum work requirement subjects are willing to complete before abandoning the task. Here, we show that with a simple modification, the PR task can be transformed into an optimization problem reminiscent of the patch-leaving foraging scenario, which has been analyzed extensively by behavioral ecologists, psychologists, and neuroscientists. In the Progressive Ratio with Reset (PRR) task, rats perform the PR task on one lever, but can press a second lever to reset the current ratio requirement back to its lowest value at the cost of enduring a reset delay, during which both levers are retracted. Rats used the reset lever adaptively on the PRR task, and their ratio reset decisions were sensitive to the cost of the reset delay. We derived an approach for computing the optimal bout length -- the number of rewards to earn before pressing the reset lever that produces the greatest long-term rate of reward -- and found that rats flexibly changed their behavior to approximate the optimal strategy. However, rats showed a systematic bias for bout lengths that exceeded the optimal length, an effect reminiscent of ""overharvesting"" in patch-leaving tasks. The PRR task thus represents a novel means of testing whether and how rats adapt their behavior to the cost-benefit structure of the environment in a way that connects deeply to the broader literature on associative learning and optimal foraging theory.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Yet the cognition driving this dynamic--and its broader implications--remains poorly understood. Here, we show that nest-building zebra finches follow a copy-if-dissatisfied strategy, but only when social information aligns with recent experience: after observing a conspecific build a nest, males were more likely to choose the demonstrated 'social' material--particularly on their first choice--if they had previously used low-quality material. Using Bayesian cognitive modelling, we estimated how latent learning mechanisms underpinned males' material choices, identifying two asocial and two social governing parameters. These parameters provide the first formal evidence for the cognitive basis of birds' nest building. Forward simulations informed--but not prescripted--by these parameters approximated observed material-choice trajectories, supporting their causal role. Additional simulations targeting simplified real-world contexts showed that payoff structure--not (dis)satisfaction--drove social material choice, though higher rewards did not proportionally boost its use, offering preliminary insights into the mechanisms underlying material-use variation more broadly. Our study illustrates how computational modelling can robustly link behaviour to underlying learning mechanisms and probe the generalisability of animal cognition--a rarity in this field.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

This is partly due to a historical view of females occupying a passive role compared with males, which led to ignoring female song even in some well-studied species. We report one such case in yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia), as no other study investigated female song in 35 years after the first documentation of solo female songs. We interrogate the seasonal patterns and functions of female song in Galapagos yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia aureola), in which females perform solo song and produce duets with their male social partners. We carried out simulated territory intrusions by broadcasting male, female, or duet songs during breeding and non-breeding seasons, and conducted a territory retention survey for over a year. We measured the association between aggressive response and singing behaviour, sex-specific patterns of response, and territory retention across years. Females sang mostly during the non-breeding season and predominantly in male-led duets. Although females were strongly aggressive towards female song playback, they gave the weakest singing response towards them. There was no association between female aggressive behaviour and song output in response to a simulated intruder. Moreover, the probability of territory retention across years was not explained by song output or aggression in response to intruders, though evidence for this was weak due to the small sample size. We suggest that female song in this year-round resident island system does not function for territory defense or intrasexual competition, but may have other functions.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

PTHrP has been clinically implicated as a putative regulator of cachexia, with serum PTHrP levels correlating with increased weight loss in PDAC patients. Here we show that cachectic PDAC patients have high expression of tumor PTHrP and use a genetically engineered mouse model to functionally demonstrate that deletion of Pthlh (encoding the PTHrP protein) blocks cachectic wasting, dramatically extending overall survival. The re-expression of PTHrP in lowly cachectic models is sufficient to induce wasting and reduce survival in mice, which is reversed by the conditional deletion of the PTHrP receptor, Pth1r, in adipocytes. Mechanistically, tumor-derived PTHrP suppresses de novo lipogenesis in adipocytes, leading to a molecular rewiring of adipose depots to promote wasting in the cachectic state. Finally, the pharmacological disruption of the PTHrP-PTH1R signaling axis abrogates wasting, highlighting that a targeted disruption of tumor-adipose crosstalk is an effective means to limit cachexia.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

To identify how social circuits are re-organized by stress, we interrogated the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH), a key node for both the orchestration of emotionally-relevant behavior and the integration of sensory information. Using a footshock-based model of traumatic stress, we established that a single exposure to a series of unpredictable, inescapable footshocks was sufficient to negatively alter social behavior, resulting in increased violence and social hesitancy. Critically, we found that stress-induced changes to social behavior engaged neural ensembles in the VH, a critical node in the regulation of emotion states. Using a virally-mediated, activity-dependent cellular tagging approach to label two neural ensembles activated by temporally distinct experiences, we were surprised to find that stress-induced violence and stress-induced social hesitancy recruited largely non-overlapping populations of cells in the VH, in contrast to higher degrees of ensemble overlap in unstressed control mice, suggesting that stress biases the brain towards stronger differentiation of distinct social states. Additionally, we found that activity of VH neurons was required for stress-induced aggression. Finally, we found that stress-induced changes to social behaviors and VH activity profiles could be reversed by the introduction of social buffering post-stress. Collectively, our findings suggest that stress drives the VH to dissociably encode specific behavioral states, rather than a single state of negative valence, consistent with a role for multiple structures and distributed ensembles in the modulation of traumatic stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Here, we introduce ElectraON and ElectraOFF, a pair of green fluorescent eFRET-based GEVIs engineered by incorporating a photostability-enhanced derivative of the bright monomeric fluorescent protein mBaoJin with Ace opsin variants. Critically, Electras demonstrate over 6-fold improved photostability compared to state-of-the-art eFRET GEVIs, pAce, and Ace-mNeon2, under one-photon illumination, while characterized by bright green fluorescence, millisecond kinetics, and good membrane localization. This enhanced stability translates to a 3-to >10-fold extension in functional recording duration, maintaining reliable spike detection in both cultured neurons in vitro and sparsely labeled neurons in the awake mouse cortex in vivo. We demonstrated sustained in vivo recordings exceeding 30 minutes, with instances surpassing one hour. Furthermore, Electras show functionality under scanless two-photon excitation in cultured cells.

However, targeting specific cellular features within large, complex organs remains challenging. Here we present a series of technical improvements significantly enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of the Serial Lift-Out and SOLIST (Serialized On-grid Lift-In Sectioning for Tomography) procedures that are revolutionizing the field. We were able to extend the cryo-FIBSEM session from 24 hours to 5 days without interruptions. In addition, we describe a modified silver-plated EasyLiftTM needle that eliminates the need of the copper or gold block between the original tungsten needle and the sample. Moreover, we describe a strategy that significantly reduces curtaining effects. Finally, we report a precise routine to target a lamella with a precision of approximately 1 {micro}m in X,Y and Z. Together, these modifications considerably reduce contamination risk and preparation time, making cryo-lift-out techniques more accessible for routine structural biology applications on any type of tissue. Here, we demonstrate the power of our technique by targeting several specific wall structures that are of crucial importance for root function in plants and that were previously inaccessible to cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). High-pressure freezing (HPF) of plant tissues presents unique challenges for cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation due to the overall sample size, the individual cells size, their rigid cell wall and finally, their large vacuoles, which contain large amounts of rather diluted water solutions compared to cytosol. The internal root structures targeted are the Casparian strip (CS), suberin lamellae (SL), as well as secondary wall of xylem vessels, requiring reaching a targeting precision of 5 m in a 3 mm long and 80-120 m thick root tip. Our technological improvements for the cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) workflow enabled successful, targeted cryo-ET in plant roots. We noticed that, despite ice formation in vacuoles and to some degree in the cytosol, the plasma membranes and cell walls are remarkably well preserved, providing stunning insights into the native, hydrated nano-structure of plant cell walls, previously only observable with contrasting agents and in a dehydrated state.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

These experiments are currently conducted by thousands of high school students and can offer an unprecedented window into biofilm adaptation while building a community of young researchers. Providing high school students access to research experiences improves learning and can have positive and long-lasting impacts on their attitudes towards science. Moreover, student research can make impactful scientific contributions. Through EvolvingSTEM, students evolve populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in a biofilm bead model and observe heritable changes in colony morphology. Genome sequencing of 70 mutants that they picked identified parallel mutations in genes known to regulate biofilm growth (wsp, yfiBNR, morA, fuzY). We also uncovered novel adaptations: loss-of-function mutations in phosphodiesterase PFLU0185 that did not alter colony morphology, and mutations affecting periplasmic disulfide bond formation producing small colonies. PFLU0185 mutations consistently reached high frequencies and phenotyping revealed roles in cyclic di-GMP regulation, biofilm formation, and motility, prompting us to name this gene bmo (biofilm and motility optimizer). Competition experiments and microscopy demonstrated bmo mutants employ generalist strategies and coexist with the ancestor and specialist mutants through niche differentiation. Consequently, phenotypic diversity is maintained, with smooth (ancestral and bmo) colonies consistently outnumbering wrinkly and fuzzy variants. The study advances understanding of biofilm genetic architecture while demonstrating that student-led research can uncover mechanisms of microbial adaptation relevant to Pseudomonas infection biology and provide transformative STEM experiences. IMPORTANCE: Bacterial biofilms dominate microbial life, yet their evolutionary genetics remain incompletely understood. This science education project engages thousands of high school students in experimental evolution, yielding discoveries about biofilm adaptation while transforming their science education. Selected mutants included PFLU0185/bmo, a conserved phosphodiesterase that helps bacteria balance the competing demands of attachment and dispersal essential for biofilm life cycle success. The finding that smooth-colony generalists rather than conspicuous variants dominate biofilm adaptation adds to our understanding of the process of niche differentiation in biofilms. This work also demonstrates the power of distributed research networks for discovery of new genetic pathways of adaptation. Students gained authentic research experience, potentially inspiring them to join the next generation of scientists, while identifying mutants adapted to discrete conditions that maintain diversity within biofilms. This synergy between education and discovery offers a scalable model for addressing complex biological questions while developing scientific literacy in diverse classrooms.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

The complex domestication history of G. hirsutum combined with reciprocal introgression with a second domesticated species, G. barbadense, has generated a wealth of morphological forms and feral derivatives of both species and their interspecies recombinants, which collectively are scattered across a large geographic range in arid regions of the Caribbean basin. Here we assessed genetic diversity within and among populations from two Caribbean islands, Puerto Rico (n = 43, five sites) and Guadeloupe (n = 25, one site), which contain putative wild and/or introgressed forms. Using whole-genome resequencing data and a phylogenomic framework derived from a broader genomic survey, we parsed individuals into feral derivatives and truly wild forms. Feral cottons display uneven levels of genetic and morphological resemblance to domesticated cottons, with diverse patterns of genetic variation and heterozygosity. These patterns are inferred to reflect a complex history of interspecific and intraspecific gene flow that is spatially highly variable in its effects. Wild cottons in both Caribbean islands appear to be relatively inbred, especially the Guadeloupe samples. Our results highlight the dynamics of population demographics in relictual wild cottons that experienced profound genetic bottlenecks associated with repeated habitat destruction superimposed on a natural ecogeographical distribution comprising widely scattered populations. These results have implications for conservation and utilization of wild diversity in G. hirsutum.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

The cellular lineages and transcriptional programs underlying this process remain poorly understood in cnidarians. Combining reporter tracing and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify adult neurogenic trajectories in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We uncover two distinct mechanisms: direct differentiation of peptidergic neurons from a multipotent progenitor pool, with identities specified proportionally to existing populations, and a stepwise maturation of cnidocytes (specialized cnidarian neural cells), marked by a transcriptionally distinct intermediate stage. Neural fate commitment is characterized by transient SoxC expression, with a homeodomain code associated with neural identities. These modular strategies support continuous neurogenesis and suggest that neural fate specification may use ancestral principles shared with bilaterians. Our study provides a foundational framework for understanding the mechanisms underlying the adult specification of neural cells and their evolutionary diversification across animal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

TDP-43 is a nucleic acid-binding protein involved in transcriptional repression, mRNA splicing, and the regulation of retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). RTEs and ERVs are mobile genetic elements that constitute about 45% of our genome. These virus-like elements encode the capacity to replicate through an RNA intermediate and insert cDNA copies at de novo chromosomal locations. Their expression is a proven source of DNA damage and inflammatory signaling. Research in Drosophila has demonstrated a causal role of RTEs/ERVs in mediating both intracellular toxicity of TDP-43 and the intercellular spread of these toxic effects from glia to neurons. RTEs and ERVs are inappropriately expressed in postmortem tissues from ALS, FTD, and Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients, as well as in cell culture in response to TDP-43 disruption, suggesting that the findings in Drosophila may be conserved across species. But the role of RTEs and ERVs has not yet been examined in a vertebrate model of TDP-43 pathology. To investigate the functional contributions of RTEs in vertebrates, we utilized an established transgenic mouse model that overexpresses moderate levels of either human wild-type TDP-43 (hTDP-43-WT) or a mutant version with a specific causal amino acid substitution (hTDP-43-Q331K) associated with some inherited forms of the disease. Through RNA-sequencing of the motor cortex, and imaging of a LINE-1-EGFP retrotransposon indicator cassette, we found that the TDP-43 transgenic animals exhibit broad expression of RTEs and ERVs, along with replication of LINE-1 in glia and neurons in the motor cortex. This expression begins at the age of onset of neurological phenotypes, earlier in the hTDP-43-Q331K animals and much later in hTDP-43-WT. Although the motor defects progressively worsen over time, the LINE-1-EGFP replication reporter transiently labels spatially clustered groups of neurons and glia at the time of onset of motor symptoms. These EGFP-labeled neurons undergo cell death and are therefore lost over time. Unlabeled cells also die as a function of distance from the clusters of LINE-1-EGFP labeled neurons and glial cells. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology triggers RTE/ERV expression in the motor cortex, that such expression marks cells for programmed cell death, with non-cell autonomous effects on nearby neurons and glial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Maximum Likelihood (ML) based phylogenetic inference tools search for the tree and evolutionary model that best explain the observed genomic data. Given the independence of likelihood score calculations between different genomic sites, parallel computation is commonly deployed. This is followed by a parallel summation over the per-site scores to obtain the overall likelihood score of the tree. However, basic arithmetic operations on IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, such as addition and multiplication, inherently introduce rounding errors. Consequently, the order by which floating-point operations are executed affects the exact resulting likelihood value since these operations are not associative. Moreover, parallel reduction algorithms in numerical codes re-associate operations as a function of the core count and cluster network topology, inducing different round-off errors. These low-level deviations can cause heuristic searches to diverge and induce high-level result discrepancies (e.g., yield topologically distinct phylogenies). This effect has also been observed in multiple scientific fields, beyond phylogenetics.

ResultsWe observe that varying the degree of parallelism results in diverging phylogenetic tree searches (high level results) for over 31% out of 10 130 empirical datasets. More importantly, 8% of these diverging datasets yield trees that are statistically significantly worse than the best known ML tree for the dataset (AU-test, p < 0.05). To alleviate this, we develop a variant of the widely used phylogenetic inference tool RAxML-NG, which does yield bit-reproducible results under varying core-counts, with a slowdown of only 0 to 12.7% (median 0.8%) on up to 768 cores. We further introduce the ReproRed reduction algorithm, which yields bit-identical results under varying core-counts, by maintaining a fixed operation order that is independent of the communication pattern. ReproRed is thus applicable to all associative reduction operations - in contrast to competitors, which are confined to summation. Our ReproRed reduction algorithm only exchanges the theoretical minimum number of messages, overlaps communication with computation, and utilizes fast base-cases for local reductions. ReproRed is able to all-reduce (via a subsequent broadcast) 4.1 x 106 operands across 48 to 768 cores in 19.7 to 48.61 {micro}s, thereby exhibiting a slowdown of 13 to 93% over a non-reproducible all-reduce algorithm. ReproRed outperforms the state-of-the-art reproducible all-reduction algorithm ReproBLAS (offers summation only) beyond 10 000 elements per core. In summary, we re-assess non-reproducibility in parallel phylogenetic inference, present the first bit-reproducible parallel phylogenetic inference tool, as well as introduce a general algorithm and open-source code for conducting reproducible associative parallel reduction operations.

Specifically, maternally derived steroids in egg yolks have been shown to influence morphological development in avian offspring, but the effect of most yolk steroid hormones and their metabolites on embryonic growth and development remain poorly explored. We tested relationships between eggshell maculation, surface temperature, hormone concentrations before and during incubation, and embryonic growth in Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs developing while artificially incubated in duplicate incubators. We detected 10 steroid hormones in the yolks during development and concentrations of all hormones declined to Day 15 (~2 days before hatch). Steroid declines at Day 9 of incubation were related to eggshell surface temperature, with warmer eggs having higher concentrations of androgens and progestogens, and incubator assignment, as eggs were warmer on average in one incubator than the other. However, eggshell surface temperature was not related to eggshell maculation, embryonic size, or embryonic heart rate during development. These results provide evidence of yolk steroid concentration declines through incubation and suggest that environmental conditions (such as temperature or light) could alter embryonic hormone uptake and/or metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

The Southern Ocean is among the regions where these impacts are particularly pronounced. Phytoplankton, which perform the bulk of primary production, both maintain the Antarctic marine food web and contribute to the role of the Southern Ocean as the largest oceanic sink for atmospheric CO2. Previous observational and modeling studies have revealed certain drivers-phytoplankton relationships and highlighted the important confounding factors. In this study, we quantified how climate and environmental drivers interact and influence phytoplankton biomass over a 20-year period, across the entire Southern Ocean, within a multi-factor framework. Specifically, we examined the relationships among atmospheric CO2, surface water pH, sea ice concentration, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, dissolved iron concentration, and chlorophyll a concentration. To perform this analysis, we introduced and applied two novel methodological approaches. Firstly, to address seasonal autocorrelation, we combined seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (STL) with piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM). This approach allowed for robust estimation of long-term driver magnitudes and causal pathways, even in the presence of limited sample sizes and complex data structures. Secondly, given the highly interconnected nature of environmental drivers, we employed a data-driven SEM approach to objectively identify causal structures and avoid biases associated with a priori pathway selection. Our results show a clear signal of ocean acidification driven by increasing CO2, iron limitation of phytoplankton biomass during spring, and seasonal differences in both the magnitude and structure of the causal pathways, demonstrating the dynamic nature of seasonal processes in the Southern Ocean. This study presents the first Southern Ocean-wide, multi-factor assessment of climate and environmental impacts on phytoplankton biomass over a two-decade period. It introduces a methodological framework mitigates seasonal autocorrelation to accurately capture long-term seasonal trends, and demonstrates the utility of data-driven causal discovery in resolving complex ecological interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

However, the timing and nature of neuronal changes, differences between neuronal subtypes, and their coordination with glia remain unclear. Here, we used non-negative matrix factorization to identify co-expression gene programs in single-nucleus RNA profiles from the prefrontal cortex of 437 samples from donors whose clinical symptoms ranged between no cognitive impairment and AD dementia.

We found neurons in AD undergo rapid modulation of synaptic genes, accompanied by convergence of neurons into two distinct programs: An oxidative stress and apoptosis program abundant in vulnerable neuronal subtypes, and a DNA damage and cell-cycle reentry program associated with resilient subtypes. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming was closely tied to glial responses, and diverged between AD to non-AD brain aging, suggesting neuro-glial coordinated reprogramming shapes the AD cascade and influences disease outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

As cells differentiate collectively, it raises the question of how tissue-level properties affect instructive cues of decision-making. Here, we show that a tissue rigidity phase transition guides patterning by tuning the length-scales and time-scales of morphogen signalling. By combining rigidity percolation theory, reaction-diffusion modelling, quantitative imaging, optogenetics and single-cell transcriptomics in zebrafish, we uncover dynamical global tissue rigidity patterns that actively shape the Nodal morphogen gradient by restricting ligand dispersal and accelerating its signalling activity. In this self-generated mechanism, Nodal, besides driving meso-endoderm fate specification, increases cell-cell adhesion strength via regulating planar cell polarity genes. Once adhesion strength reaches a critical point, it triggers a rigidity transition which collapses tissue porosity. The abrupt tissue reorganisation negatively feeds back on Nodal signalling impacting both its length-scales, by limiting Nodal diffusivity, and its time-scales, by speeding up the expression of its antagonist Lefty, thereby ensuring timely signal termination and robust patterning. Overall, we reveal how emergent properties set the spatiotemporal dynamics of morphogen gradients, uncovering macroscopic mechanisms of pattern formation.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Through computational structural analysis we established putative MoAs for 21 uncharacterised ADPs. We demonstrate the utility of EVADES by exploring three hypotheses and demonstrate that: (i) ADPs acting as DNA mimics exhibit broad-spectrum activity against defences; (ii) protein sharing across defence systems enables multi-defence inhibitory activity of ADPs; and (iii) eukaryotic dsDNA viruses encode ADP homologs, suggesting conserved immune evasion strategies across domains.

While animals use mobile immune cells to eliminate pathogens, plants rely on localized cells in contact with the pathogen to detect and mount immune responses. Although bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled the assessment of plant responses to pathogen infection at the whole transcriptome level, the spatial coordination of plant immune responses remains elusive. In this study, we performed both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomic experiments to capture the spatial pattern of soybean plant responses to Asian soybean rust infection caused by the pathogen Phakopsora pachyrhizi. Through the analysis of both spatial and single-nuclei transcriptomics data, we identified two distinct host cell states with specific spatial localization in response to pathogen infection: the infected regions with the presence of the pathogen and the surrounding regions bordering the infected regions. Importantly, the surrounding regions exhibited higher expression of defense response-related genes than the infected regions, despite having minimal presence of the pathogen, indicating a cell non-autonomous defense response in the surrounding regions. Additionally, gene co-expression network analysis with single-cell resolution identified a key immune response-related gene module activated in the stressed cells captured in our single-nuclei RNA-seq data. This study reveals the intricate spatial coordination of plant defense responses against pathogen infection and enhances our understanding of the importance of localized cell non-autonomous defense responses in plant-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

The classical view holds that cells translate a constant concentration of a GF with specific chemical identity to a steady state activation of the underlying signaling pathway, resulting in a defined phenotypic response. However, recent findings suggest that even a single GF, when presented in a pulsatile manner, drives differential phenotypic responses depending on the frequency of stimulation. To reconcile these views, we introduce a novel conceptual framework of ""signaling homeorhesis"". Unlike homeostasis, homeorhesis describes the stable evolution of signaling trajectories over time. Defining this concept quantitatively using a dynamical systems framework, we use mathematical models of the Epidermal Factor Growth Receptor (EGFR) and the Tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) networks, as well as available experimental temporal protein activity recordings in PC-12 cells to demonstrate that cells classify GF signals to unique signaling trajectories that encode for distinct cell phenotypes, irrespective of the GF identity. We thereby propose that the cellular phenotype is determined in real-time, as the cell actively interprets the growth factor signals from its environment.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

However, the richness of such data means that conventional analyses may only scratch its surface. Extracting meaningful insights from these datasets often requires advanced computational methods and domain expertise. Current AI agents for biology are primarily focused on executing user-specified commands and are therefore limited by the users creativity and familiarity with which kinds of analyses are useful. Furthermore, these agents do not account for prior analyses already attempted by researchers, reducing their ability to build upon existing work. To address these limitations, we introduce CellVoyager, an AI agent that autonomously explores scRNA-seq datasets in novel directions conditioned on prior user-ran analyses. Built on large language models, CellVoyager ingests both the dataset and a record of prior analyses to generate and test new hypotheses within a Jupyter notebook environment. We evaluate CellVoyager on CellBench, a new benchmark based on 50 published scRNA-seq studies encompassing 483 analyses. Given only the background sections of these papers, CellVoyager outperformed GPT-4o and o3-mini by up to 20% in predicting which analyses the authors eventually conducted. We then carried out three in-depth case studies where CellVoyager is given previously published papers with their scRNA-seq datasets and conducts analyses to generate new findings. The original authors of each study evaluated these findings and consistently rated them as creative and sound; 80% of the agents hypotheses were deemed scientifically interesting. For example, in one case study, the agent found that CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 infection are more primed for pyroptosis, which was not explored by the original researchers. CellVoyager also reanalyzed a brain aging dataset to discover a previously unreported association between increased transcriptional noise and aging in the subventricular zone of the brain. These results demonstrate that CellVoyager can act both autonomously and collaboratively to accelerate hypothesis generation and computational biology. It also highlights the potential of agents like CellVoyager to unlock new biological insights by reanalyzing the vast existing biological data at scale.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Pig body weight values estimated by a conventional approach or a computer vision system can be considered as two different measurements of the same trait, but with different sources of phenotyping error. Previous studies have shown that trait measurement error, defined as the difference between manually collected phenotypes and image-derived phenotypes, can be influenced by genetics, suggesting that the error is systematic rather than random and is more likely to lead to misleading quantitative genetic analysis results. Therefore, we investigated the effect of trait measurement error on genetic analysis of pig body weight (BW).

ResultsCalibrated scale-based and image-based BW showed high coefficients of determination and goodness of fit. Genomic heritability estimates for scale-based and image-based BW were mostly identical across growth periods. Genomic heritability estimates for trait measurement error were consistently negligible, regardless of the choice of computer vision algorithm. In addition, genome-wide association analysis revealed no overlap between the top markers identified for scale-based BW and those associated with trait measurement error. Overall, the deep learning-based regressions outperformed the adaptive thresholding segmentation methods.

ConclusionsThis study showed that manually measured scale-based and image-based BW phenotypes yielded the same quantitative genetic results. We found no evidence that BW trait measurement error could be influenced, at least in part, by genetic factors. This suggests that trait measurement error in pig BW does not contain systematic errors that could bias downstream genetic analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Therefore, attentional impairments may serve as early indicators of cognitive decline, and also as meaningful targets for therapeutic intervention. Despite their clinical importance, attention deficits remain under-targeted by current treatments, which offer only modest benefit. To support development of more effective therapies, preclinical models that closely mirror human neurobiology and behavior are essential. Non-human primates (NHPs), with their high degree of cortical and functional similarity to humans, particularly in prefrontal regions, offer a uniquely translational platform for evaluating cognitive enhancers. We assessed pharmacological interventions targeting sustained attention using the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in adult male cynomolgus macaques. Monkeys were trained to detect target stimuli while ignoring distractors, achieving individualized stable performance. To simulate cholinergic dysfunction, we administered scopolamine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, which produced dose-dependent declines in accuracy and reaction time. Mild and severe impairment levels were identified within each animal. We then tested three compounds: nicotine, guanfacine, and donepezil. Nicotine, a nicotinic receptor agonist, fully restored performance across both impairment levels, suggesting potential benefit in both early and advanced AD. Guanfacine, an 2A adrenergic agonist, improved accuracy only under mild impairment, while donepezil, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, showed inconsistent effects. None of the compounds reversed scopolamine-induced slowing of reaction time, indicating specificity for attentional control. These findings highlight the utility of the NHP CPT as a pharmacologically sensitive model for detecting attentional dysfunction and evaluating pro-cognitive therapeutics in aging and neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Here, we examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal circuits - regions implicated in forming cognitive maps - also support the abstraction of emotional experiences. Using functional MRI data collected as participants viewed emotionally evocative film clips, we found that activity in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex predicted self-reported emotion across schematically distinct videos, consistent with a role in structural learning. Computational modeling of emotion transitions revealed that hippocampal responses to films and emotion self-reports could be predicted based on the statistical regularities of emotion transitions across different temporal scales. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal-prefrontal systems represent emotion concepts at multiple levels of abstraction, offering new insight into how the brain organizes emotion knowledge.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

This study applied a gradient-based approach to examine macroscale cortical organization in FND. Methods: We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 64 patients with mixed FND (FND-mixed), 61 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs), and 62 psychiatric controls (PCs) matched on age, sex, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity. Functional connectivity gradients were computed to capture dominant axes of cortical organization. Between-group comparisons were conducted for the top three gradients, and associations with symptom severity were investigated. Subtype-specific patterns in functional motor disorder (n=49) and functional seizure (n=24) were also examined. Analyses controlled for age, sex, and antidepressant use, and were post-hoc adjusted for depression, anxiety, and PTSD-severity, and for childhood maltreatment. Results: The FND-mixed group showed alterations across all three gradients relative to HCs and PCs. Gradient 1 revealed increased values in sensorimotor regions, reflecting a shift toward more association-like connectivity. Gradient 2 showed altered differentiation between sensory systems. Gradient 3 exhibited reduced functional separation between representational and modulatory regions, with prominent shifts in the anterior cingulate cortex. Several regions displaying between-group differences also showed correlations with FND and somatic symptom severity. Analyses revealed overlapping and distinct patterns across subtypes. Conclusions: We provide novel evidence of atypical hierarchical brain organization in FND, highlighting gradient-based approaches for identifying mechanistically-relevant altered functional brain organization.","NA","medrxiv",1749334137090

Spatiotemporally controlled expression of mutant GNAQQ209L from the endogenous locus induced choroidal nevi with limited penetrance. Concomitant BAP1 deletion enhanced nevus formation, while further MYC activation led to fully penetrant intraocular tumors with metastatic potential.

Trajectory analyses inferred dedifferentiation from the Melanocytic toward the Neural Crest-like state during tumor progression. Comparison to human UM revealed commonalities with highly aggressive Class 2 UM, including gene expression signatures and copy number gains affecting genes that map to human chromosome 8q beyond the activated MYC allele, suggesting cooperative effects of multiple drivers in this chromosomal region.

Here we describe the genome-wide identification and functional analysis of the terpene synthase (TPS) family that governs terpene chemical diversity in strawberries. Mining of the allo-octoploid genome of the cultivar Royal Royce identified 75 TPS gene candidates. Biochemical characterization of 27 predicted mono-, sesqui- and di-TPS enzymes via in vitro activity assays and in vivo enzyme co-expression studies demonstrated a range of TPS activities that are relevant for the biosynthesis of two thirds of known strawberry terpenes as well as products not previously described in octoploid strawberry. Complementary metabolomic and transcriptomic studies across a diversity panel of strawberry accessions demonstrated substantial variation in the composition and abundance of more than 30 detected accession-specific and common terpene aromas, nine of which matching characterized TPS products. Analysis of a developmental time series of two accessions with contrasting aroma further revealed accession-specific alterations of terpene metabolism during fruit ripening.

Although pasteurisation was shown to effectively inactivate influenza viruses in milk, unpasteurised milk still poses a risk of infection, both from occupational exposure in dairies and from the consumption of raw milk. We therefore assessed how long influenza viruses could remain infectious for in milk without heat inactivation. We examined the stability of a panel of influenza viruses in milk, including a contemporary H5N1 HPAIV and a variety of other influenza A and D viruses.

Following an isolated report of H5N1 viral RNA being detected in milk from a sheep in the UK, we also carried out similar experiments with a laboratory strain of IAV in sheeps milk. Although the survival of influenza viruses in milk was variable, we consistently found that under laboratory conditions substantial viral infectivity remained over periods when people might reasonably be exposed to infected milk - for over a day at room temperature and for more than 7 days when refrigerated.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Central to their energy metabolism is a membrane-bound, sodium-translocating methyltransferase complex: the N-tetrahydromethanopterin:CoM-S-methyltransferase (Mtr complex), which catalyzes the methyl transfer between two methanogen specific cofactors. This exergonic methyl transfer step is coupled with a vectorial sodium ion transport from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior and is the only energy conserving step in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Here, we present a 2.1 [A] single-particle cryo-EM structure of the full Mtr complex from Methanosarcina mazei. Our structural model encompasses the entire complex, reveals the arrangement of archaeal phospholipids, the architecture of the sodium ion binding site, and the structure and interactions of all catalytic subunits. Most strikingly, we discover and characterize MtrI, a previously unannotated small open reading frame (small ORF), encoded protein (<100 aa) conserved across the order of Methanosarcinales. MtrI binds to the cytoplasmic domain of MtrA in response to oxygen exposure, suggesting a role in oxygen stress response and protection. By binding on top of the sodium channel and anchoring to the cobamide cofactor in MtrAs cytoplasmic domain, MtrI might prevent sodium leakage and inhibit MtrA-CoM turnover. These findings offer new insights into methanogen energy conservation and uncover a potential adaptive response to oxygen exposure, expanding our understanding of methanogen survival strategies under oxidative stress.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Despite widespread vaccination, infections persist, and the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 reprograms host metabolism remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether virus-induced lipid remodeling is conserved across variants and whether changes in lipid abundance correlate with alterations in lipid biosynthetic enzymes. Using global untargeted lipidomics and quantitative proteomics, we analyzed A549-ACE2 cells infected with the Delta (B.1.617.2) or Omicron (B.1.1.529) variants and compared them to cells infected with the ancestral WA1 strain. In parallel, we conducted quantitative proteomics to assess virus-induced changes in the host proteome. Our results reveal that SARS-CoV-2 drives a remarkably consistent pattern of metabolic rewiring at both the lipidomic and proteomic levels across all three variants. We mapped changes in the expression of host metabolic enzymes and compared these to corresponding shifts in lipid abundance. This integrative analysis identified key host proteins involved in virus-mediated lipid remodeling, including fatty acid synthase (FASN), lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA), and ORM1-like protein 2 (ORMDL2). Together, these findings highlight conserved metabolic dependencies of SARS-CoV-2 variants and underscore host lipid metabolism as a potential target for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

We identified a unique mechanism employed by insect odorant receptors to discriminate amongst pheromones, chemical communication signals that orchestrate courtship and mating behavior. By coupling cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and functional mutagenesis, we find that males of the silkmoth Bombyx mori distinguish between two quasi-identical compounds -bombykol, an alcohol, and bombykal, an aldehyde- by establishing a reversible covalent bond between the pheromone receptor and bombykal. Bombykol, instead, binds to the same receptor through hydrogen bonds, with significantly lower potency. The unique ability of aldehydes to establish a reversible covalent bond allows moths to unequivocally distinguish between compounds that differ only in the presence of a single hydrogen atom. Further, as many important odorants are aldehydes, this work illuminates a new binding mode available to the olfactory system to achieve high selectivity for these compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1749334137090

Surprisingly, the developmental processes underlying gill formation in zebrafish remain poorly understood. Here, we present for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the morphogenesis of gill arteries, filaments and lamellae during lifelong development.

Our results provide important insights into the temporal and spatial pattern of gill angiogenesis, revealing fundamental differences in the formation of lateral versus medial filaments along the dorso-ventral axis. These early asymmetries correlate with, and likely underlie, the structural asymmetries observed in adult gills, which we quantitatively characterize. This indicates that a region-specific developmental programme establishes a blueprint for gill architecture maintained throughout life.

We further show that lamellae develop through a complex interplay between endothelial and cranial neural crest-derived pillar cells. Notably, lamellar size, which strongly influences respiratory efficiency, depends on the position of the filament in the arch. Together, our work identifies key cellular and temporal mechanisms driving gill development and provides a framework to investigate broader principles of branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis in vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

To date, mitigation of these issues has been attempted through calibration or by training bespoke models for specific experimental setups, with only partial success. We here demonstrate that transfer learning can successfully overcome these limitations by leveraging pre-trained model parameters. Remarkably, this approach can even fit highly performant models to substantially different peptide modifications and LC conditions than those on which the model was originally trained. This impressive adaptability of transfer learning makes it a highly robust solution for accurate peptide retention time prediction across a very wide variety of imaginable proteomics workflows.","NA","biorxiv",1749334137090

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1749334137090

TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
