While recent studies indicate that nucleosomes are clustered as condensed chromatin domains in higher eukaryotic cells, how histone H1 mechanically condenses chromatin remains unclear. Here, using a combination of direct visualization of single-H1 molecules in living human cells and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the majority of H1 behaves like a liquid inside chromatin domains, rather than binding stably to nucleosomes as suggested by the traditional model. H1 functions as a liquid-like ''glue'', mediating dynamic multivalent interactions between nucleosomes within chromatin domains. Consistently, rapid-depletion of H1.2 leads to decondensed chromatin domains both in cells and in silico. Our findings suggest that the H1 ''glue'' condenses chromatin domains while keeping them fluid and accessible, thereby supporting essential DNA transactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

The evolutionary association of mobile elements with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with mobile elements lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help overcome these barriers, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration in between bacterial populations favours this linkage when the gene is beneficial in an environment where prophage induction is also upregulated. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages. Here, virion dispersal allows phage-encoded genes to spread into patches of bacteria lacking the gene, giving them a selective advantage over immobile chromosomal genes. While both of these mechanisms are evidently applicable to phages, this is less clear for plasmids and other mobile elements. This helps to resolve the long-standing question of why phages, rather than other mobile genetic elements, appear to frequently carry virulence genes as cargo. By demonstrating how spatial heterogeneity and phage lifecycle dynamics drive gene association, our work provides new insights into the evolution of phage-encoded pathogenicity and bacterial adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Yet to date, the mechanism of HGT among eukaryotes has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that Starships, a newly discovered group of cargo-mobilizing transposable elements, are active vectors of horizontally transferred DNA among eukaryotic species. We find that multiple Starships simultaneously transfer themselves and their cargo within and between fungal genera separated by upwards of 100 million years of evolution. Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of the Hephaestus Starship into a new species increases metal resistance due to the genes carried by this element. Between 18-27% of all Starships in our focal genus, Paecilomyces, have evidence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, including to other fungal genera, revealing Starship-mediated HGT to be a widespread and frequent phenomenon across filamentous fungi. This study identifies the first active genetic mechanism for HGT between eukaryotic species.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Here, we uncover a mechanism for developmental regulation of nuclear migration directionality. The nuclear envelope KASH protein UNC-83 in Caenorhabditis elegans exists in multiple isoforms that differentially control motor activity. The shorter UNC-83c isoform promotes kinesin-1-dependent nuclear movement in embryonic hyp7 precursors, while longer UNC-83a/b isoforms facilitate dynein-mediated nuclear migration in larval P cells. We demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of UNC-83a functions as a kinesin-1 inhibitory module by directly binding kinesin heavy chain (UNC-116). This isoform-specific inhibition, combined with differential affinity for kinesin light chain (KLC-2), establishes a molecular switch for directional control. Together, these interdisciplinary studies reveal how alternative isoforms of cargo adaptors can generate developmental stage-specific regulation of motor activity during development.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

However, there is an ongoing need for novel TCM preparations. The aim of this study was to assess the potential and mechanism of a de novo designed TCM preparation: JinHuangJieDu (JHJD), which is composed of JIN YIN HUA, HUANG QIN, GUANG HUO XIANG, BAI ZHI, PU GONG YING and BO HE, for the treatment of COVID-19 using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro experimental validations. Methods: First, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to validate whether JHJD inhibits the binding of wild type and mutant receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by JHJD was assessed with pseudovirus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and COS7-hACE2 cells. Network pharmacology analysis using Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional Medicine (ETCM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases (TCMSP) were further performed to identify the meridional network, active ingredients and targeted genes of JHJD. Interaction networks were constructed and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were performed using Cytoscape (3.7.1) software with ClueGO and CluePedia plugins. Vital genes were identified using CytoHubba and MCODE plugins. In vitro experiments were performed to confirm one of the targeted crucial gene and to validate whether JHJD may mitigate inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results: JHJD effectively blocked the binding of both wild type and Omicron RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 and completely inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to ACE2-positive host cells in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis uncovered that JHJD comprises a total of 378 active ingredients and 339 targeted genes, with its primary actions likely focused on lung, stomach and spleen. A total of 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, predominantly related to viral infection and inflammation pathways. Two pivotal genes, CCND1 and HIF1A, were identified by intersecting the MCODE module genes with different node algorithms in CytoHubba. In vitro validation confirmed that JHJD could target HIF-1, reducing virus-induced inflammation, which may potentially mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a de novo designed TCM JHJD could effectively inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through blocking of the interaction between RBD and ACE2. The inhibitory effect appears to be particularly potent against Omicron variants, as JHJD demonstrated enhanced efficacy in inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interaction for several Omicron variants. Furthermore, JHJD could mitigate the virus-induced inflammation by targeting HIF-1. Collectively, this study suggested that JHJD preparation holds promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19, as it not only inhibits the viral entry into host cells but also reduces the inflammatory responses triggered by the infection.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

They also represent a complex ecosystem as intricate holobionts made up of microbes from all domains of the Tree of Life, where many play significant roles in host health and fitness [4]. The corallicolids are a clade of apicomplexans that infect a wide variety of anthozoans across the world, and have been shown to influence the thermal tolerance of habitat-forming corals [1, 5]. Despite their potentially important impacts on reef ecosystems, much of the basic biology and ecology of corallicolids remains unclear. Apicomplexans often have a closed life cycle, with minimal environmental exposure, and sometimes multiple hosts. Corallicolids have only been documented in anthozoan hosts, with no known secondary/reservoir hosts or vectors [6]. Here, we show that abundant corallicolid sequences are recovered from bearded fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in tropical reef habitats off Curacao, and that they are distinct from corallicolids infecting the corals on which the fireworms were feeding at the time of their collection. The data are consistent with an active infection of fireworms, as opposed to corallicolids being a byproduct of feeding on infected corals, and we propose that H. carunculata is potentially a vector moving corallicolids between coral hosts through its faeces. These findings not only expand our understanding of the ecological interactions within coral reef ecosystems but also highlight the potential role of host-associated parasites in shaping the resilience of reef habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date. Methods: We conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Findings: Neuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 57.7% (49/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms. Interpretation: Our findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741557974353

In the most extreme case, a gene can be essential for viability in one genetic background, but dispensable in another. Although genetic context-dependency of mutant phenotypes is frequently observed, the underlying causes often remain elusive. Here, we investigated the genetic changes responsible for differences in gene essentiality across 18 genetically diverse natural yeast strains. First, we identified 39 genes that were essential in the laboratory reference strain but not required for viability in at least one other genetic background, suggesting that the natural strain contained suppressor variants that could bypass the need for the essential gene. We then mapped and validated the causal bypass suppressor variants using bulk segregant analysis and allele replacements. Bypass suppression was generally driven by a single modifier gene that tended to differ between genetic backgrounds. The suppressors often indirectly counteracted the effect of deleting the essential gene, for instance by changing the transcriptome of a cell. Context-dependent essential genes and their bypass suppressors were frequently co-mutated across 1,011 yeast isolates and identified naturally occurring evolutionary trajectories. Overall, our results highlight the relatively high frequency of bypass suppression in natural populations, as well as the underlying variants and mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the causes of genetic background effects is crucial for the interpretation of genotype-to-phenotype relationships, including those associated with human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field.

Despite these insights, fundamental questions remain regarding how DRN neurons process sensory information, what do DRN communicate to forebrain, and the role of DRN inputs in forebrain computations and animal behavior.To address these questions, we investigated the spatiotemporal activity patterns of DRN neurons, along with DRN axons and their targets in the juvenile zebrafish forebrain. Our findings revealed a remarkable topographic organization of ongoing activity and sensory-motor responses within the DRN. We discovered that a large fraction of DRN neurons are primarily driven by animals locomotor activity. We also observed that an anterior group of DRN neurons, marked by Gad1, exhibited distinct activity patterns during rest, locomotor activity and sensory stimulation. DRN axons broadly innervating the forebrain exhibit topographically organized excitation and inhibition in response to sensory stimulation and motor activity. Notably, we observed significant and rapid covariation between the activity of DRN axons and nearby forebrain neurons. Chemogenetic ablation of the DRN led to a marked reduction in the synchrony and sensory-motor responses across forebrain neurons, accompanied by significant deficits in adaptive behaviors.

However, concerns remain that increased telehealth availability may contribute to higher overall healthcare utilization and spending. To assess telehealth's impact on outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visit volume, we compared overall E&M utilization before and after the pandemic across specialties with varying levels of telehealth use. Methods: We analyzed 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims to compare monthly outpatient E&M visit rates between two periods: pre-pandemic (January 2019-February 2020) and post-pandemic (January 2021-June 2024). Specialties were categorized by telehealth use as high (behavioral health), medium (primary care), and low (orthopedic surgery). A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to assess changes in visit volume associated with telehealth. Results: Prior to the pandemic, telehealth accounted for just 0.1% of monthly E&M visits but surged to 41.0% in April 2020 before stabilizing between 5.7% and 7.0% in 2023-2024. The average monthly E&M visit rate per 1,000 FFS beneficiaries was 906.8 pre-pandemic and 918.6 post-pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, telehealth comprised 1.2% of E&M visits in low-use specialties, 8.4% in medium-use specialties, and 43.8% in high-use specialties. Compared to the expected trend based on the low telehealth-use specialty, high and medium telehealth-use specialties experienced a 4.1% and 7.2% relative decline in overall E&M visits, respectively, in the post-pandemic period. Conclusion: Following an initial surge, telehealth use stabilized in 2021 and beyond.

ObjectiveThis retrospective cohort study compares the overall spending, rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging procedures within 30 days for Medicare fee-for-service patients who underwent in-person and telehealth evaluations between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022.

DesignA large-scale retrospective cohort study using propensity score matching

SettingPatients with no prior visits and 30-day episodes of care initiated by telehealth or in-person visits from July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022.

ParticipantsThis study included 100% of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries who are aged >65 years while excluding those with Medicare Advantage coverage and those without continuous Medicare Parts A and B.

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741557974353

This flexibility relies on network interactions encompassing premotor and prefrontal regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). However, the dynamic interplay between these regions during action preparation and execution based on contextual demands remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that contextual information is encoded in SMA and rIFG interareal connectivity before action. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) during Go/No-Go tasks with varying target probabilities, we found that, during the preparatory stages of action, -band rIFG connectivity increased in contexts where motor responses were more frequently withheld. In contrast, SMA exhibited a reversed pattern only near the target onset. Finally, {beta}-band connectivity encoded proactive inhibition processes, increasing when action likelihood was low. Accordingly, during response implementation, both areas exhibited greater {beta}-band connectivity when action was withheld compared to when a motor response was required, further supporting its role in inhibitory control. Our results demonstrate that - and {beta}-band oscillatory network dynamics support context-sensitive adaptations, illustrating how premotor and prefrontal regions synergistically modulate their interactions as they transition from preparation to response. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates predictive information to dynamically organize motor and cognitive resources before an action unfolds, revealing that connectivity encodes critical information driving behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

This study reports a novel role of human ERK1 as a DNA endonuclease to catalyze single-strand DNA breaks without sequence-specificity. ERK1 catalysis required magnesium ion and was independent of ATP. Biochemical and structural analyses indicated that the ERK1 N-terminal domain allosterically modulates substrate binding and catalytic rate.

To address these obstacles, we present the DASH assembly toolset, which combines features of Golden Gate-based cloning, recombineering, and site-specific recombinase systems. We developed (1) a set of donor vectors based on the GoldenBraid platform, (2) an acceptor vector derived from the plant transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, and (3) a re-engineered recombineering-ready E. coli strain, CZ105, based on SW105. The initial assembly steps are carried out using the donor vectors following standard GoldenBraid assembly procedures. Importantly, existing parts and transcriptional units created using compatible Golden Gate-based systems can be transferred to the DASH donor vectors using standard single-tube restriction/ligation reactions. The cargo DNA from a DASH donor vector is then efficiently transferred in vivo in E. coli into the acceptor vector by the sequential action of a rhamnose-inducible phage-derived PhiC31 integrase and arabinose-inducible yeast-derived Flippase (FLP) recombinase using CZ105. Furthermore, recombineering-based post-assembly modification, including the removal of undesirable scars, is greatly simplified. To demonstrate the utility of the DASH system, a 116 kb DNA construct harboring a 97 kb cargo consisting of 35 transcriptional units was generated. One of the CDSs in the final assembly was replaced through recombineering, and the in planta functionality of the entire construct was tested in both transient and stable transformants.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Mitochondria and plastids evolved from bacteria and therefore also use prokaryotic-type expression machineries to synthesize proteins. However, fungi and animal mitochondria are highly sensitive to mistranslation, which for instance manifests in lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy disorder. The response in plant cells is unknown. Glutaminyl-transferRNAs (Gln-tRNAGln) of bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids are synthesized indirectly. Initially, tRNAGln gets charged with glutamate. Subsequently, Gln is produced through trans-amidation by the aminoacyl-tRNA amido-transferase complex GatCAB. Consequentially, affected GatCAB activity results in pools of misloaded Glu-tRNAGln. Here we show that Arabidopsis mutants with decreased GatCAB level provide global insights into organellar mistranslation in plants. Proteomics revealed Gln-to-Glu misincorporation in plastid- and mitochondrially-expressed protein complexes with only modest abundance changes in mutant plants. Plastids appear more lenient to mistranslation as they exhibit much higher Gln-to-Glu misincorporation. Through efficient compensatory mechanisms, mutant plants display surprisingly subtle phenotypes. However, their acclimation to temperature stress differs. Interestingly, wild-type plants under similar stress also have altered Gln-to-Glu misincorporation. Our study shows that the response towards organellar mistranslation varies among eukaryotes. In plants, this knowledge can be used to improve stress tolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Previous studies have established that bypass of DPCs by the eukaryotic replicative helicase, CMG complex, is critical for DPC repair. We investigated the mechanism of leading-strand DPC bypass by CMG using purified components. Our results reveal that CMG can bypass DPCs in the presence of downstream single-stranded DNA, without the aid of other replisome factors. DPC bypass is a slow process, and its efficiency depends on the size and structure of the protein barrier. DPC bypass does not require CMG to interact with the excluded strand or to unfold the protein adduct, implying that the CMG helicase ring opens to navigate past a DPC. Furthermore, opening of no single MCM interface is essential for bypass, suggesting a flexible ring opening mechanism. Our work highlights the remarkable versatility of the CMG complex in navigating replication challenges, ensuring proper replication fork progression and preserving genome stability.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Methods: We used weighted data from the YRBS for 2011-2023 (n=110,409). We explored the impact of declining school and student response rates, missing data, and shifts in age distribution in 2021 on reported sexual intercourse. Using statistical decomposition, we estimated the percentage change in this outcome between 2019 and 2021 due to change in the age structure versus changes in reported behavior. Results: From 2011 and 2023, school and student survey response rates declined (school 81% to 40%, student 87% to 71%, and overall, 71% to 35%). Missing data on ever had sex increased over time from 7.0% in 2011 to 29.5% in 2019 and 19.8% in 2023. The age structure in the YRBS national sample was similar from 2011-2019 and in 2023, but substantially younger in 2021. Statistical decomposition estimated that 50% of the change in sexual experience among adolescent women between 2019 and 2021 and 30% of the change for adolescent men was due to a change in the age distribution. Implications: Declining response rates, increased missing data, and changes in the age structure of 2021 YRBS raise serious concerns about the validity of trends in the YRBS. A concerted national effort is needed to build support for the collection of YRBS and other public health surveillance data.","NA","medrxiv",1741557974353

This study investigates the Bermin crater lake species flock in Cameroon, comprising thirteen (nine valid and four undescribed) Coptodon species, to explore the effects of deep-water light environments on visual evolution. We analyzed visual opsin genes and their expression using 109 retina transcriptomes, focusing on differences among species at varying depths, and seasonal changes in the visual system of a seasonally migrating species. All species exhibit a multichromatic system with at least five cone opsins. While opsin sequence variability among species was minimal due to the flock's evolutionary youth, opsin expression patterns varied significantly. Deep-water species showed reduced SWS1 and SWS2B expression, consistent with diminished UV-to-violet light in deeper waters. Unexpectedly, we observed increased proportional expression of the red-sensitive LWS opsin gene, contrary to trends seen in other lacustrine fishes. Additionally, in the seasonally deep-dwelling species Coptodon imbriferna, opsin expression varied plastically between the rainy (shallow) and dry (deep) seasons, with reduced SWS2B expression when the fish reside in the deeper habitats. To add context of other cichlid systems and to explore shared patterns of molecular adaptation, we compared Bermin cichlids to the deep-water species of the Barombi Mbo crater lake. Both cases exemplify independent evolution of deep-water species, yet their visual systems adapted similarly in the single cones (less UV- and violet-sensitive and more blue-sensitive cones), whereas differently in the long-wavelength sensitive double cones (LWS expression lost in Barombi while increased in Bermin). Overall, our study focuses on an evolutionarily young example of cichlid adaptive radiation, providing a unique opportunity to examine the initial phases of molecular adaptation in visual systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Here, we report the development of a dynamic imaging platform coupled with an analytical pipeline that enables us to follow and measure subcellular structures throughout the 48-hour cell cycle of live parasites. We reveal a predetermined sequence of four discrete morphological steps in organelle development, which are tightly correlated with nuclear replication. We show that one of these steps, which we term the Crown morphology, is required for nucleus-apicoplast attachment. During Crown, apicoplast is stretched over multiple nuclei, fastened by centriolar tubulin. A complementary molecular approach was used to discover the basic ploidy of apicoplast and mitochondrial genomes, their replication rates and association with nuclear DNA replication. We inhibited nuclear DNA replication and found that it completely blocks apicoplast biogenesis in its most initial stages, demonstrating dependency on S-phase initiation. Conversely, specific inhibition of apicoplast genome replication resulted in an almost-undisturbed organelle development and division. However, it affected the Crown step, preventing association to tubulin-nuclear structures, leading to failure in accurate organelle sorting into daughter cells. Collectively, these experiments reveal a central cellular pathway linking apicoplast development to the parasite cell cycle, and a second independent organellar mechanism responsible for segregation into daughter cells.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Dedifferentiation, a process in which partially or terminally differentiated cells revert to a stem cell state, has been observed in a wide range of stem cell systems, and it has been implicated in the mechanisms for stem cell maintenance. Dedifferentiated stem cells are morphologically indistinguishable from original stem cells, making them challenging to identify. Therefore, whether dedifferentiated stem cells have any distinguishable characteristics compared with original stem cells is poorly understood. The Drosophila testis provides a well-established model to study dedifferentiation. While our previous live imaging analyses have identified dedifferentiation events constantly occurring at steady state, existing genetic marking methods fail to detect most of the dedifferentiated stem cells and thus significantly underestimate the frequency of dedifferentiation events. Here, we established a genetic tool with improved sensitivity and used live imaging and mathematical modeling to evaluate the system. Our findings indicate that the specificity of lineage-specific promoters is critical for successfully identifying dedifferentiated stem cells.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Here, we present gtePIDP, a computational framework that systematically integrates multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic) to identify Phenotypically Impactful Driver Pathways through dual evaluation of mutation patterns (coverage/exclusivity) and downstream regulatory cascades. Leveraging mutation profiles and expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), combined with transcription factor (TF) and miRNA regulatory networks, we constructed a systems biology model to map somatic alterations to phenotypic outcomes. By iteratively pruning candidate driver genes and quantifying resultant perturbations in gene expression and regulatory activities, gtePIDP prioritizes gene sets that maximize mutational significance and phenotypic impact. Our analysis uncovered pivotal GBM driver pathways involving TP53, CDKN2A, MDM2, and RB1, which disrupt key cancer-associated regulators (e.g., oncogenic: NFATC2, MIR-370; tumor-suppressive: MIR-506, MIR-9, FOXJ2), driving dysregulation of angiogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation.

Relaxed clock models, which accommodate variation in evolutionary rates across branches, are one of the main components of Bayesian dating, yet their consequences for total-evidence phylogenetics have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we combine morphological, molecular (both transcriptomic and Sanger-sequenced), and stratigraphic datasets for all major lineages of echinoids (sea urchins, heart urchins, sand dollars). We then perform total-evidence dated inference under the fossilized birth-death prior, varying two analytical conditions: the choice between autocorrelated and uncorrelated relaxed clocks, which enforce (or not) evolutionary rate inheritance; and the ability to recover ancestor-descendant relationships. Our results show that the latter has no impact on either topology or node ages and highlight a previously unnoticed interaction between the tree and clock models, with analyses implementing an autocorrelated clock precluding the recovery of direct ancestry. On the other hand, tree topology, fossil placement, divergence times, and downstream macroevolutionary inferences (e.g., ancestral state reconstructions) in sea urchins are all strongly affected by the type of relaxed clock implemented. In regions of the tree where molecular rate variation is pervasive and morphological signal relatively uninformative, fossil tips seem to play little to no role in informing divergence times, and instead passively move in and out of clades depending on the ages imposed upon them by molecular data. Our results highlight the extent to which the phylogenetic and macroevolutionary conclusions of total-evidence dated analyses are contingent on the choice of relaxed clock model, highlighting the need for either careful methodological validation or a thorough assessment of sensitivity. Our efforts continue to illuminate the echinoid tree of life, supporting the erection of the order-level clade Apatopygoida to include three living species last sharing a common ancestor with other extant lineages in the Jurassic. Furthermore, they also illustrate how the phylogenetic placement of extinct clades hinges upon the modelling of molecular data, evidencing the extent to which the fossil record remains subservient to phylogenomics.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

In this model, half of the founder NSPCs were ablated using diphtheria toxin A at the onset of neurogenesis, yet the surviving cells regenerated a brain containing all neuronal types within five of the total twenty embryonic days. Analysis of allelic variants revealed overrepresented somatic variants, indicating that only a small fraction of NSPCs underwent significant clonal expansion during early neurogenesis. Modelling proliferation dynamics predicted that as few as 10% of NSPCs could produce 83% of neurons by the time of birth. Single nucleotide substitution analysis suggested a potential link to oxidative metabolism in some of the expanded clones.

Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to investigate the effects of pro-proliferative signaling on epithelial homeostasis using the Drosophila follicle cell lineage. Notably, EGFR-Ras overactivation induces cell cycle defects by activating the transcription factors Pointed and E2f1 and impedes differentiation. Hh signaling simultaneously promotes an undifferentiated state and induces differentiation via activation of EMT-associated transcription factors zfh1 and Mef2. As a result, overactivation of Hh signaling generates a transcriptional hybrid state comparable to epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. Co-overactivation of Hh signaling with EGFR-Ras signaling blocks differentiation and induces key characteristics of tumor cells including a loss of tissue architecture caused by reduced expression of cell adhesion molecules, sustained proliferation and an evasion of cell cycle checkpoints. These findings provide new insight into how non-interacting signaling pathways converge at the transcriptional level to prevent malignant cell behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

We showcase two applications using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. First, we unmixed the highly spectrally overlapping fluorophores mCherry and mKate2 to distinctively track tagged proteins in six-dimensional datasets to investigate cell division in the developing early embryo. Second, we unmixed fluorescence of tagged proteins of interest from masking natural autofluorescence in adult hermaphrodites. For FLIM data handling and workflow implementation, we developed the open-source plugin napari-FLIM-phasor-plotter to implement conversion, visualization, analysis and reuse of FLIM data of different formats.

These individual differences among organisms from the same genotype and reared in identical environments can result in phenotypic variability in the absence of genetic variation. While there is strong evidence to suggest that variability of traits can be heritable and determined by the genotype of an organism, little is known about how selection can specifically shape this heritable variance. Here, we describe a Python-based model of directional artificial selection for increasing the variability of a polygenic trait of interest. Specifically, our model focuses on variability in left-vs-right turn bias in\textit{ D. melanogaster}. While the mean value of turn bias for a genotype is non-heritable and constant across genotypes, the variability of turn bias is a heritable and polygenic trait, varying dramatically among different genetic lines. Using our model, we compare different selection regimes and predict selection dynamics at population and genetic levels. We find that introducing population structure via a family-based selection regime can significantly affect selection response. When selection for increased variability is implemented on the basis of independently measured traits of individuals, the response is slower, but leads to a population with a greater genetic diversity. In contrast, when selection is implemented by measuring traits of families with half or full siblings, the response is faster, albeit with a reduced final genetic diversity in the population. Our model provides a useful starting point to study the effect of different selection regimes on any polygenic trait of interest. We can use this model to predict responses of laboratory-based selection experiments and implement feasible experiments for selection of complex polygenic traits in the lab.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

In this study, olive pomace digestate was biorefined and its components were upcycled into soil amendments and plant immunostimulants. Metagenomic analysis revealed a diverse microbial community in the liquid fraction, including Luteimonas, Pseudomonas, and Caldicoprobacter. We obtained a MIcrobial Protein Extract (MIPE) from digestate, containing precursors of microbe- and damage-associated molecular patterns. Treatment with MIPE triggered a rapid plant immune response, characterized by increased hydrogen peroxide production, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the upregulation of defense-related genes. MIPE-induced priming enhanced Arabidopsis and tomato resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae.

We examine the differences in phylogenetic signal between a continuous trait partition, a discrete trait partition, and a joint analysis with both types of characters. We find that continuous and discrete traits contribute substantially different signal to the analysis, even when other parts of the model (clock and tree) are held constant.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the isochorismate (IC) pathway is the primary route for pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis. First, the IC synthase (ICS) catalyzes the isomerization of chorismate to IC in chloroplasts. Second, the chloroplast-localized MATE transporter EDS5 appears to transport IC from chloroplasts to the cytosol. Cytosolic IC is then further converted to SA via the GH3 amino acid-conjugating enzyme PBS3. While this pathway is genetically well-characterized in A. thaliana, its evolutionary origin and conservation remain controversial. In this study, through comprehensive phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that the IC pathway emerged within the Brassicales order in a time span between the divergence of Carica papaya and Capparis spinosa. The evolution of the IC pathway was driven by three key adaptations during the time span: (1) enhancement of ICS activity, (2) neofunctionalization of EDS5 after duplication of its ancestral gene, and (3) evolution of PBS3, whose activity is specialized for glutamate-conjugation to IC. Structural modeling and functional assays reveal that an enhanced salt bridge network in ICS enhanced its activity. One of the duplicated genes, EDS5, acquired key amino acid substitutions in the C-lobe, which likely contributed to the new function as the IC transporter. In addition, the functional PBS3 clade, including A. thaliana PBS3, is restricted to a Brassicales clade. Taken together, this study addresses the evolutionary trajectory of IC-based SA biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data.

We introduced ProDualNet, a novel approach for designing dual-target protein sequences by integrating sequence-structure information from two distinct receptors. ProDualNet used a heterogeneous graph network for pretraining and combines noise-augmented single-target data with real dual-target data for fine-tuning. This approach addressed the challenge of limited dual-target protein experimental structures. The efficacy of ProDualNet has been validated across multiple test sets, demonstrating better recovery and success rates compared to other multi-state design methods. In silico evaluation of cases like dual-target allosteric binding and non-overlapping interface binding highlights its potential for designing dual-target binding proteins.

The evaluation of stalk mechanics has focused primarily on the end-of-season outcomes and defined differences among inbred and hybrid maize genotypes. However, there is a gap in understanding how these different end-of-season outcomes are achieved. This study measured stalk flexural stiffness in maize inbred genotypes under different fertilizer application strategies and in maize commercial hybrid genotypes under different disease states. Under all conditions, stalk flexural stiffness followed a biphasic trajectory, characterized by a linear increase phase and a sustained phase. Within a genotype, the fertilizer application or disease state altered the rate of increase in the linear phase but did not impact the timing of transition to the sustained phase. Whereas between genotypes, the timing of transition between phases varied. Destructive 3-point bend tests of inbred stalks showed that the trajectory of stalk mechanics is defined by the bending modulus, not the geometry. Together, these results define a biphasic trajectory of maize stalk mechanics that can be modulated by internal and external factors.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Such efforts have primarily been implemented at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), providing data for large resident populations but hindering the ability to implement targeted interventions or follow-ups. Conversely, building-level wastewater data exhibits increased variability due to rapid daily population dynamics but allows for targeted follow-up interventions or mitigation efforts. Here, we implemented a three-site wastewater sampling strategy on our university-affiliated medical campus from May 2021 to March 2024, comprised of two distinct hospital quadrants and a primarily research laboratory and classroom building. We first addressed several limitations in implementing hospital-level wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling frequency and laboratory techniques. We subsequently improved our ability to model SARS-CoV-2 case counts using wastewater data by performing sensitivity analyses on viral shedding assumptions and testing the utility of internal normalization factors for population size. Our unique infrastructure allowed us to detect intra-hospital dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and diversity and confirmed that direct sequencing of wastewater was able to capture corresponding clinical viral diversity. In contrast, research building wastewater sampling showed that for most non-residential settings, despite low overall viral loads, a threshold approach can still be used to identify peaks in cases or transmission amongst the general population. Our study expands on current wastewater surveillance practices by examining the utility of and best practices for upstream and particularly hospital settings, enabling the use of non-municipal, medium-scale wastewater testing to inform efforts for reducing the burden of COVID-19.

ImportanceSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has been increasingly implemented to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most wastewater testing across the United States occurs at municipal wastewater treatment plants. Yet, this testing method could also be beneficial at non-municipal and non-residential sites, including hospitals, where wastewater data for SARS-CoV-2 signals and viral diversity could directly impact hospital practices to control its spread. We analyzed both hospital and non-residential research building wastewater over a three-year period to establish optimized methods for collecting and interpreting wastewater data at sites upstream of treatment plants. We found that even within a single hospital building, wastewater testing in different locations showed distinct signatures over time, which corresponded with data from patients hospitalized in those locations. This study provides a framework for the use of wastewater viral surveillance upstream of municipal treatment plants to enable targeted interventions to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1741557974353

Accordingly, Mpipi-T predicts temperature-driven protein behavior quantitatively in both single- and multi-chain systems. Beyond its predictive capabilities, we demonstrate that Mpipi-T provides a framework for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress responses, offering new insights into how proteins sense and adapt to thermal changes in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

In former Roman territories, their emergence has traditionally been linked to mass migrations from outside the Roman Empire. However, recent studies have emphasised local continuity with some individual-level mobility. We generated and analysed 248 historic genomes from Late Roman (3rd and 4th century CE) and Early Medieval (5th-8th century CE) burial sites in southern Germany, comparing them to over 2,500 contemporary and Iron Age genomes in addition to 1,344 modern-day genomes from Germany, Italy and Great-Britain. Despite small inferred Early Medieval period community sizes, genetic diversity exceeded that of modern German cities. In the Altheim graveyard, established in the 5th century by a group of Northern European descent, we inferred a demographic shift in the 6th century with the integration of newcomers with ancestry typical of a nearby Roman military camp, likely as a result of the collapse of Roman state structures. We reconstructed multigenerational pedigrees and, using a novel approach to infer ancestry of unsampled relatives, inferred immediate intermarriage between incoming and local groups, with a distinct tendency for men from former Roman background marrying women of northern descent. Burial proximity correlates strongly with kinship, in some cases spanning six generations. These communities were organized around small family units, exhibited loosely patrilineal or bilateral descent patterns, practiced reproductive monogamy, and avoided close-kin marriages. Such practices reflect broader transformations in family structures that began during the Late Roman period, were transferred to small agrarian societies in the Early Medieval period, and continued to shape European societies. By the 7th century, ongoing admixture had shaped genetic diversity patterns into those resembling Central Europe today.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule partitioning remain largely unknown. Here, we first exploit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of model condensates to elucidate physicochemical rules governing small-molecule partitioning. We find that while hydrophobicity is a major determinant, solubility becomes a stronger regulator of partitioning in more polar condensates. Additionally, more polar condensates exhibit selectivity toward certain compounds, suggesting that condensate-specific therapeutics can be engineered. Building on these insights, we develop minimal models (MAPPS) for efficient prediction of small-molecule partitioning into biologically relevant condensates. We demonstrate that this approach reproduces atomistic partition coefficients in both model systems and condensates composed of the low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS. Applying MAPPS to various LCD-based condensates shows that protein sequence can exert a selective pressure, thereby influencing small-molecule partitioning. Collectively, our findings reveal that partitioning is driven by both small-molecule--protein affinity and the complex interplay between the compounds and the condensate chemical environment.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Individuals who had resolved rejection after therapy had a distinct transcriptomic profile relative to those with persistent rejection, including 216 genes across 6 cell types along pathways of inflammation, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, IFN/IFN{gamma} response, and TNF signaling. Spatial transcriptomics also identified genes linked to long-term prognostic outcomes post-HT. These results underscore importance of subtyping immunologic states during rejection to stratify immune-cardiac interactions following HT that are therapeutically relevant to short- and long-term rejection-related outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Small population sizes and the lack of recombination are two such scenarios that reduce the efficiency of selection. Under these conditions, the disconnect between deleterious genetic load and individual fitness due to the masking of recessive deleterious mutations in heterozygous individuals may result in the emergence of pseudo-overdominance, wherein the buildup of haplotypes with complementary sets of deleterious mutations results in apparent heterozygote advantage and an increase in linked neutral diversity. In polyploids, the presence of additional allelic copies magnifies this masking effect and may therefore increase the probability of pseudo-overdominance. Here, we simulate the evolution of small diploid and autotetraploid populations to identify the conditions that support the evolution of pseudo-overdominance. We discover that pseudo-overdominance evolves under a much wider range of parameters in autotetraploids than in diploids with identical population sizes, and that in many parts of parameter space there is an inverse relationship between fitness and recombination rate. These results imply that pseudo-overdominance may be more common than previously thought. We conclude by discussing the current evidence for pseudo-overdominance in species with polyploid histories, as well as its implications in agriculture due to the prevalence of polyploidy in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353

Here, we detected aut-mCAs in 1,011,269 participants across four biobanks. Through integrative analysis of the minimum critical region and inherited genetic variation, we found that proto-oncogenes exclusively drive chromosomal gains, tumor suppressors drive losses, and copy-neutral events can be driven by either. We identified three novel inherited risk loci in CHI3L2, HLA class II, and TERT that modulate aut-mCA risk and ten novel aut-mCA-specific loci. We found specific aut-mCAs are associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or kidney disease incidence. High-risk aut-mCAs were associated with elevated plasma protein levels of therapeutically actionable targets: NPM1, PARP1, and TACI. Participants with multiple high-risk features such as high clonal fraction, more than one aut-mCA, and abnormal red cell morphology had a 50% cumulative incidence of blood count abnormalities over 2 years. Leveraging inherited variation, we causally established aut-mCAs as premalignant lesions for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Together, our findings provide a framework integrating somatic mosaicism, germline genetics, and clinical phenotypes to identify individuals who could benefit from preventative interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1741557974353

However, the seasonality of COVID-19 remains in dispute, with significant waves of cases across the United States occurring in both winter and summer. Using wavelet analysis of COVID-19 cases, we find that the periodicity of epidemic COVID-19 varies markedly across the U.S. and correlates with winter temperatures, indicating seasonal forcing. However, the pattern of multiple waves per year that has been so disruptive and unique to COVID-19 cannot be explained by seasonal forcing. Using a modified SIRS model that allows specification of the tempo of waning immunity, we show that specific forms of non-durable immunity can sufficiently explain the sub-annual waves characteristic of the COVID-19 epidemic.","NA","medrxiv",1741557974353

Single nucleotide polymorphisms form the vast majority of genetic variation and play critical roles in complex, polygenic phenotypes, yet their functional impact is poorly understood from traditional gene-level analyses. In-depth knowledge on the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms has broad applications in health and disease, population genomic or evolution studies. The wealth of genomic data and available functional genetic tools make Drosophila melanogaster an ideal model species for studies at single nucleotide resolution. However, to leverage these resources and potentially combine it with the power of functional genetics to enhance genotype-phenotype research, it is essential to develop techniques to predict functional impact and causality of single nucleotide variants. Here, we present FlyCADD, a functional impact prediction tool for single nucleotide variants in D. melanogaster. FlyCADD, based on the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) framework, integrates over 650 genomic features - including conservation scores, GC content, and DNA secondary structure - into a single metric reflecting a variants predicted impact on evolutionary fitness. FlyCADD provides impact prediction scores for any single nucleotide variant on the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate FlyCADDs utility with some examples of application, including the ranking of phenotype-associated variants to prioritize variants for follow-up studies, evaluation of naturally occurring polymorphisms, and refining of CRISPR-Cas9 experimental design. FlyCADD provides a powerful framework for interpreting impact of any single nucleotide variant in D. melanogaster, thereby improving our understanding of genotype-phenotype connections.","NA","biorxiv",1741557974353
