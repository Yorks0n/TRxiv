Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Historically, research has prioritized protists associated with animals and plants, particularly those of medical significance, thereby overlooking the majority of protist diversity. Conventional molecular methods, such as 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, frequently encounter limitations, including primer binding bias and PCR bias caused by gene length variations, creating a biased perspective of understudied protistan diversity. Further, most protist lineages are notoriously difficult to cultivate. Here, we apply a cultivation-independent approach in which we analyzed over 27,000 assembled metagenomes and protist single cell genomes and 21 long 18S rRNA gene amplicon data sets from various global ecosystems, including marine, freshwater, and soil environments. We recovered 157,958 18S rRNA gene sequences ([&ge;]800 bp), which clustered into 103,338 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% sequence identity and 24,438 OTUs at 85% identity. Notably, 69% of 13,238 non-singleton clusters at 85% identity consisted exclusively of environmental sequences, uncovering a wealth of yet uncultivated and unclassified novel protist diversity. A comprehensive taxonomic framework of eukaryotes based on concatenated 18S and 28S rRNA genes that incorporated most novel lineages revealed substantial underrepresentation of Amoebozoa, Discoba, and Rhizaria in reference databases, with many lacking isolate or genome sequence representation. Further, we identified 13 eukaryotic lineages with novelty on higher taxonomic ranks, such as class and phylum-level, that lack representation in public databases. The corresponding 85% OTUs were primarily affiliated with Excavata, with some branching closely to the root of the eukaryotic tree. Comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of eukaryotes revealed uneven microbial eukaryotic diversity across supergroups and ecosystems, with notable novelty particularly in soil and marine environments. We then examined co-occurrence between protists and prokaryotes, predicting putative symbiotic or predator-prey relationships, particularly among understudied protist groups with bacteria such as Verrucomicrobia and Rickettsiales. Our results substantially enhance the understanding of protistan diversity and distribution, revealing taxonomic blind spots and laying groundwork for future studies of these organisms ecological roles.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Uncertainty remains regarding whether domestic cats originated in the Levant, Egypt or elsewhere in its natural range, and on the timing and circumstances of their dispersal into Europe. By analysing 87 ancient and modern cat genomes, we demonstrate that domestic cats did not spread to Europe with Neolithic farmers, as previously thought. Conversely, our results suggest that they were introduced to Europe over the last 2,000 years, most likely from North Africa. We also demonstrate that a separate earlier (1st millennium BCE) introduction of wildcats from Northwest Africa originated the present-day wild population in Sardinia.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoter's ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Using three-dimensional super-resolution microscopy, we comprehensively localize the human golgin family at the rim of the Golgi apparatus at 10-20 nm resolution in situ. Unexpectedly, we find that the golgins are precisely organized into a tetraplex with four discrete layers, each containing a specific set of rim golgins. We observe no golgins inside the stack between its membrane-bound cisternae. Biochemically characterizing most of the golgins as isolated proteins, we find that they form anti-parallel dimers and further self-assemble into bands of multi-micron-long filaments. Based on our findings, we propose an 'outside-in' physical model, the Golgin Organizer Hypothesis, in which the Golgi stack of cisternae and its overall ribbon morphology directly result from bending circumferential bands of rim golgin filaments onto a membrane surface, explaining stack formation without the need for special stacking proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Heterochromatin erosion is a hallmark of human ageing and H3K9me3 is lost globally in aged mammalian cells. However, the functional consequences of the loss of heterochromatin maintenance have been challenging to model. In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Cell migration is driven by the extension of actin-based lamellipodia protrusions, powered by actin polymerization, which is tightly regulated by signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and Ca2+ signaling. While the importance of Ca2+ signaling in lamellipodia protrusions has been established, the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ to lamellipodia assembly are unknown. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+ signaling axis involving the mechano-gated channel TRPV4, which regulates lamellipodia protrusions in various cell types. Using Ca2+ and FRET imaging, we demonstrate that TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx upregulates RhoA activity within lamellipodia, which then facilitates formin-mediated actin assembly. Mechanistically, we identify CaMKII and TEM4 as key mediators relaying the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal to RhoA. These data define a molecular pathway by which Ca2+ influx regulates small GTPase activity within a specific cellular domain - lamellipodia - and demonstrate the critical role in organizing the actin machinery and promoting cell migration in diverse biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Objective To determine whether individuals hospitalized for severe COVID-19 exhibit a higher incidence of new onset cognitive impairment compared to those hospitalized for other conditions. Design A retrospective study emulating a target trial using Mass General Brigham electronic health records (March 2020-August 2024). The causal effect of COVID-19 hospitalization was estimated via cumulative incidence functions accounting for the competing risk of death. Setting Multicenter hospital-based study across the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. Participants A total of 221613 hospitalized patients met the eligibility criteria, including 6454 (2.0%) admitted due to COVID-19 and 215159 (98.0%) for all other conditions. Patients were excluded if they had less than three months of follow-up (due to censoring, cognitive impairment, or death), were younger than 55 years at baseline, or had no prior visit to Mass General Brigham in the year before baseline. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was new-onset cognitive impairment, identified via ICD codes and dementia medication prescriptions. The primary analysis estimated the hazard ratio for cognitive impairment with COVID-19 hospitalization relative to other hospitalizations, along with the risk difference at 4.5 years estimated via cumulative incidence functions. Inverse propensity score weighting was used to balance covariates (age, sex, comorbidities, hospitalization period). Results Among eligible patients (mean [SD] age, 69.55 [9.42] years, 55% female), those hospitalized for COVID-19 were significantly older and had more comorbidities (p < 0.05). COVID-19 hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment (Hazard Ratio: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.02-1.30], P = 0.018). At 4.5 years, the cumulative incidence of cognitive impairment was 12.5% [95% CI: 11.3-13.5] in the COVID-19 group, compared to 11.6% [95% CI: 11.1-12.1] in the non-COVID-19 group. Conclusions and Relevance Severe COVID-19 infection was associated with an elevated risk of developing clinically recognized cognitive impairment.

Some of those symptoms could be related to autonomic dysfunction. Our aim is to evaluate the prevalence of autonomic dysfunction in long COVID patients.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study and included all consecutive patients enrolled in several clinical research studies. We performed the following autonomic dysfunction markers: heart rate variability, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure changes during NASA lean test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing and a COMPASS-31 scale. We used linear regression to calculate the contribution of each dysautonomia measure on symptom burden as measured by the modified COVID-19 Yorkshire scale.

ResultsWe included 100 patients for this study. Our sample had a mean age of 56+/-11 years, included 53% minorities and 32% were women. Dysautonomia as defined by an abnormal COMPASS-31 was seen in 82%; 95% 72-89 while cardiovascular resting dysautonomia as represented by an abnormal heart rate variability was seen in 60%; 95% 48-70 of the population, orthostatic hypotension in 12% and POTS in 10%. In our adjusted analysis, we found that the beta coefficient for the COMPASS-31 score (0.37) was significant on changes in a self-reported long COVID symptom burden. The orthostatic intolerance and gastrointestinal domains of the COMPASS-31 was associated the highest long COVID symptom burden.

ConclusionDysautonomia is common in long COVID patients and contributes to the overall symptoms seen in long COVID. Identifying dysautonomia has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999

While early visual areas are known to encode retinotopic positions, how these representations transform into invariant neural codes remains unclear. Building on a computational model of reading, we used 7T fMRI and MEG to reveal a cortical hierarchy in which early visual areas (V1-V4) predominantly encode retinotopic information, whereas higher-level regions, including the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA), transition to an ordinal letter-position code. MEG analyses confirm that retinotopic encoding emerges early (60-200 ms), followed by a shift toward ordinal representations in later time windows (220-450 ms). Despite this transition, word position remained a dominant factor across all time points, suggesting a concurrent coding of both retinotopic and abstract positional information. These findings uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics by which the human brain transforms visual input into structured linguistic representations, shedding light on the cortical stages of reading and their developmental and clinical implications.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Domestication of its wild progenitor, the African wildcat (F. lybica), is widely attributed to the emergence of farming. Wildcats are said to have been attracted to settled communities by the rodent populations that were thriving within this new agricultural niche. Some claim the African wildcat even reached Europe during the Neolithic, though many credit the Romans with their dispersal. Through a program of zooarchaeological analysis, genetic identification and radiocarbon dating, we redefine the established chronology for the cat's domestication and dispersal across Europe. We argue that early human-cat relationships were more complex than the commensal and mutualistic pathways that have been proposed, and that both the domestication and translocation of cats were linked to its association with deities. Our results suggest domestic cats first arrived in Europe prior to Roman expansion during the early first millennium BCE, and that successive populations of domestic cats with unique mitochondrial signatures were introduced during the Roman, Late Antique and Viking periods. Lastly, by characterising the spatiotemporal representation of both domestic cats and the native European wildcat (F. silvestris), we argue that the introduction of domestic cats precipitated a decline in native European wildcat populations.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Herein, we report the clinical and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infections from 179 individuals (total 185 positive samples) residing in the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance (KHDSS) area ([~]900 km2). Sixteen SARS-CoV-2 lineages within three sub-variants (XBB.2.3-like (58.4%), JN.1-like (40.5%) and XBB.1-like (1.1%)) were identified. Symptomatic infection rate was estimated at 16.0% (95% CI 11.1%-23.9%) based on community testing regardless of symptom status, and did not differ across the sub-variants (p = 0.13). The most common infection symptoms in community cases were cough (49.2%), fever (27.0%), sore throat (7.3%), headache (6.9%), and difficulty in breathing (5.5%) and one case succumbed to the infection. Genomic analysis of the virus from serial positives samples confirmed repeat infections among five participants under follow-up (median interval 21 days, range 16-95 days); in four participants, the same virus lineage was responsible in both the first and second infections, while one participant had a different lineage in the second infection compared to the first. Phylogenetic analysis including >18,000 contemporaneous global sequences estimated that at least 38 independent virus introduction events occurred into the KHDSS area during the wave, the majority likely originating in North America and Europe. Our study highlights coastal Kenya, like most other localities, continues to face new SARS-CoV-2 infection waves characterized by the circulation of new variants, multiple lineage importations and reinfections. Locally the virus may circulate unrecognized as most infections are asymptomatic in part due to high population immunity after several waves of infection. Our findings highlight the need for sustained SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to inform appropriate public health responses such as scheduled vaccination for risk populations.

Author summarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has transitioned to an endemic respiratory pathogen causing seasonal outbreaks. We examined the epidemiological and genomic patterns of a wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in coastal Kenya that occurred between November 2023 and March 2024. By analyzing genetic and epidemiological data from positive cases in Kilifi, we inferred the origins of the new strains, documented repeat infections and the virus ongoing evolution. Our data revealed several variants circulating in the community, indicating multiple new virus introductions probably before and during local outbreaks. Many infected individuals were asymptomatic, highlighting unnoticed transmission within the population. Despite low vaccination rates among the cases ([~]7.0%), high population immunity has previously been reported locally. The common symptoms among those who were symptomatic included cough, fever, and sore throat. A few participants experienced repeat infections during the wave, often involving closely related strains. The virus lineages detected were most closely related to those sampled in Europe. Our findings emphasize that, despite the end of the emergency phase, SARS-CoV-2 remains a significant public health issue, necessitating ongoing monitoring and responsive measures e.g. target vaccinations, masking and good hygiene practices to protect those at risk of severe infection.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999

Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length, wild-type human GAT3 bound to a selective inhibitor, to substrate GABA, or in substrate-free state. GAT3 bound to the inhibitor or in the substrate-free state exhibits an inward-open conformation. The inhibitor binds within the intracellular permeation pathway, positioned between transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. The GABA-bound GAT3 is captured in an inward-occluded state, revealing the ion coordination and substrate recognition network, including a cation-{pi} interaction between GABA's {gamma}-amino group and a phenylalanine residue in transmembrane helix 6.

To address the issue, we developed the restraint-guided inference method that applies stereochemical restraints during the reverse diffusion process. This approach perfectly reproduces the chirality specified in the input chemical structure and improves bond and angle geometries of ligands, while maintaining comparable performance in binding pose prediction.

One such pathway is LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which aids in phagosome maturation and subsequent signaling upon cargo uptake mediated by certain innate immunity-associated receptors. Here, we show that a specific isoform of RAB5 GTPases, the molecular switches controlling early endosome traffic, is necessary for LAP. We demonstrate that RAB5c regulates phagosome recruitment and function of complexes required for phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PI(3)P] and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by macrophages. RAB5c facilitates phagosome translocation of the V-ATPase transmembrane core, which is needed for ATG16L1 binding and consequent LC3 conjugation. RAB5c depletion impaired macrophage elimination of the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and disruption of the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis increased susceptibility in vivo. Therefore, early endosome-to-phagosome traffic is differentially regulated to promote LAP and ROS contributes to resistance against A. fumigatus by effecting LAP.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Some recent works have reported conformational state populations by counting particle-images from cryo-EM. We wish to caution the community that these measurements are highly susceptible to noise and should not be relied upon as a precise estimate of the thermodynamic landscape of a biomolecule for understanding its biological function. Here, we demonstrate that the extremely noisy nature of cryo-EM images and uncertainty in the viewing orientations of biomolecules lead to ambiguities when assigning images to structures. If ignored, this ambiguity can introduce inherent bias when determining the populations of conformational states through individual particle assignment. We further show that modeling the conformational probability distribution using the entire image dataset mitigates these biases.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

However, cost and invasiveness preclude EGD in those who have no prior GERD symptoms, despite having other risk factors, representing missed opportunities for BE screening in individuals who account for approximately 40% of the patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).

AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate if non-endoscopic methods can enable BE detection in an at-risk population without GERD symptoms.

MethodsPatients presenting for colonoscopy who had not undergone previous EGD plus had [&ge;]3 BE risk factors (from among age >50 years, male sex, white race, smoking history, family history of BE/EAC, or central obesity) without chronic GERD symptoms were prospectively recruited for non-endoscopic screening. Trained nurses administered the EsoCheck (Lucid Diagnostics) encapsulated balloon. Samples were assayed with the EsoGuard BE detection methylated DNA marker panel (Lucid Diagnostics). Patients with a positive result were offered standard-of-care EGD, while patients with a negative EG result were offered free of cost research EGD. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and BE prevalence were calculated.

ResultsThe mean age of the 132 study subjects was 60.7 years, 129 (98%) were white, 124 (94%) were male, 71 (54%) had a prior smoking history, 46 (35%) were centrally obese, and 5 (4%) reported a family history. EsoCheck was successfully administered in 124 (94%) and the EsoGuard methylated DNA marker panel could be assayed in 120 (97%) of the samples. Thirty-four assays were positive of which 27 underwent a follow-up EGD and BE was identified in 9, PPV = 33% [17%, 54%] subjects. EGD was also performed in 22 of the 86 subjects whose assays were negative and none of them had BE, NPV = 100% [85%, 100%]. A logistic regression model fitted to impute the presence of BE estimated the PPV as 27% [13%, 44%], NPV as 98% [92%, 100%], and BE prevalence as 8.4% [4.5%, 14.3%].

ConclusionPatients without chronic GERD who have [&ge;]3 BE risk factors have a moderately high prevalence of BE. Non-endoscopic detection can effectively identify BE, enabling expansion of screening to this larger at-risk population. Those with a negative EG assay have a low likelihood of BE.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999

Skeletal muscle derangements contribute to depressed exercise capacity in PAH, but the mechanisms underlying muscle dysfunction including the changes in muscle biology based on fiber type are understudied. Methods: We evaluated exercise capacity, muscle histopathology, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics in the quadriceps (predominately fast fibers) and soleus (predominately slow fibers) muscles in the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of PAH. Results: MCT rats exhibited impaired exercise capacity. Surprisngly, there were divergent atrophic and metabolic remodeling in the quadriceps and soleus muscle of MCT rats. In the quadriceps, there was a mild atrophic response only in type II fibers. In contrast, both type I and II fibers atrophied in the soleus. Both muscles exhibited fibrotic infiltration, but mitochondrial density was reduced in the quadriceps only. Mitochondrial proteomics and tissue metabolomics/lipidomics profiling demonstrated the two muscles exhibited distinct responses as the quadriceps had impairments in oxidative phosphorylation/fat metabolism and storage of triacylglycerides. However, the soleus showed signs of proteasome deficiencies and alterations in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine homeostasis. Finally, profiling of metabolites/lipids in the serum identified novel potential biomarkers of exercise intolerance in PAH including the dimethylarginine pathway, cysteine, and triacylglycerides. Conclusion: Our data suggests differential cachectic and metabolic responses occur in PAH-myopathy. We nominate mitochondrial biogenesis and proteasome activation as potential druggable targets for PAH- myopathy.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

The emergence of dual-localized mitochondrial protein isoforms coincides with mitochondrial acquisition during early eukaryotic evolution. We further reveal that eukaryotes use diverse mechanisms--such as leaky ribosome scanning, alternative transcription, and paralog duplication--to maintain the production of dual-localized isoforms. Finally, we identify multiple isoforms that are specifically dysregulated by rare disease patient mutations and demonstrate how these mutations can help explain unique clinical presentations.

Hybrid riboswitches, synthetically enhanced compact RNA elements (<100 nucleotides) that form a tertiary structure with the ability to specifically bind two different target molecules, can be used to design genetic regulators that emulate Boolean logic. When inserted into the 5' UTR of an mRNA, these devices can regulate translation initiation upon specific binding of one or both ligands. The goal of this study is to design hybrid riboswitches that emulate Boolean NAND logic in yeast. We propose a novel machine learning-based design framework combining high-throughput in vivo screening and deep Bayesian optimization. Through an initial screening, we discovered a hybrid riboswitch with NAND behavior. Using batch Bayesian optimization with an ensemble neural network as surrogate, we further improve the NAND functionality of our hybrid riboswitch with respect to a performance score, thereby achieving near digital NAND behavior. With its focus on model-based and score-driven design, our proposed method can complement experiment driven approaches by allowing fine grained adaptation of functionality, including constructs sensitive to single nucleotide changes.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Central to HIV infection and immune evasion is the envelope glycoprotein (Env), a heavily glycosylated class I fusion protein that mediates viral entry and is the sole immunogenic target. Despite the recent advancements provided by imaging techniques, the characterization of Envs structure and dynamics within its native membrane environment remains incomplete. Here, we present microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length Env glycoprotein embedded in a biologically relevant lipid bilayer with a complete glycosylation profile. Our simulations reveal a pronounced tilting motion of Env relative to the membrane, with supporting evidence from cryo-electron tomography, which also captures Env tilting within the native membrane. Importantly, we identify a critical role for N-linked glycans at N88 and N611 in modulating the tilting transition. These findings highlight the dual role of Envs glycan shield as both a protective barrier against neutralizing antibodies and a structural modulator of conformational plasticity. While providing an atomically detailed view of Env in a native membrane environment and advancing the general understanding of its glycan shield and its vulnerabilities, this work also suggests a possible strategy to modulate Envs conformational plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

However, the role of these proteins in archaea is currently unknown. Here, we describe a new class of archaeal OLD family ATPases and show that they are not involved in antiviral defense but play an essential role in cell cycle progression. We show that an OLD family enzyme of Saccharolobus islandicus REY15A (SisOLD) is essential for cell viability and exhibits cyclic expression patterns at both transcriptional and translational levels, displaying the peak expression during the genome synthesis (S) cell cycle phase. SisOLD overexpression or knockdown leads to significant growth retardation, cell size enlargement, and increased cellular DNA content. The ATPase activity but not the nickase activity of SisOLD is crucial for the normal cell cycle progression. Notably, SisOLD copurifies with chromatin-associated proteins, such as Cren7 and a histone deacetylase homolog, suggesting involvement in chromosome remodeling following its replication. Collectively our results suggest that SisOLD plays an important role in chromatin processing and remodeling, revealing a novel function of OLD family proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

The FDA-approved mKIs to date ablate receptor tyrosine kinase signaling but do not target the paradoxical WNT signaling which is a key survival driver for the self-renewing cancer stem cells. The WNT pathway enhances cancer plasticity and triggers relapse of highly heterogenous tumours. Using de novo synthesis and structure-activity-relationship (SAR) studies with blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetrant mKI scaffolds, we designed a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of PI3K, PDGFR/KIT, and the WNT pathway denoted Dyr726. Dyr726 is superior to clinical mKIs and inhibits PI3K-AKT-mTOR and WNT-pathway signaling at multiple nodes thereby impeding proliferation, invasion, and tumour growth. Phospho-proteomic, structural, and target engagement analyses, combined with in vitro, in vivo efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies reveal that Dyr726 is a brain-penetrant small molecule which effectively reduces tumour volume and extends survival of murine orthotopic models.

Other eusocial species, such as bees, ants, and termites, also have long lifespans relative to their solitary kin. We propose that eusociality drives the evolution of longevity through three mechanisms: first, individuals in eusocial populations tend to be older than in non-eusocial populations, and thus genes favoring survival at later ages are more strongly selected; second, slower growth in eusocial populations reduces early mortality from resource scarcity, making longevity more important. Finally, the fitness benefits of long lifespan are stronger when the population's reproductive success rests on the survival of a single individual. Non-eusocial species reproducing in ways that partly access these benefits also have relatively long lifespans. We demonstrate these three mechanisms using mathematical models and computer simulations, highlighting longevity as an evolvable, selectable trait. Our results echo conclusions from Life History Theory but cast them in a new light.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Although mouse models of AD have provided insight into neurobiological mechanisms contributing to impaired formation and retrieval of new memories, the process underlying the progressive loss of remote memories in AD has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate age-dependent remote memory decline in APP/PS1 mice, which coincides with progressive hyperexcitability of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Analysis of Fos expression showed that the remote memory deficit is not mirrored by changes in reactivation of memory-encoding neurons, so-called engram cells, nor PV interneuron (re)activation, in the mPFC. However, inhibitory input is enhanced onto engram cells compared to non-engram cells specifically in APP/PS1 mice. Our data indicate that age-dependent remote memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice is due to increased innervation of cortical engram cells by hyperexcitable PV interneurons, suggesting that dysfunctional inhibitory microcircuits in the neocortex mediate progressive retrograde amnesia in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

While microbial dynamics in the western Antarctic Peninsula are relatively well- studied, the northwestern region remains underexplored, particularly in long-term, multidomain analyses. To fill this gap, we investigated microbial communities encompassing all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya) in the Northwestern Antarctic Peninsula. Using the universal primer set 515Y/926R, we sequenced unfractionated seawater from ten sites over a six-year period (2013-2019). Environmental parameters, temperature and salinity, showed minimal variation across the study. However, microbial diversity and composition, especially among eukaryotic phytoplankton, displayed significant temporal changes among seasons and years. The prokaryotic community, by contrast, was relatively stable, with Gammaproteobacteria-- particularly the Nitrincolaceae family--maintaining high relative abundance throughout all sampling periods, but a few distinct ASVs. In contrast, no eukaryotic group exhibited consistently high relative abundance across sampling periods. The summer of 2016, marked by a strong El Nino event, presented the most distinct microbial community structure, underscoring the sensitivity of these communities to extreme climatic conditions. These results highlight the importance of integrated, long-term studies to better understand the dynamics, interactions, and resilience of microbial ecosystems in the rapidly changing Antarctic environment.

IMPORTANCEThis study provides a unique long-term perspective on microbial community dynamics in the Northwestern Antarctic Peninsula, a region still poorly explored through a multidomain lens. By investigating the temporal variability of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryotes over six years, we reveal distinct stability patterns between these groups, with phytoplankton showing the highest variability and prokaryotes remaining relatively stable. The strong response of the microbial community to the 2016 El Nino event highlights its sensitivity to extreme climate conditions, reinforcing the importance of understanding how Antarctic ecosystems will respond to future climate shifts. The consistent presence of Nitrincolaceae, a key bacterial taxon, suggests its ecological relevance in the region, while fluctuations in phytoplankton composition may impact food web dynamics. These findings emphasize the need for continued long-term monitoring to predict how microbial communities will adapt to environmental changes, which is crucial for assessing the future functioning of polar marine ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Despite their utility, no gnotobiotic systems have been established to investigate the role of antimicrobial effector proteins in the interactions between plants, their microbiota, and fungal pathogens. Here, we present a refined gnotobiotic system designed to study these interactions, establishing protocols for infections with the fungal pathogen Verticillium dahliae across multiple host plants under sterile conditions. We demonstrate that a synthetic microbial community (SynCom) derived from a culture collection generated for this study can be applied in this system where it interferes with fungal infections. Additionally, using our gnotobiotic system we reveal that specific antimicrobial effectors of V. dahliae, like Ave1L2, contribute to fungal virulence in a microbiota-dependent manner, whereas other antimicrobial effectors, such as Ave1, seem to possess functions beyond microbiota manipulation.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has proven effective at biomonitoring aquatic systems but remains underexplored for terrestrial habitats, partly due to point-source sampling bias and difficulty in upscaling. Air has recently emerged as a promising substrate for terrestrial biomonitoring yet most studies use active samplers which tend to be expensive, bulky, and require power. We used a newly developed, inexpensive, reusable, and easy-to-use passive airborne eDNA sampler (DNAir Sampler) to capture eDNA suspended in air over 96 hours within Rotterdam Zoo, the Netherlands. Its performance was compared to two commonly used active airborne eDNA samplers for vertebrate diversity detection. In total, 88 species were detected, including 24 zoo residents. The DNAir Sampler was the most effective at detecting zoo residents, surpassing active samplers in species richness within 48 hours and continuing to accumulate new species beyond 96 hours. It also detected the furthest species signal (515m). Zoo airborne eDNA further demonstrated a positive correlation to species total biomass. Our findings indicate that for long, un-supervised biomonitoring, passive airborne eDNA sampling outperforms active sampling for assessing vertebrate communities and potentially reduces detection noise in stochastic air eDNA signals.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Several methods now aim to leverage multiple GWAS sources, but predictive performance and computational efficiency across contexts remain unclear, especially in the absence of individual-level tuning data. Methods: This study evaluates a comprehensive set of PGS methods across African (AFR), East Asian (EAS), and European (EUR) ancestry groups for 10 complex traits, using summary statistics from the Ugandan Genome Resource, Biobank Japan, and UK Biobank. Single-source PGS were derived using methods including DBSLMM, lassosum, LDpred2, MegaPRS, pT+clump, PRS-CS, QuickPRS, and SBayesRC. Multi-source approaches included PRS-CSx, TL-PRS, X-Wing, and combinations of independently optimised single-source scores. A key contribution is the introduction of a novel application of the LEOPARD method to estimate optimal linear combinations of population-specific PGS using only summary statistics. All analyses were implemented using the GenoPred software pipeline. Results: In AFR and EAS populations, PGS combining ancestry-aligned and European GWAS outperformed single-source models. Linear combinations of independently optimised scores consistently outperformed current jointly optimised multi-source methods, while being substantially more computationally efficient. The LEOPARD extension offered a practical solution for tuning these combinations when only summary statistics were available, achieving performance comparable to tuning with individual-level data. Conclusion: These findings highlight a flexible and generalisable framework for multi-source PGS construction. The GenoPred pipeline enables researchers to tailor methods to data availability and study goals, supporting more equitable, accurate, and accessible polygenic prediction.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999

Current understanding of the Fo pathogenicity mechanisms is primarily centered on vascular plants, where individual isolates of Fo exhibit contrasting lifestyles across the endophyte-pathogen continuum on different host species. Although, Fo isolates were recently shown to cause disease on the non-vascular liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (Mp), the transcriptional control of Fo effectors during infection of this bryophytic host is largely unknown. Here, we took a comparative transcriptomic approach to ask how different Fo isolates with contrasting interaction outcomes on angiosperms (pathogenic versus endophytic) adapt to a distantly related plant lineage lacking xylem. We found that the core effector complement encoded on genomic regions shared across all Fo isolates are actively transcribed in Mp, whereas effectors encoded on lineage-specific (LS) genomic regions that contribute towards host-specific pathogenicity in angiosperms are not. Moreover, we observed enhanced transcriptional activation of effector clusters located on the three highly syntenic fast core chromosomes during growth on Mp, as well as divergent lineages and lifestyles, suggesting a conserved role in plant associations. Loss of a compatibility-associated effector encoded in a core effector cluster led to misregulation of other effectors in core clusters.

This can be studied using temporal and spatial scales of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, which provide a robust description of the topological structure and temporal dynamics of neural activity. For example, timescales of resting-state fMRI signals can parsimoniously predict a significant amount of the individual variability in functional connectivity networks identified in adult human brains. In the present study, we quantified and compared temporal and spatial scales in resting-state fMRI data collected from 2,352 subjects between the ages of 5 and 100 in Developmental, Young Adult, and Aging datasets from Human Connectome Project. For most cortical regions, we found that both temporal and spatial scales largely decreased with age across most cortical areas throughout the lifespan, with the visual cortex and the limbic network consistently showing the largest and smallest scales, respectively. For some prefrontal regions, however, these two scales displayed non-monotonic trajectories during adolescence and peaked around the same time during adolescence and decreased throughout the rest of the lifespan. We also found that cortical myelination increased monotonically throughout the lifespan, and its rate of change was significantly correlated with the changes in both temporal and spatial scales across different cortical regions in adulthood. These findings suggest that temporal and spatial scales in fMRI signals, as well as cortical myelination, are closely coordinated during both development and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

The relationship of TMBIM5 with the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex formed by MCU, MICU1-3, and EMRE remains undefined. We generated Tmbim5-deficient Drosophila that exhibit disrupted cristae architecture, premature mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, reduced calcium uptake, and mitochondrial swelling - resulting in impaired mobility and shortened lifespan. Crossing these with flies lacking mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex proteins was generally detrimental, but partial MICU1 depletion ameliorated the Tmbim5-deficiency phenotype. In human cells, MICU1 rescues morphological defects in TMBIM5-knockout mitochondria, while TMBIM5 overexpression exacerbates size reduction in MICU1-knockout mitochondria. Both proteins demonstrated opposing effects on submitochondrial localization and coexisted in the same macromolecular complex. Our findings establish a functional interplay between TMBIM5 and MICU1 in maintaining mitochondrial integrity, with implications for understanding calcium homeostasis mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

We find a dynamic gene regulatory code, with early and late postnatal GRNs regulating cell morphogenesis and synapse organization and plasticity, respectively. Our results predict sequential regulations, with early-active TFs delaying the activation of later GRNs and their putative synaptic targets.

Population variation in the growth rate and potential of mutant clones suggests the presence of genetic factors protecting against CH, but these remain largely undefined. Here, we identify a non-coding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that significantly protects against CH and myeloid malignancies by downregulating HSC-selective expression and function of the RNA-binding protein MSI2. By modeling variant effects and mapping MSI2 binding targets, we uncover an RNA network that maintains human HSCs and influences CH risk.

We present an optimized perchloric acid-based workflow with neutralization - PCA-N - that addresses these limitations. By introducing a neutralization step following protein precipitation, PCA-N enables direct enzymatic digestion without additional purification steps, reducing sample volume requirements to only 5 {micro}L of plasma while maintaining deep plasma proteome coverage. The streamlined protocol allows preparation of over 10,000 samples per day using 384-well formats at costs comparable to undepleted plasma analysis (NEAT). Rigorous validation according to the recently introduced CLSI C64 guideline demonstrated that despite somewhat higher technical variability compared to NEAT, PCA-N maintained excellent biological resolution and reproducibility. We confirmed the workflows exceptional stability through analysis of 1,500 quality control samples systematically interspersed among 36,000 plasma samples measured continuously over 311 days. Technical performance remained consistent across multiple instruments, sample preparation batches and nearly a year of measurements. Compared to NEAT plasma proteomics, PCA-N doubled the proteomic depth while maintaining comparable reagent costs and throughput. The minimal sample reequipments, operational simplicity while using only common laboratory chemical and exceptional scalability positions PCA-N as an attractive approach for population-level plasma proteomics, democratizing access to deep plasma proteome analysis.

We verify the first SCC1 cleavage site and reassign the second site. We show that multiple substrates, including separase autocleavage sites8,9 and the two SCC1 cleavage sites, interact with several docking sites in separase, including four phosphate-binding sites. We also describe the structural basis of the interaction between the cohesin subunit SA1/A2 and separase, which promotes cleavage at the second site in SCC1. Finally, using cross-linking mass spectrometry and cryoEM, we propose a model of how cohesin is targeted by human separase.

Although various nuclei isolation methods have been developed, systematic evaluations of their effects on nuclear integrity and subsequent data quality remain lacking, a critical gap with profound implications for the rigor and reproducibility. To address this, we compared three mechanistically distinct nuclei isolation strategies with brain tissues: a sucrose gradient centrifugation-based method, a spin column-based method, and a machine-assisted platform. All methods successfully captured diverse cell types but revealed considerable protocol-dependent differences in cell type proportions, transcriptional homogeneity, and the preservation of cell-type-specific and cell-state-specific markers. Moreover, isolation workflows differentially influenced contamination levels from ambient, mitochondrial, and ribosomal RNAs. Our findings establish nuclei isolation methodology as a critical experimental variable shaping snRNA-seq data quality and biological interpretation.

MOTIVATIONSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has become an essential tool for transcriptomic analysis of complex tissues. However, the quality and efficiency of data generation depend heavily on the method used for nuclear isolation. The existing isolation techniques vary in their ability to preserve nuclear integrity, minimize ambient RNA contamination, and optimize recovery rates. Despite these differences in quality, a systematic comparison of these methods, specifically for brain tissue, is lacking. This gap poses a challenge for researchers in choosing the most suitable approach for their particular experimental requirements. To address this critical issue, our study directly compared three nuclei isolation methods and evaluated their performance in terms of yield, purity, and downstream sequencing quality. By providing a comprehensive assessment, we aim to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate isolation protocol for their snRNA-seq experiments, ensuring optimal results and advancing the study of complex brain tissues at the single-nucleus level.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

As ZIKV spread into new geographic regions, it now has the potential to interact with many novel potential host species whose susceptibility to the virus has yet to be determined. Mathematical models predict a sylvatic reservoir host of ZIKV, with non-human primates (NHPs) as the likely candidates, though outbreaks in areas without NHPs suggest the presence of other unidentified sylvatic reservoir hosts. Bats, with their ability to fly and live in or near human structures, are plausible ZIKV reservoirs. However, their competence as hosts for ZIKV remains unresolved. In this study, we investigate the immune response of Old World and New World bats to ZIKV infection in vitro. Through comparative growth curves and transcriptomic analyses, we assess ZIKV susceptibility of cells derived from the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). R. aegyptiacus cells were susceptible to both African and Asian ZIKV isolates, while we observed little to no ZIKV replication in A. jamaicensis cells. Notably, ZIKV elicited a strong anti-inflammatory response in the R. aegyptiacus cell line, in contrast to the dampened inflammatory response in these bats to other viruses including Marburg virus.

AUTHOR SUMMARYThis study investigates how different lineages of Zika virus (ZIKV) interact with bat cells, specifically examining the cellular inflammatory responses. We demonstrate that cells from Old World bats (R06E cells derived from an Egyptian rousette bat) are permissive to infection by both lineages, supporting viral replication. This permissiveness suggests these cells can support the virus lifecycle, potentially facilitating broader transmission. In contrast, cells from New World bats (Aji cells from Jamaican fruit bats) exhibit low susceptibility to ZIKV, with negligible viral replication observed, suggesting an inherent resistance or lack of necessary factors for ZIKV to effectively initiate its lifecycle in this cell culture model. Our findings highlight the critical role of specific host cell characteristics in ZIKV transmission and underscore the importance of cellular context in understanding the viruss capability to induce an inflammatory immune response. By exploring the interactions of ZIKV with different bat cells, our research provides insights into the ecological and epidemiological complexities of ZIKV and provides insights into the evolutionary history of this virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

A major translational challenge in analgesic development is the difference in gene expression and functional properties between human and rodent dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons. Extensive work in rodents suggests that sensitization of nociceptors in the DRG is essential for the pathogenesis and persistence of pain; however, direct evidence demonstrating similar physiological sensitization in humans is limited. Here, we examine whether pain history is associated with nociceptor hyperexcitability in human DRG (hDRG). We identified three electrophysiologically distinct clusters (E-types) of hDRG neurons based on firing properties and membrane excitability. Combining electrophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA-sequencing (""Patch-seq""), we linked these E-types to specific transcriptionally defined nociceptor subpopulations. Comparing hDRG neurons from donors with and without evident pain history revealed cluster-specific, pain history-associated differences in hDRG excitability. Finally, we found that hDRG from donors with pain history express higher levels of transcripts encoding voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (NaV1.7) and 1.8 (NaV1.8) which specifically regulate nociceptor excitability. These findings suggest that donors with pain history exhibit distinct hDRG electrophysiological profiles compared to those without pain history and further validate NaV1.7 and 1.8 as targets for analgesic development.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

In addition, while the gene regulatory networks governing distinct embryonic and larval cell lineages are well studied, the molecular and morphological identities of post-metamorphic sea urchin cell types remain poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed the cell type atlas of post-metamorphic Paracentrotus lividus juveniles using single-nucleus transcriptomics, shedding light on the conservation of genetic regulatory mechanisms in post-metamorphic cell types.

Paradoxically, high protein concentrations are typically required for condensate nucleation5, yet attaining sufficient protein levels in infection is thought to require IBs for viral transcription and replication. To uncover how viruses solve this paradox to establish IBs, we visualized early infection of RSV in real-time with single genomic viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) resolution. Our results reveal that IBs are nucleated from infecting vRNPs rather than de novo in the cytoplasm. IB nucleation further requires in-virion pre-assembly of viral protein-protein interaction networks on vRNPs to form  pre-replication centers (PRCs). PRCs are potent condensate nucleation seeds due to their resistance to disassembly and efficient recruitment of newly-synthesized viral proteins. The high protein affinity of PRCs also results in increased polymerase complex association, allowing efficient viral transcription even in the absence of IBs. Together, these activities create a feed-forward loop that drives rapid IB formation. Intriguingly, PRC assembly depends on in-virion viral protein levels and is highly heterogeneous among virions, explaining cell-to-cell heterogeneity in infection progression, and identifying heterogeneous virions as the origin of infection heterogeneity. Together, our results show that in-virion pre-assembly of PRCs kick-starts viral condensate nucleation upon host-cell entry, and explains cell-to-cell heterogeneity in RSV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Phospholipids and sterols have been shown to regulate permeation through Cx32 GJCs, although the mechanism of regulation of Cx32 and other GJCs by lipids remains poorly understood. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of Cx32 GJCs reconstituted in nanodiscs, revealing that phospholipids block the pore of Cx32 GJC by binding to the site formed by N-terminal gating helices. The phospholipid-bound state is contingent on the presence of a sterol molecule bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminus: the N-terminal helix of Cx32 fails to sustain a phospholipid binding site in the absence of cholesterol hemisuccinate. Consistent with this, the CMT1X-linked W3S mutant which has an impaired sterol binding site adopts a conformation of the N-terminus incompatible with phospholipid binding. Our results indicate that different lipid species control connexin channel gating directly by influencing the conformation of the N-terminal gating helix.

Here we describe three ligand binding sites and the associated receptor conformations for the honeybee RDL receptor, combining cryo-EM, electrophysiology and molecular dynamics. First the conservation of the GABA site explains the absence of insect-selective orthosteric compounds. Second, the classical modulation site, occupied here by abamectin, exists in a closed-pore conformation contrasting with ivermectin-bound states in other receptors. Third, using the fungal-derived Chrodrimamin B, we resolve an unanticipated membrane modulation pocket structurally analogous yet pharmacologically opposite to a neurosteroid site in mammalian receptors. Structures also reveal the existence of an intersubunit, conformation-dependent, PIP2 lipid site. We foresee our results to be the starting point for investigations on the physiological modulation of insect GABAA receptors. The honeybee receptor structures may also foster the search for environmentally benign insecticides.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

However, DR is implemented using different diets and methods across species, and evidence for conservation at the mechanistic level remains limited. Here we tested the longevity and fecundity response to DR across eight different species of Drosophila using the same diets in a reaction norm framework. We confirm that DR is phenotypically conserved across Drosophila. Next, we used comparative transcriptomics across six species and found strongly concordant differential expression in response to DR (rs > 0.28, < 0.72, P < 0.0001). We studied the evolutionary history of the top concordantly differentially expressed orthologous genes and identified that the large majority of these genes are young genes and are Diptera specific. Our results indicate that large parts of the DR response are likely to be taxonomic specific, suggesting that the genetic basis of DR is not widely conserved. To validate this hypothesis we tested whether the 15 most conserved genes that change in transcription in response to DR using conditional in vivo RNAi. Surprisingly, we found that 12 out of 15 genes tested had a lifespan phenotype, with 9 extending lifespan. Five of these genes are related to cysteine metabolism implicating it in the mechanisms of DR, further suggesting physiological compensation to DR is ubiquitous and providing a possible biomedical target. Our findings suggest that while large parts of the DR response are taxonomically specific, some core mechanisms are conserved across divergent species. The comparative approaches we used here hold promise to identify shared mechanisms relevant to our own species and therefore ultimately anti-ageing interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

However the first generation iGABASnFR exhibits low signal-to-noise and suboptimal kinetics, making in vivo experiments challenging. To improve sensor performance, we targeted several sites in the protein for near-saturation mutagenesis, and evaluated the resulting sensor variants in a high throughput screening system using evoked synaptic release in primary cultured neurons. This identified a sensor variant, iGABASnFR2, with 4.2-fold improved sensitivity and 20% faster kinetics, and binding affinity that remained in a range sensitive to changes in GABA concentration at synapses. We also identified sensors with an inverted response, decreasing fluorescence intensity upon GABA binding. We termed the best such negative-going sensor iGABASnFR2n, which can be used to corroborate observations with the positive-going sensor. These improvements yielded a qualitative enhancement of in vivo performance, enabling us to make the first measurements of direction selective GABA release in the retina and confirm a longstanding hypothesis for how sensitivity to motion arises in the visual system.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

TEI can be initiated and maintained by small RNAs and histone modifications. The latter includes histone methylation, deposited by proteins with methyltransferase activity, including SET domain-containing proteins. Other SET domain-containing proteins with no catalytic methyltransferase activity also adopt roles in chromatin and gene expression regulation. Here, we describe SET-24, a SET domain-containing protein in Caenorhabditis elegans that belongs to a family of catalytically inactive SET proteins. SET-24 localises to germline nuclei and is required for germline immortality. Additionally, the inheritance of small RNA-driven epigenetic silencing is compromised in set-24 mutants. Using quantitative proteomics and yeast two-hybrid assays, we found that SET-24 interacts with Host Cell Factor 1 (HCF-1), a protein involved in epigenetic regulation and associated with known chromatin remodelling complexes, like COMPASS, which deposits H3K4me3. In set-24 mutants, hundreds of genes display increased H3K4me3 levels at their transcription start sites. While these changes are not matched at the transcriptional level, small RNA production is disrupted in approximately one fifth of those genes, which are normally targeted by small RNA pathways. We propose that SET-24 is a factor required to maintain epigenetic memory in the germline by maintaining a chromatin environment permissible to small RNA biogenesis over generations.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Here, we characterize the physiological role of the previously-uncharacterized serine recombinase PinR of Escherichia coli cryptic prophage rac and discover that it inhibits T2 phage infection by inverting a 1,797 bp segment in a different cryptic prophage e14 to inhibit T2 infection; this inversion leads to the formation of a novel protein from two spliced genes, StfE2, that we find blocks phage adsorption. Modeling shows StfE2 inhibits T2 phage adsorption by preventing Gp38 binding to its primary receptors porins FadL and OmpF. Corroborating the receptor-blocking hypothesis, T2 escape mutants evolve resistance to PinR phage defense by mutating gp38 to remove 16 aa in the hyper variable region 3. Therefore, we discovered the first recombinase-activated phage inhibition system.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999

Because dopamine influences blood vessel dilation, we hypothesized that hemodynamic latency, which reflects BOLD signal timing, could serve as an indirect marker of dopamine physiology. Across four datasets, we found a topography of hemodynamic latencies that precisely distinguished the nucleus accumbens, a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and substance abuse, from other striatal regions. Using PET, genetics, and pharmacology, we found that hemodynamic latencies are robustly related to dopamine function and dopamine-linked behavior. In individuals with cocaine use disorder, we observed a spatial gradient of altered hemodynamic latencies in the striatum. This pattern independently predicted nicotine use, revealing a conserved physiological profile associated with addictive substance use. Hemodynamic latencies map regional, individual, and pathological differences linked to dopamine, opening new avenues for indirectly assessing the role of dopamine in healthy cognition and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1743372508999

Preliminary evidence has shown the gut microbiome influences the aging process of bone and muscle in animal studies. However, such evidence in humans is still scarce. This study aimed to assess the microbiome-bone and microbiome-muscle associations in two cohorts of community-dwelling older adults.

MethodsWe leveraged information from two large population-based cohorts, i.e., the Rotterdam Study (mean age 62.7 {+/-} 5.6 years; n=1,249) and the Framingham Heart Study (mean age 55.2 {+/-} 9.1 years; n=1,227). For individuals included in this study, gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing, musculoskeletal phenotyping derived from DXA images, lifestyle and socioeconomic data, and medication records were available. Per cohort, the 16S rRNA sequencing data, derived from stool, were processed with the DADA2 pipeline and taxonomies were assigned using the SILVA reference database. In addition, the microbiome functional potential was obtained with PICRUSt2. Further, we investigated the association between the human gut microbiome (alpha diversity, genera and predicted functional pathways) and appendicular lean mass (ALM), femoral neck bone mineral density (FN-BMD) and trabecular bone score (TBS) using multilinear regression models controlling for multiple confounders, and performed a joint analysis from both cohorts. Sex-stratified analyses were also conducted.

ResultsThe gut microbiome alpha diversity was not associated with either tested phenotype after accounting for multiple-testing (P>1.67e-02). In the joint analysis, lower abundance of Oscillibacter (beta= -0.51, 95%CI [-0.74, -0.29]), Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.41, 95%CI [-0.61, - 0.21]), Eisenbergiella (beta=-0.39, 95%CI [-0.59, -0.19]) and higher abundance of Agathobacter (beta=0.40, 95%CI [0.20, 0.60]) were associated with higher ALM (P<2.0e-04). Lower abundance of Anaerotruncus (beta=-0.32, 95%CI [-0.45, -0.19]), Hungatella (beta=-0.26, 95%CI [-0.38, -0.15]) and Clostridiales bacterium DTU089 (beta=-0.37, 95%CI [-0.55, -0.19]) was associated with higher ALM only in females (P< 2.0e-04). Moreover, the biotin biosynthesis II pathway was positively associated with ALM (beta=0.44, 95% CI [0.24, 0.64]) (P<1.90e-04) in females while no associations were observed in males. We did not observe any robust association of bone traits with gut microbiome features.

ConclusionOur results indicate that specific genera are associated with ALM in middle-aged and older adults and these associations can present in a sex-specific manner. Overall, our study suggests that the gut microbiome is linked to muscle aging in middle-aged and older adults. However, larger sample sizes are still needed to underpin the specific microbiome features involved.","NA","medrxiv",1743372508999
