Mixotrophy in ciliates is commonplace, but has been investigated at a cellular and molecular level almost entirely in one organism, Paramecium bursaria. Reliance on just one model system makes it difficult to know which cell biological aspects of this system represent general features of ciliate mixotrophy versus accidental features of the specific organism. Here we describe the cell biology and genome of the giant heterotrichous ciliate Stentor pyriformis. We show that this giant unicellular organism contains Chlorella variabilis as its endosymbiont, that the Chlorella can live freely outside the host, that within the host the Chlorella cells are docked near the cell surface, surrounded by microtubule ""baskets"", and that the photosynthetic efficiency of the Chlorella is reduced inside the Stentor cell compared to when it is free-living outside the host, with photon energy instead being shunted to non-photochemical quenching. Compared to the non-mixotrophic Stentor coeruleus, S. pyriformis has several distinct cellular features that may be related to endosymbiosis: the presence of microtubule baskets, which are absent in S. coeruleus; positive rather than negative phototaxis, which is likely an adaptation to allow the photosynthetic symbionts access to sufficient light; and a lack of pigment in the host cell, which may be an adaptation to tolerate high light levels. Compared to P. bursaria, S. pyriformis has several similar cellular features: in both organisms, the symbiont is a strain of Chlorella variabilis; the Chlorella endosymbiont retains the ability to live freely when separated from the host; and the algal symbionts contained in perialgal vesicles are docked at the cell surface. One potentially informative difference between P. bursaria and S. pyriformis is that S. pyriformis employs a standard genetic code, similar to other Stentor species but different from most other ciliates, including P. bursaria, which use a non-standard code in which one or more stop-codons are respecified to encode amino acids. This difference in genetic code could serve as a barrier to impede gene transfer from symbiont to host in other ciliates, but this would not be a factor in S. pyriformis. A second cell biological difference is that whereas P. bursaria performs phototaxis by a kinetic accumulation mechanism, in which swimming is non-directional but cells slow down in regions of higher light intensity, S. pyriformis performs directed swimming towards the direction of high light intensity. However, as in P. bursaria, phototaxis in S. pyriformis requires the presence of the Chlorella, implying a potential flow of information from the symbiont to direct the orientation and swimming of the host cell. We propose that S. pyriformis will serve as a useful model system for studying the evolution of mixotrophy and endosymbiosis, with unique advantages in terms of size and regenerative ability as well as distinct cellular and genomic features compared with other mixotrophic ciliate models.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

They infect and cause disease in humans, animals and plants but also play crucial roles in the ecology of microbial communities. Tolerance to genetic change, high-mutation rates, adaptations to hosts and immune escape has driven high divergence of viral genes, hampering their functional annotation and phylogenetic inference. The protein structure is more conserved than sequence and can be used for searches of distant homologs and evolutionary analysis of divergent proteins. Structures of viral proteins are traditionally underrepresented in public databases, but recent advances in protein structure prediction allows us to address this issue. Combining two state-of-the-art approaches, AlphaFold2-ColabFold and ESMFold, we predicted models for 85,000 proteins from 4,400 human and animal viruses, expanding the structural coverage for viral proteins by 30 times compared to experimental structures. We also performed structural and network analyses of the models to demonstrate their utility for functional annotation and inference of distant phylogenetic relationships. Taking this approach, we examined the deep evolutionary history of viral class-I fusion glycoproteins, gaining insights on the origins of coronavirus spike protein. To enable further discoveries, we have created Viro3D (https://viro3d.cvr.gla.ac.uk/), a virus species-centred protein structure database. It allows users to search, browse and download protein models from a virus of interest and explore similar structures present in other virus species. This resource will facilitate fundamental molecular virology, investigation of virus evolution, and may enable structure-informed design of therapies and vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Viral sequencing during the pandemic allowed us to track disease spread, quickly identify new variants, and guide the development of vaccines. Tiled amplicon sequencing, in which a panel of primers is used for multiplex amplification of fragments across an entire genome, was the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. The speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of this method led to its implementation in academic and public health laboratories across the world and adaptation to a broad range of viral pathogens. However, similar methods are not available for larger bacterial genomes, for which whole-genome sequencing typically requires in vitro culture. This increases costs, error rates and turnaround times. The need to culture poses particular problems for medically important bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which are slow to grow and challenging to culture. As a proof of concept, we developed two novel whole-genome amplicon panels for M. tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Applying our amplicon panels to clinical samples, we show the ability to classify pathogen subgroups and to reliably identify markers of drug resistance without culturing. Development of this work in clinical settings has the potential to dramatically reduce the time of diagnosis of drug resistance for multiple drugs in parallel, enabling earlier intervention for high priority pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Our cryo-EM analysis of UBR4 in complex with its cofactors KCMF1 and CALM1 reveals a massive 1.3 MDa ring structure, featuring a central substrate-binding arena and flexibly attached catalytic units. Structural data illustrate how UBR4 binds substrate and extends K48-specific ubiquitin chains. Importantly, efficient substrate targeting depends on both pre-ubiquitination and specific N-degrons, with KCMF1 acting as key substrate filter. Furthermore, we show that the architecture of the E4 megacomplex is conserved across eukaryotes but with species specific adaptations, allowing UBR4 to perform its precisely tuned quality-control function in diverse cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, the mechanism(s) by which changes in LD composition and dynamics contribute to pathophysiology of these disorders remains unclear. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a droplet associated protein with a common risk variant (E4) that confers the largest increase in genetic risk for late-onset AD. E4 is associated with both increased neuroinflammation and excess LD accumulation. In the current study, we sought to quantitatively profile the lipid and protein composition of LDs between the neutral E3 and risk variant E4, to gain insight into potential LD-driven contributions to AD pathogenesis. Targeted replacement mice expressing human E3 or E4 were injected with saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and after 24 hours, hepatic lipid droplets were isolated for proteomic and lipidomic analyses. Lipidomics revealed a shift in the distribution of glycerophospholipids in E4 LDs with a concomitant increase in phosphatidylcholine species, and overall, the baseline profile of E4 LDs resembled that of the LPS-treated groups. Quantitative proteomics showed that LDs from E4 mice are enriched for proteins involved in protein/vesicle transport but have decreased levels of proteins involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Interestingly, proteins associated with LDs showed substantial overlap with previously published lists of AD postmortem tissue and microglia -omics studies, suggesting a potential role for LDs in modulating AD risk or progression. Given this, we exposed primary microglia from the same E3 or E4 mice to exogenous lipid, inflammatory stimulation, necroptotic N2A cells (nN2A), or a combination of treatments to evaluate LD formation and its impact on the cells immune state. Microglia from E4 mice accumulated more LDs in every condition tested, at baseline, and following addition of fatty acids, LPS stimulation, or nN2As. E4 microglia also secreted significantly more cytokines (TNF, IL-1b, IL-10) than E3 microglia in the control, oleic acid, and nN2A treatment conditions, yet showed a blunted response to LPS. In sum, these results suggest that E4 microglia accumulate more LDs compared to E3 microglia and that E4 is associated with a basal LD composition that resembles a pro-inflammatory cell. Together with the high overlap of the LD proteome with established AD-associated datasets, these data further support the idea that alterations in LD dynamics, particularly within microglia, may contribute to the increased risk for AD associated with APOE4.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

By contrast, Marchantia-specific immune mechanisms have not been explored. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of quantitative resistance in M. polymorpha against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum nymphaeae, a naturally occurring compatible parasite. Through a combination of phenotypic, cytological and transcriptomic approaches, combined with genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we identified key defense-related genes and pathways. Transcriptomic analyses performed on two lines with contrasting suceptibilities to the pathogen revealed a strong overlap in immune responses between M. polymorpha and angiosperms, including the upregulation of PR proteins, transcription factors typically associated with biotic stresses, and enzymes involved in specialized metabolism. Leveraging the biological and genetic variability present in a collection of natural M. polymorpha accessions, highlight the role of horizontally transferred microbial-like terpene synthase (MTPSL) genes, which may contribute to the exceptional terpene diversity in liverworts and play a role in pathogen resistance. GWAS uncovered candidate loci associated with resistance traits, implicating both core immune components and specialized metabolic pathways. These results provide new insights into the specific molecular underpinnings of bryophyte immunity and underscore the evolutionary significance of horizontal gene transfer and specialized metabolites in shaping plant-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

An example of an important social association is that between breeding partners - a key social connection in monogamously breeding species. The selection of a breeding partner begins well before reproduction for many species, and this process can have consequences for subsequent reproductive success. Thus, the non-breeding season can shape behaviour during the breeding season. However, it is currently unknown how outcomes in the breeding season can impact associate choice during the non-breeding season, as studying this has been limited due to requiring high volumes of individual social data across both contexts. This study used three years of wild great tit social data from Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK, to examine social associations between pairs classified with respect to prior and future relationship status. We found a distinct behavioural pattern in divorced pairs, which was present from early in the winter, suggesting that the act of divorce occurs soon after the completion of the breeding season. Pairs forming for the first time behaved similarly to divorced pairs earlier in the season, but became similar to faithful pairs throughout the winter. On a finer spatiotemporal scale the behaviour of faithful and divorced birds diverged over the winter. These results provide the first evidence of when divorce occurs in paired great tits, while suggesting that different behaviours may drive behavioural divorce at different times.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Despite its clinical success, the mechanism through which daptomycin exerts its antibacterial properties has remained controversial. Much of the debate is focused around daptomycin's ability to depolarise the cytoplasmic membrane, potential formation of large membrane pores, and its more recently discovered capability to inhibit cell wall synthesis and disturb membrane lipid domain organisation through interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. Here we show that, rather than representing different facets of a single underlying activity, daptomycin exhibits two independent antibacterial mechanisms of action: (i) targeting of cell wall precursor lipids that leads to cell wall synthesis inhibition and (ii) membrane depolarisation that does not rely on interactions with cell wall precursor lipids. This dual mechanism of action provides an explanation for the frequently disagreeing findings obtained through in vivo and in vitro studies and explains why resistance development towards daptomycin is slow and multifactorial. In a broader context, this demonstrates that dual mechanism antibiotics can be clinically successful and exhibit favourable characteristics in terms of real-world, clinically relevant resistance development.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Coral bleaching, the disruption of the symbiosis between stony corals and zooxanthellate algae, is driven by climate change-induced seawater warming and further exacerbated by pathogenic microbes. However, how pathogens, especially viruses, contribute to accelerated bleaching remains poorly understood. The present study utilizes the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis to explore these dynamics by creating a transgenic line with a reporter gene regulated by sequences from two RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) genes involved in antiviral responses. Under heat stress, the reporter gene showed significant upregulation, indicating that these regulatory sequences are indeed responsive to thermal stress. Analyses of transcriptome data of N. vectensis, Exaiptasia diaphana (another sea anemone), and the stony coral Stylophora pistillata revealed stress-induced activation of a set of bona fide immune-related genes conserved between the three species. Population-specific differences in stress-induced transcriptional responses of immune-related genes were evident in both Nematostella and Stylophora, depending on geographic origin. In Exaiptasia, the presence or absence of zooxanthellae also influenced stress-induced immune gene expression. To test whether the viruses themselves may contribute to this immune response under stress, we subjected Nematostella polyps to variable periods of heat stress and measured the transcript levels of resident viruses as well as selected antiviral genes. While the antiviral genes responded within 1-3 hours of heat stress, viral gene expression was already upregulated within 30 minutes, suggesting that their increase might be contributing to the elevated immune response under stress, and consequentially, the further demise of organismal homeostasis. These findings highlight the complex interplay between environmental stress, viruses, immune responses, and symbiotic states in Hexacorallia. Better understanding of these mechanisms could provide insights into the role of immune pathways in coral resilience and bleaching in a changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures.

Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains.

Through in vitro triT acetylation and bioactivity assays, we show that acetylation functions as a resistance mechanism. Genomic searches of triculamin BGC genes across bacteria show that triculamin is more widely distributed than previously anticipated, as triculamin-like core peptides are found in at least three phyla in contrast to previously described lasso peptides that are typically restricted to one phylum. Triculamin BGCs with both canonical and non-canonical RiPP biosynthetic genes were identified. Two strains containing canonical triculamin-like BGCs were chemically characterized and shown to produce the novel triculamin-like lasso peptides palmamin and gelatinamin, the latter of which appears to have an unprecedented additional ring formation. Detailed phylogenetic investigation of the macrocyclases from triculamin-like BGCs suggests that these molecules are products of convergent evolution. These findings broaden the evolutionary and functional landscape of lasso peptides, revealing their unexpected diversification and cross-phylum distribution.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

By live imaging and high-throughput image analysis, we have now tracked sarcomeric components during Drosophila muscle development and discovered that individual sarcomeres divide along the myofibril tension axis into daughter sarcomeres. This way, new sarcomeres can be inserted into contractile and mechanically intact myofibrils. We propose that sarcomere division is triggered by tension and local sarcomere damage originating from skeletal growth and muscle contractions. Sarcomere divisions repair damaged sarcomeres, ensure their mechanical integrity and synchronise sarcomere addition with skeletal growth during animal development.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, stable genome editing in plants remains limited by the time- and labor-intensive process of generating transgenic plants, as well as by the efficient isolation of desired heritable edits. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the morphogenic regulator GRF-GIF on plant regeneration and genome editing outcomes in tomato. We demonstrate that expressing a tomato GRF-GIF chimera reliably accelerates the onset of shoot regeneration from callus tissue culture by approximately one month and nearly doubles the number of recovered transgenic plants. Consequently, the GRF-GIF chimera enables the recovery of a broader range of edited haplotypes and simplifies the isolation of mutants harboring heritable edits, but without markedly interfering with plant growth and development. Based on these findings, we outline strategies that employ basic or advanced diagnostic pipelines for efficient isolation of single and higher-order mutants in tomato. Our work represents a technical advantage for tomato transformation and genome editing, with potential applications across other Solanaceae species.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Traveling waves is a potential mechanism to coordinate information transfer through organizing the timing or spatiotemporal patterns of wave propagation. Based on direct human intracranial EEG recordings, we detected bidirectional hippocampal and parahippocampal traveling waves (4-10 Hz) along the posterior-anterior axis during a verbal memory task. Hippocampal traveling waves enhanced hippocampal-parahippocampal and intra-hippocampal couplings in both amplitude and phase as well as hippocampal theta phase-gamma amplitude coupling, suggesting a facilitatory role of TWs.

Condensation can be driven by phase separation of proteins, and involves highly dynamic, multivalent, and weak interactions of their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Understanding these interactions has been limited by the lack of large-scale experimental methods capable of generating thermodynamic data. Here, we develop and use Condensate Partitioning by mRNA-Display (CPmD) to directly measure the energetics of the partitioning of almost 100,000 peptides of 14 to 40 amino acid length into condensates formed by an IDR, that of the germ granule protein Dead-box helicase 4 (DDX4). This large set of peptides contained many that were derived from DDX4 itself, as well as a tiling library of a significant fraction of all experimentally characterised IDRs. We show that the results of such large scale partitioning studies yield a uniquely quantitative picture of the driving forces that govern IDR condensate formation of DDX4, as well as partitioning of other sequences into its condensates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the derived set of interactions is also able to quantitatively explain condensate formation of unrelated sequences.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Microbiomes have the capacity to influence their hosts' fitnesses, but the conditions under which such influences contribute to evolution are not clear. This is due in part to a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the combined effects of host and associated microbes on phenotypic variation. Here we begin to address this gap by extending the foundations of quantitative genetic theory to include host-associated microbes, as well as alleles of hosts, as factors that explain quantitative host trait variation. We introduce a way to partition host-associated microbiomes into componenents relevant for predicting a microbiome-mediated response to selection. We then apply our general framework to a simulation model of microbiome inheritance to illustrate principles for predicting host trait dynamics, and to generalize classical narrow and broad sense heritabilities to account for microbial effects. We demonstrate that microbiome-mediated responses to host selection can arise from various transmission modes, not solely vertical, with the contribution of non-vertical modes depending on host life history. Our work lays a foundation for integrating microbiome-mediated host variation and adaptation into our understanding of natural variation.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Most cases of eukaryote HGT reported to date are inter-domain transfers and only few studies have investigated eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGTs. Furthermore, the extent to which HGT has contributed to the gene repertoire of some lineages such as vertebrates remains unclear. Here, we performed a large-scale survey of HGT among 242 species of ray-finned fishes. We found strong evidence supporting 18 teleost-to-teleost HGT events that involve 17 different genes in 11 teleost fish orders. The genes involved in these transfers show lower synonymous divergence than expected under vertical transmission, their phylogeny is inconsistent with that of teleost fishes, and high nucleotide similarity on these genes between donor and recipient lineages extends to non-coding regions. The distribution of HGT events in the teleost tree is heterogenous, with eight of the 18 transfers occurring between the same two orders (Osmeriformes and Clupeiformes). Besides the previously reported transfer of an antifreeze protein, most transferred genes play roles in immunity, suggesting that such genes are more likely than others to confer strong selective advantage to the recipient species. Overall, our work shows that teleost-to-teleost HGT has occurred on multiple occasions and it will be worth further quantifying these transfers and evaluating their impact on teleost evolution as more genomes are being sequenced.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

These latter mechanisms are mediated by defence systems, including DNA-degrading systems such as Restriction-Modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, as well as abortive infection systems that induce cell death or dormancy. Computational studies suggest that bacterial genomes encode several defence systems, which may act synergistically to enhance phage resistance. However, the regulation, interactions, and ecological roles of these systems in native hosts remain poorly understood. This study explored the role of eight predicted defence systems in the clinical isolate NILS69 of E. coli by testing its susceptibility to 93 phages. Infectivity and adsorption assays using mutants defective in these systems revealed that only PD-T4-3 and RM systems restricted phages able to adsorb. The RM system acted via a predicted Type IV endonuclease and was also able to limit plasmid conjugation if the plasmid was transferred from a donor strain lacking a methylase, which is the hallmark of Type I, II or III RM systems. Other defence systems showed no detectable activity, likely due to phage specificity, environmental regulation, or cofactor requirements. These findings underscore the need for further studies to investigate the regulation and ecological roles of bacterial defence systems in their native host contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

In Stage 1 of the project, a list of potential trustworthiness checks was created. The checks on this list must be evaluated to determine which should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

MethodsWe attempted to apply 72 trustworthiness checks to RCTs in 50 Cochrane Reviews. For each, we recorded whether the check was passed, failed or possibly failed, or whether it was not feasible to complete the check. Following application of the checks, we recorded whether we had concerns about the authenticity of each RCT. We repeated each meta-analysis after removing RCTs flagged by each check, and again after removing RCTs where we had concerns about authenticity, to estimate the impact of trustworthiness assessment. Trustworthiness assessments were compared to Risk of Bias and GRADE assessments in the reviews.

Results95 RCTs were assessed. Following application of the checks, assessors had some or serious concerns about the authenticity of 25% and 6% of the RCTs, respectively. Removing RCTs with either some or serious concerns resulted in 22% of meta-analyses having no remaining RCTs. However, many checks proved difficult to understand or implement, which may have led to unwarranted scepticism in some instances. Furthermore, we restricted assessment to meta-analyses with no more than 5 RCTs, which will distort the impact on results. No relationship was identified between trustworthiness assessment and Risk of Bias or GRADE.

ConclusionsThis study supports the case for routine trustworthiness assessment in systematic reviews, as problematic studies do not appear to be flagged by Risk of Bias assessment. The study produced evidence on the feasibility and impact of trustworthiness checks. These results will be used, in conjunction with those from a subsequent Delphi process, to determine which checks should be included in the INSPECT-SR tool.

Plain language summarySystematic reviews collate evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to find out whether health interventions are safe and effective. However, it is now recognised that the findings of some RCTs are not genuine, and some of these studies appear to have been fabricated. Various checks for these ""problematic"" RCTs have been proposed, but it is necessary to evaluate these checks to find out which are useful and which are feasible. We applied a comprehensive list of ""trustworthiness checks"" to 95 RCTs in 50 systematic reviews to learn more about them, and to see how often performing the checks would lead us to classify RCTs as being potentially inauthentic. We found that applying the checks led to concerns about the authenticity of around 1 in 3 RCTs. However, we found that many of the checks were difficult to perform and could have been misinterpreted. This might have led us to be overly sceptical in some cases. The findings from this study will be used, alongside other evidence, to decide which of these checks should be performed routinely to try to identify problematic RCTs, to stop them from being mistaken for genuine studies and potentially being used to inform healthcare decisions.

A WGD occurred in an ancestor of arachnopulmonates (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), which provides an important independent comparison to WGDs in other animals like vertebrates and horseshoe crabs. After WGD, arachnopulmonates retained many duplicated copies (ohnologues) of key developmental genes including the clusters of homeobox genes many of which have been inferred to have undergone subfunctionalisation. However, there has been little systematic analyses of gene regulatory sequences and comparison of the expression of ohnologues versus their single-copy orthologues between arachnids. Here we compared the regions of accessible chromatin and gene expression of ohnologues and single-copy genes during three specified embryonic stages between an arachnopulmonate arachnid, the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum and a non-arachnopulmonate arachnid, the harvestman Phalangium opilio. We found that the expression of each spider ohnologue was lower than their single-copy orthologues in the harvestman providing further evidence for subfunctionalisation. However, this was not reflected in a reduction in peaks of accessible chromatin because both spider ohnologues and single-copy genes had more peaks than the harvestman genes. We also found peaks of open chromatin that increased in the late stage associated with activation of genes expressed later during embryogenesis in both species. Taken together, our study provides the first genome-wide comparison of gene regulatory sequences and gene expression in an arachnopulmonate and a non-arachnopulmonate and thus provides new insights into the impact of the arachnopulmonate WGD.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Currently known phage counter-defense systems are specific to (the activity of) the targeted bacterial defense system. Here, we uncover a mechanism by which the T7 bacteriophage broadly counteracts bacterial defenses using protein phosphorylation. We show that the T7 protein kinase (T7K), which was believed to specifically redirect the function of a few host proteins, is in fact a hyper-promiscuous, dual-specificity kinase enacting a massive wave of phosphorylation on virtually all host and phage proteins during infection. The scale of phosphorylation vastly exceeds the number of previously known phosphorylation events in E. coli, has no sequence motif specificity, and results in a higher proteome-wide phosphorylation density than that of mammalian cells which encode ~ 500 kinases. Stoichiometry analysis of phosphorylation sites revealed a strong bias of T7K activity towards nucleic acid-binding substrates, which we show is mediated by its C-terminal DNA-binding domain. This specificity for highly stoichiometric phosphorylation of nucleic acid-binding proteins enables the deactivation of DNA-targeting or -containing bacterial defense systems. We provide mechanistic insight into how T7K weakens two such defense systems, Retron-Eco9 and DarTG1, through specific phosphorylation events, with single phosphomimetic mutations in key sites of the toxins abolishing defense. Finally, by screening a large collection of E. coli strains, we provide evidence of broad counter-defense capacities for T7K in nature, as strains counteracted contain diverse bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Understanding these interactions is vital as most early pregnancy loss occurs during this time. A major challenge in understanding uterine function and early pregnancy is lack of appropriate in-vitro models. Two-dimensional models are available, but do not recapitulate the endometriums complex multicellular structure. Here, we describe a hormonally responsive organoid model of the bovine endometrium, developed as a tool for studying endometrial function and early pregnancy. Bovine glandular epithelial cells were isolated from reproductive tracts and cultured in an extracellular matrix hydrogel (Cultrex 2) at 38.5{degrees}C, 5% CO (n=3). RNA was extracted and qPCR confirmed the presence of gland markers: leukemia inhibitory factor, mucin-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, kruppel-like factor-5 and forkhead box protein-A2. Organoids were imaged at specific time-points to monitor growth and passaged 3 times in 1:2 or 1:3 ratios after growing for a minimum of 10 days per passage. Morphologically, organoids were spherical and fast-growing at passages 0 and 1, but this declines following passage 2. Bovine endometrial organoids (n=3, passage 0) were treated with 1000 ng/ml recombinant ovine Interferon Tau (IFNT) or 10 g/ml progesterone (P4) for 24 hours and analysed by RNASeq to assess hormone responsiveness. Differential expression analysis by DeSeq2 negative binomial distribution model followed by Wald test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction identified 373 transcripts significantly upregulated (padj<0.05 or log2fold change >0.05) in response to P4 treatment, with downstream analysis showing significant overrepresentation (FDR<0.05) of genes associated with positive regulation of protein localisation to plasma membrane and cell periphery. Of the 240 genes significantly downregulated by P4 these were significantly overrepresented (FDR<0.05) in biological processes of cilium and cytoskeleton organisation. IFNT treatment resulted in significant upregulation of 414 genes and downregulation of 119 genes. The largest cluster associated with differentially expressed genes in response to IFNT is defence to virus and interferon signalling. There were 30 genes altered by both P4 treatment and IFNT treatment. Organoids were also shown to express conserved microRNAs, and it was possible to culture them in a microfluidics device - making them a useful model for a multitude of potential investigations. This model provides a tool to investigate bovine endometrial function and peri-implantation communication, subsequently allowing species comparison to understand diversity in reproductive strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

This affords the opportunity to reveal molecular principles that govern the pre-implantation stages of mammalian development. We leveraged a multipurpose allele for acute protein depletion and efficient immunoprecipitation to dissect the molecular functions of the chromatin repressor EHMT2, a candidate antagonist of the mESC-to-2CLC transition. This allowed us to define categories of EHMT2 target genes characterized by distinct modes of EHMT2 chromatin engagement and repression. Most notably, EHMT2 directly represses large clusters of co-regulated gene loci that comprise a significant fraction of the 2CLC-specific transcriptome by initiating H3K9me2 spreading from distal LINE-1 elements. EHMT2 counteracts the recruitment of the activator DPPA2/4 to promoter-proximal endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) at 2CLC genes. EHMT2 depletion elevates the expression of ZGA-associated transcripts in 2CLCs and synergizes with spliceosome inhibition and retinoic acid signaling in facilitating the mESC-to-2CLC transition. In contrast to ZGA-associated genes, repression of germ layer-associated transcripts by EHMT2 occurs outside of gene clusters in collaboration with ZFP462 and entails binding to non-repeat enhancers. Our observations show that EHMT2 attenuates the bidirectional differentiation potential of mouse pluripotent stem cells and define molecular modes for locus-specific transcriptional repression by this essential histone methyltransferase.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Accordingly, using language involves an interplay between unimodal brain areas that process sensory information and transmodal areas that respond to linguistic input regardless of the input modality (e.g., reading sentences vs. listening to speech). Previous work has shown that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC), when performed within individuals, can delineate a distributed language network that overlaps in detail with regions activated by a reading task. The network was widely distributed across multiple brain regions, recapitulating an organization that is characteristic of association cortex, and which suggests that the distributed language network serves transmodal, not unimodal, functions. Here, we tested whether the distributed language network encapsulates transmodal functions by assessing its degree of overlap with two language tasks, one auditory (i.e., listening to speech) and one visual (i.e., reading sentences). The results show that the distributed language network aligns well with regions activated by both tasks, supporting a transmodal function. Further, the boundaries of the distributed language network along the lateral temporal cortex serve as a good proxy for the division between transmodal language and auditory functions: presentation of sounds (i.e., filtered, incomprehensible speech) evoked activity that was largely outside of the distributed language network but closely followed the network boundaries. These findings support that individualized iFC estimates can delineate the division between sensory-linked and abstract linguistic functions. We conclude that within-individual iFC may be viable for language mapping in individuals with aphasia who cannot perform language tasks in the scanner.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, our understanding is limited as eukaryotic organisms beyond the animal, plant, and yeast lineages remain poorly understood. Recently, core meiotic genes have been identified in the genome of the model brown alga Ectocarpus, but currently lack proper characterization. Here, we combine bioinformatic, structural, and biochemical approaches to characterise the axial element orthologs, meiotic Ectocarpus HORMA domain protein (ecHOP1) and its interactor, reductional division protein 1 (ecRED1), in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of synaptonemal complex (SC) and double strand break (DSB) formation in brown algae. We highlight novel domain architecture within ecHOP1 and ecRED1 that support HORMA domain conformational switches and quantify the thermodynamic parameters of these interactions. Together, our data suggests that brown algae may employ alternative HORMA domain regulation mechanisms compared with animal, plant and yeast systems, and provide clues for future studies on the evolutionary constraints and adaptation of meiosis across the tree of life.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

While cyclic (oligo)nucleotides have emerged as key signaling molecules, the existence of other messengers remains largely unexplored. Here, we reveal a bacterial anti-phage system that mediates immune signaling through nucleobase modification. Immunity is triggered by phage nucleotide kinases, which, combined with the system-encoded adenosine deaminase, produce deoxyinosine 5'-triphosphate (dITP) as immune messengers. The dITP signal activates downstream effector to mediate cellular NAD+ depletion, resulting in population-level defense through the death of infected cells. To counteract immune signaling, phages deploy specialized enzymes that deplete cellular dAMP, the precursor of dITP messengers. Our findings uncover a nucleobase modification-based anti-phage signaling pathway, establishing noncanonical nucleotides as a new type of immune messengers in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, opioids are prone to side effects which limit their effectiveness as analgesics and can lead to opioid use disorders or, even, lethal overdose. The systemic administration of opioid agonists makes it both very difficult to decipher their underlying circuit mechanisms of action and to limit drug action to specific receptor subpopulations to isolate therapeutic effects from adverse side effects. Here we design, synthesize, and characterize a reversibly photoswitchable morphinan agonist termed azo-morphine-3 (AM-3) which interconverts from low to high efficacy in response to different wavelengths of light to enable optical control of MOR signaling. Cryo-EM structures of the low efficacy trans and high efficacy cis states of AM-3 bound to the MOR reveal distinct binding modes of the photoswitchable azobenzene moiety, each inducing unique structural dynamics, providing insight into the molecular basis of agonist efficacy. In mice, AM-3 drives reversible and repeatable optical control of anti-nociception with a reduced side effect profile owing to its restriction to the periphery and its ability to be locally activated at the site of pain.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, whether and to what degree L1 activity directly impacts genome integrity is unclear. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to experimental models of L1 expression to comprehensively define the spectrum of genomic changes caused by L1. We provide definitive evidence that L1 expression frequently and directly causes both local and long-range chromosomal rearrangements, small and large segmental copy-number alterations, and subclonal copy-number heterogeneity due to ongoing chromosomal instability. Mechanistically, all these alterations arise from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated by L1-encoded ORF2p. The processing of ORF2p-generated DSB ends prior to their ligation can produce diverse rearrangements of the target sequences. Ligation between DSB ends generated at distal loci can generate either stable chromosomes or unstable dicentric, acentric, or ring chromosomes that undergo subsequent evolution through breakage-fusion bridge cycles or DNA fragmentation. Together, these findings suggest L1 is a potent mutagenic force capable of driving genome evolution beyond simple insertions.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

The agreement between experimental and computed chemical shifts validated the X-ray structure as a reliable basis for detailed computational analyses.

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) isolate genes and their regulatory elements within the same topological neighborhood, avoiding crosstalk between regulatory elements. Perturbation of domain boundaries causes aberrant genomic contacts and gene expression misregulation. Architectural proteins such as CTCF and the cohesin complex are critical to form boundaries. However, we still lack a complete understanding of what makes a boundary more effective at insulating genomic contacts than others. To understand how domains are structured, we experimentally classified boundaries according to their chromatin accessibility as a proxy of protein occupancy in K562 human cells. We found that highly accessible boundaries are occupied by more proteins, are more robust contact insulators, have a more conserved CTCF DNA-binding motif and are more conserved across cell types in contrast to less accessible ones. By exploring the proteins enriched at boundaries with different accessibility, we found that CTCF and cohesin, together with REST, form a module, and ZFN316, together with EMSY, form another module, and both modules occupy boundaries very frequently. Finally, by using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genetic edition of ZNF316 DNA-binding motif at a robust domain boundary, we demonstrate that ZNF316 can block chromatin contacts in the absence of CTCF. Our results emphasize the importance of protein combination and abundance to support boundary strength and propose ZNF316 as a novel architectural protein.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Such a research paradigm has recently shown considerable promise in the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, while to date, efforts have centered on transcriptome. In contrast to gene expression, chromatin accessibility provides more decisive insights into cell states, shaping the chromatin regulatory landscapes that control transcription in distinct cell types. Yet, challenges also persist due to the abundance of features, high data sparsity, and the quasi-binary nature of these data. Here, we introduce EpiAgent, the first foundation model for single-cell epigenomic data, pretrained on a large-scale Human-scATAC-Corpus comprising approximately 5 million cells and 35 billion tokens. EpiAgent encodes chromatin accessibility patterns of cells as concise ""cell sentences,"" and employs bidirectional attention to capture cellular heterogeneity behind regulatory networks. With comprehensive benchmarks, we demonstrate that EpiAgent excels in typical downstream tasks, including unsupervised feature extraction, supervised cell annotation, and data imputation. By incorporating external embeddings, EpiAgent facilitates the prediction of cellular responses to both out-of-sample stimulated and unseen genetic perturbations, as well as reference data integration and query data mapping. By simulating the knockout of key cis-regulatory elements, EpiAgent enables in-silico treatment for cancer analysis. We further extended zero-shot capabilities of EpiAgent, allowing direct cell type annotation on newly sequenced datasets without additional training.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

CaCoFold-R3D uses evolutionary information present in an RNA alignment to reliably identify canonical helices (including pseudoknots) by covariation.

Tsuboyama et al. measured folding stability for 57,698 single amino acid insertion or deletion mutants in 405 small domains, and this analysis identified 103 stabilizing mutants ({triangleup}{triangleup}Gunfolding > 1 kcal/mol).

However, quantifying the flexibility of surface-tethered biomolecules in aqueous environments has been difficult due to a lack of experimental tools. Here we introduce SurFlex microscopy, a method based on fluorescence anisotropy that exploits the relationship between the conformational dynamics of a tethered molecule and the rotational diffusion of an attached fluorophore to extract information about molecular flexibility. By analyzing the polarization state of photons emitted after polarized excitation, we quantify apparent molecular flexibilities that include effects of tethering, self-interactions and buffer conditions. We first demonstrate the capabilities of SurFlex microscopy by measuring the flexibility of bilayer-tethered single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of different lengths and nucleotide sequences. We find that sequence significantly impacts ssDNA flexibility, consistent with theoretical estimates, with weak intramolecular interactions in random sequences leading to higher apparent stiffness. Interestingly, we show that a pathological DNA sequence linked to Huntingtons disease exhibits unusual flexibility despite intramolecular interactions. We next extend SurFlex microscopy to live cells by measuring surface glycoprotein flexibility on red blood cells using fluorescent lectins. We show that trypsinization decreases glycan fluctuations, demonstrating that modifications to the cell surface can alter the flexibility of remaining surface molecules. SurFlex microscopy provides a new tool for quantifying molecular flexibility that can be used to study the role of tethered surface molecules in fundamental biological processes.

Significance statementBiomolecules immobilized on one end play crucial roles in diverse cellular processes, from cell-cell signaling through surface receptors to the formation of DNA secondary structures. However, measuring biomolecular flexibility on surfaces has remained challenging. Here we present SurFlex microscopy, a technique that uses fluorescence anisotropy to quantify the flexibility of surface-anchored molecules. By analyzing the rotational dynamics of fluorophores attached to the ends of fluctuating biomolecules, SurFlex microscopy can be used to quantify persistence length. We demonstrate its capabilities by measuring sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA and crowding-dependent changes in glycan flexibility on native cell surfaces. This method opens new avenues for understanding how biomolecular flexibility influences key biological processes, such as those at cell surfaces during cell-cell contact formation and subsequent signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, most existing genetic studies have been based on short-read sequencing methods, which capture fewer than half of the SVs present in any one individual. Long-read sequencing (LRS) enhances our ability to detect disease-associated and functionally relevant structural variants (SVs); however, its application in large-scale genomic studies has been limited by challenges in sample preparation and high costs. Here, we leverage a new scalable wet-lab protocol and computational pipeline for whole-genome Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing and apply it to neurologically normal control samples from the North American Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (European ancestry) and Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) (African or African admixed ancestry) cohorts. Through this work, we present a publicly available long-read resource from 351 human brain samples (median N50: 27 Kbp and at an average depth of [~]40x genome coverage). We discover approximately 234,905 SVs and produce locally phased assemblies that cover 95% of all protein-coding genes in GRCh38. Utilizing matched expression datasets for these samples, we apply quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses and identify SVs that impact gene expression in post-mortem frontal cortex brain tissue. Further, we determine haplotype- specific methylation signatures at millions of CpGs and, with this data, identify cis-acting SVs. In summary, these results highlight that large-scale LRS can identify complex regulatory mechanisms in the brain that were inaccessible using previous approaches. We believe this new resource provides a critical step toward understanding the biological effects of genetic variation in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Direct force measurements reveal increased mechanical activity at the interface of the two competing cell types in the form of large stress fluctuations which can lead to upward forces and cell elimination. We show how a winning cell type endowed with a stronger intercellular adhesion exhibits a higher resistance to elimination while benefiting from efficient force transmission to neighboring cells. This cell elimination mechanism could have broad implications of keeping strong force transmission ability for maintaining tissue boundaries and cell invasion pathology.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Some protein language models have the capacity to encode dependencies between sites in conserved structural and functional domains across the protein universe. We employ the MSA Transformer, which takes a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as an input, and is trained with masked language modeling objectives, to investigate if and how effects of epistasis can be captured to enhance the analysis of phylogenetic relationships. We test whether the MSA Transformer internally encodes evolutionary distances between the sequences in the MSA despite this information not being explicitly available during training. We investigate the model's reliance on information available in columns as opposed to rows in the MSA, by systematically shuffling sequence content. We then use MSA Transformer on both natural and simulated MSAs to reconstruct entire phylogenetic trees with implied ancestral branchpoints, and assess their consistency with trees from maximum likelihood inference. We demonstrate how both previously known and novel evolutionary relationships are available from a ""non-classical"" approach with very different computational requirements, by reconstructing phylogenetic trees for the RNA virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus domain.

By learning semantic relationships across multiple genes, Evo enables a genomic ""autocomplete"" in which a DNA prompt encoding a desired function instructs the model to generate novel DNA sequences that can be mined for similar functions.

Strikingly, in-context protein design with Evo achieves potent activity and high experimental success rates even in the absence of structural hypotheses, known evolutionary conservation, or task-specific fine-tuning. We then use Evo to autocomplete millions of prompts to produce SynGenome, a first-of-its-kind database containing over 120 billion base pairs of AI-generated genomic sequences that enables semantic mining across many possible functions.

Consequently, melanoma cells must rapidly evolve to evade immune detection by simultaneously modulating cell-autonomous epigenetic mechanisms and tumor-microenvironment interactions. Angiogenesis has been implicated in this process; although an increase of vasculature initiates the immune response in normal tissue, solid tumors manage to somehow enhance blood flow while preventing immune cell infiltration. By comparing the expression of transcription factors (TFs) across early-stage melanoma, naevi, and other cancer types, we found the homeodomain-containing TF HOXD13 drives a melanoblast-like developmental program, which is upregulated in melanoma and strongly correlated with angiogenesis and immune cell exclusion. Using transcriptomics, 3D chromatin profiling, and in vivo models, we demonstrate that HOXD13 upregulation promotes tumor growth in vivo by concomitantly enhancing angiogenesis and suppressing T-cell infiltration. HOXD13 orchestrates 3D chromatin contacts between distal enhancers and promoters, simultaneously activating VEGFA, SEMA3A, and CD73. VEGFA and SEMA3A remodel the tumor vasculature and CD73 elevates extracellular levels of adenosine, a vasodilator and immune suppressor that binds adenosine receptors (AdR) on endothelial and T cells. In line with these findings, HOXD13-induced growth advantage in vivo was significantly reversed by the concomitant administration of VEGFR and AdR inhibitors. By revealing a dual pro-angiogenic and immunosuppressive HOXD13-CD73/VEGF gene regulatory axis, we identify a subset of patients who might benefit from combinations of AdR and VEGFR inhibitors which are both currently being tested in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

High sequence variability among viral xrRNAs raises questions about the shared molecular features that characterize this functional RNA class. Here, we present the first structure of a plant-virus xrRNA in its active exoribonuclease-resistant conformation. The xrRNA forms a 9 base pair pseudoknot that creates a knot-like topology similar to that of flavivirus xrRNAs, despite lacking sequence similarity. Biophysical assays confirm a compact pseudoknot structure in solution, and functional studies validate its relevance both in vitro and during infection. Our study reveals how viral RNAs achieve a common functional outcome through highly divergent sequences and identifies the knot-like topology as a defining feature of xrRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

While these species have led to countless breakthroughs in our understanding of infectious disease, there are undoubtably important biological processes that are missed by limiting studies to these two vertebrate species. For instance, it is well-established that a common North American deermouse, Peromyscus leucopus, has unique interactions with microbes, which likely shape its ability to serve as a critical reservoir for numerous zoonotic pathogens, including a Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. In this work, we expand the immunological toolkit to study P. leucopus biology by performing the first differentiation of deermouse bone marrow to macrophages using P. leucopus M-CSF producing HEK293T cells.

Characters from dental morphology, fin spines, and cranial bones are provided as taxonomic tools for the study of fossil fishes. All of the taxa are members of groups currently restricted to drainages east of the Andes, suggesting that physical drainage connection was still present by the Pliocene between the Amazon-Orinoco and trans-Andean drainages such as the Magdalena-Cauca, or that these groups persisted in the trans-Andean region at least until Pliocene times. The genera Hemidoras, Serrasalmus, and Trachelyopterichthys are new records for the fossil fish fauna of South America. The genus Zungaro represents a new record for the trans-Andean region, whereas the genus Platysilurus is for the first time in Colombia. Most of these occurrences also represent the youngest occurrences in the fossil record. Literature records are reidentified as Pygocentrus from the La Venta fauna and the earily Oligocene in Peru. These assemblages suggest that the Sincelejo and Ware formations were deposited in rivers of large size that were part of a large drainage network connected to the Amazon-Orinoco despite being currently located west of the Andes.

These eco-evolutionary dynamics are largely unexplored, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we hypothesize that such dynamics in the wake of the GOE explain the otherwise paradoxical evolutionary history of metal use in nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. This ancient metalloenzyme exists in three isozymes, with distinct metal cofactors. Recent research demonstrates that the most ancient isozyme, emerging a billion years or more before the GOE, required a molybdenum (Mo)-based cofactor. ""Alternative"" nitrogenases using iron (Fe) or vanadium (V) cofactors evolved after the GOE. This history is puzzling because Mo availability in the environment increased after the GOE, while Fe availability decreased, due to the contrasting environmental redox behaviors of these elements. Why, then, did the alternatives emerge only after the GOE? Using a simple model constrained by known microbial Mo quotas, we demonstrate that a strong selection pressure for use of metals in nitrogenase other than Mo is a likely consequence of competition between nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and nitrate-reducing microbes, which require Mo for nitrate reduction and assimilation. This competition would have intensified after the GOE due to increasing environmental availability of nitrate, explaining the evolutionary timing of the nitrogenase isozymes. Ecological resource competition therefore emerges as a third driver of metallome evolution in deep-time, alongside the relative environmental availabilities and adaptive advantages of particular metals.

Significance statementThe selection of metals in biochemical evolution is widely attributed to either the relative environmental availability of specific metals or their functional benefits in biological systems. We propose a third pressure, ecological resource competition, which is typically overlooked as a driver of molecular novelty in deep time. Specifically, we hypothesize that competition between Mo-dependent nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes and Mo-dependent nitrate reducers led to the emergence of Mo-free ""alternative"" nitrogenase enzymes during the early Proterozoic. This novel hypothesis explains the paradoxical emergence of alternative nitrogenases after the Great Oxidation Event despite increasing ocean Mo abundances at that time. Competition among microbial species for the same metals likely drove molecular innovations, especially in response to dynamically changing geochemical landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

However, no current computational model explains V4 responses under natural conditions. To address this, we developed a new hierarchical convolutional energy (HCE) model reflecting computations thought to occur in areas V1, V2, and V4, but which consists entirely of simple- and complex-like units like those found in V1. In contrast to prior models, the HCE model is trained end-to-end on neurophysiology data, without relying on pre-trained network features. We recorded 313 V4 neurons during full-color nature video stimulation and fit the HCE model to each neuron. The model's predicted optimal patterns (POPs) revealed complex spatiotemporal pattern selectivity in V4, supporting its role in representing space, time, and color. These findings indicate that area V4 is crucial for image segmentation and grouping operations that are essential for complex vision. Thus, responses of V4 neurons under naturalistic conditions can be explained by a hierarchical three-stage model where each stage consists entirely of units like those found in area V1.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Cereal aphids are small sap-feeding insects that infest cereals and vector devastating cereal pathogens, principally the yellow dwarf viruses, with severe infection reducing yields by 20-80%. Currently, farmers are advised to apply insecticide if a single cereal aphid is found within the crop. However, this is an oversimplification of the biology and ecology of the vector-virus system: Each aphid species can transmit a range of yellow dwarf virus species with variable efficiency, and intra-species diversity within a vector species (genotype) can influence this further. Accounting for this variation in decision-making processes has the potential to help with developing bespoke management options based on the composition of the local vector-virus population, and represents a novel avenue that could be explored to develop more sustainable management strategies. Here we describe a stage-structured model that can estimate vector dispersal and disease spread. We use data for the two main cereal aphid species and the two yellow dwarf virus species of greatest concern in Europe to examine how diversity at each level of the vector-virus system impacts disease spread. More broadly, our modelling framework represents a tool that can be used to explore vector-virus-host interactions in greater detail, and we use cereal systems as a case study. Our modelling scenarios highlight diversity at each scale as an important factor. We show that the two main vector species have contrasting dispersal patterns, and that this interacts with virus transmission efficacy to influence disease spread; genetic variation within a vector population is a key driver behind disease spread and disease risk; and for vector species that transmit multiple virus species, the specific vector-virus species combination is a key risk factor to consider.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

V1R-type olfactory receptors are highly conserved at the amino acid sequence level among teleost fish and believed to play a fundamental role in reproduction. Our previous studies have reported the unexpected sequence diversity of V1Rs among some cichlid species, implying the possible involvement of V1Rs in their speciation. In this study, we extensively investigated the process of the evolutionary diversification of all six V1Rs (V1R1 to V1R6) by utilizing the genome data from 528 cichlid species, covering almost all lineages. In V1R2, two highly divergent alleles (1.17%: variant sites/CDS length) without recombination were shared and maintained among the cichlids of all East African Great Lakes. In V1R6, large number of highly variable alleles that could be derived from the multiple recombination of two highly divergent alleles (1.39%: variant sites/CDS length) were shared among the cichlids of Lake Victoria. Additionally, we also identified highly divergent alleles in V1R1 within the tribe Tropheini, and in both V1R3 and V1R6 within Trematocarini and Ectodini. Given that one of the two divergent alleles of these V1Rs emerged so rapidly during cichlid evolution, they are likely to be derived from introgression. However, the source lineages for those introgressions were not identified despite the extensive exploration implying that they have already been extinct. This work provides compelling support for the contribution of introgression to explain striking diversity of V1Rs in East African cichlids.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Theory suggests the evolution of differentiation between life stages is facilitated by the expression of different genes at different points throughout ontogeny, which alleviates pleiotropic evolutionary constraints. Therefore, ascertaining what contributes to specialized patterns of gene expression across ontogeny is fundamental to understanding the evolution of ontogenetic complexity. Expression divergence between duplicate genes and gene organization on chromosomes have been identified as important features of relatively complex ontogenies. Therefore, one could predict that their link to transcriptional specialization across ontogeny may be weaker in relatively simpler life cycles. Here, we investigated the links between gene duplication, gene organization, and stage-specific patterns of expression across the relatively simple Caenorhabditis elegans life cycle. We found that signatures of stage-biased chromosomal regions were weaker in C. elegans than what has been previously described in organisms with more complex ontogenies. Furthermore, we found the extent that duplicate genes varied in ontogenetic expression pattern was more constrained in C. elegans. Overall, our findings add to a body of evidence that suggests a link between gene duplication and gene organization and the evolution of complex ontogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

To address these issues, we utilized a straightforward in vivo vascularized tumor modeling method with a completely degradable, crosslinker-free carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTS)/oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) hydrogel that encapsulates high-density human cancer cells for in situ injection. The CMCTS/oHA hydrogel was fully degraded within 3 weeks, enabling three-dimensional (3D) cell condensation in vitro. 2 weeks after subcutaneous injection in mice, solid tumors formed, with native host vasculature infiltrating the transplanted human cancer cells, confirming spontaneous hydrogel degradation. Following this, human macrophages were administered via tail vein injection, enhancing the accumulation of mouse immune cells in the humanized tumor twofold and showing murine macrophages adjacent to the vasculature. This study thus provides proof-of-concept for a facile and fully vascularized humanized tumor model in mice for validating immune cell therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

Here, we employ whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution in larval zebrafish, combined with anatomical and spatial genetic expression profile databases, to investigate the structural and genetic basis of functional brain networks. We show that mesoscopic functional connectivity (FC) is a robust measure of brain activity that captures the individuality of larvae. Using a public dataset of thousands of single-neuron reconstructions, we reveal a strong coupling between FC and structural connectivity (SC). Numerous properties of the connectome that account for indirect pathways and diffusion mechanisms individually and collectively predict interregional correlations. The hierarchical modular structure of SC and FC significantly overlaps in space, and modules identified within the connectome constrain the shape of both spontaneous and stimulus-driven activity patterns. Using visual stimuli and tail monitoring, we identify a functional network gradient that maps onto the sensorimotor function of brain regions. Finally, we identify a set of genes whose co-expression in brain regions significantly predicts regional FC.

However, stable circuit function and consistent expression of key inducible proteins are crucial for effective reprogramming, and DNA methylation-induced silencing hinders this stability. To address this issue, A2-ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (A2UCOE) have gained attention for their ability to maintain open chromatin and prevent methylation, thereby stabilizing gene expression. In this study, we aimed to forward program iPSCs into thymic epithelial cells (TECs) using a compact, all-in-one gene circuit composed of a doxycycline-inducible Tet-On system, 863-bp A2UCOE (0.9 UCOE), and FOXN1, a master transcription factor for TEC differentiation. This compact construct enables site-specific genome integration and stable inducible expression within iPSCs for renewably generating TECs. While the 0.9 UCOE promoted stable expression of constitutively expressed genes, it also caused unintended FOXN1 gene leakage, leading to unprogrammed gradual differentiation of the iPSCs. We generated A2UCOE fragments of varying lengths and found that gene leakage persisted regardless of fragment size. We tested spacer sequences between the A2UCOE and the Tet-On promoter consisting of varying AT-nucleotide content (35, 50, and 65%) and the 65% AT-rich SV40 poly-A terminator sequence and found that only the SV40 poly-A mitigated this leakage, and surprisingly, enhanced desired anti-silencing effects. These findings highlight the benefits and potential risks of using A2UCOE in iPSCs, and provides insights into a regulatory DNA architecture optimal for compact forward programming circuits for controlled iPSC differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

We investigated genetic differences between Holstein heifers with varying fertility potential and health. We carried out a genome-wide association analysis comparing heifers that conceived at first insemination against those requiring multiple attempts or failing to become pregnant, as well as heifers culled due to health issues. There were 12 significant SNPs (P<5x10-5) associated with fertility and 35 SNPs associated with health traits. There were 166 significant SNPs when infertile, sub-fertile and animals culled due to health issues were grouped. Two SNPs identified in the analysis of infertility were found near NUFIP1 and within TENM4 genes, both genes are linked to embryonic lethality in mouse knockouts. Follow-up CRISPR-Cas9 mediated disruption of NUFIP1 significantly (P<0.05) reduced in vitro blastocyst development in cattle embryos, while TENM4 editing did not alter in vitro blastocyst development. Additionally, SNPs overlapped with previously identified reproduction-related QTL (CNTN4, DLG2, PARP10, PRICKLE, TMEM150B) or health-related QTL (FAM162A, PARP10). We also identified genes within or near genes previously associated with age at menarche (CADM2, DLG2, FHIT, LSAMP and TENM4) or lung function or pulmonary diseases (ASCC2, BCAS3, BTBD9, CADM2, CNTN4, CPEB4, CTNNA2, DEUP1, DGKH, DLG2, ENOX1, EPHB1, ERC2, ERGIC1, EYA2, FAM162A, FGF18, FHIT, GRID1, KCNIP4, LINGO2, LRMDA, MALRD1, NEBL, PLA2G6, PLXDC2, PRPF18, SLC8A1, TEAD4, TSPAN9) in humans.

Diabetes increases the oxidative status of lipoproteins in nearly all tissues, including muscle tissues, but the role of lipid ROS on diabetes-induced muscle atrophy is not fully understood. Deuterium reinforced polyunsaturated fatty acids (D-PUFA) are more resistant to ROS-initiated chain reaction of lipid peroxidation than regular hydrogenated PUFA (H-PUFA). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that D-PUFA would protect muscle atrophy induced by diabetes driven by an accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH). C57BL/6J mice were dosed with H-PUFA or D-PUFA for four weeks through dietary supplementation and then injected with streptozotocin (STZ) to induce insulin-deficient diabetes. After two weeks, muscles tissues were analyzed for individual muscle mass, force generating capacity and cross-sectional area. Skeletal muscle fibers from diabetic mice exhibited increased total ROS and LOOH. This was abolished by the D-PUFA supplementation regardless of accumulated iron. D-PUFA were found to be protective against muscle atrophy and weakness from STZ-induced diabetes. Prevention of muscle atrophy and weakness by D-PUFA might be independent of ACSL4/LPCAT3/15-LOX pathway. These findings provide novel insights into the role of LOOH in the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and diabetic myopathy and suggest a novel therapeutic approach to diabetes-associated muscle weakness.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

The emergence of new variants has increased the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect species that were not susceptible to the ""original"" SARS-CoV-2, such as mice and rats.

This work attempted to evaluate the role of urban rats in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission by combining surveillance studies of rat populations in urban environments, in vivo experimental inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 and comparative viral-receptor interaction in silico analyses.

We studied the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in wild Rattus norvegicus (n=401) captured in urban areas and sewage systems of several French cities. Except for 3 inconclusive samples (2/75 from Bordeaux and 1/261 from Lyon) none of the 353 sera tested showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by microsphere immunoassay. However, the 3 inconclusive sera samples were negative by virus neutralisation assay. No SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in all lungs collected from the 401 captured urban brown rats. In complement, four rat groups (two wild-type colonies, Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus, and two laboratory strains, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar) were inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5. At 4 days post-inoculation, no infectious viral particles were detected in the lungs and upper respiratory tract (URT) while viral RNA was detected at a low level only in the URT of all groups. In addition, seroconversion was observed 14 days after inoculation in the four groups. By molecular modelling, the Omicron BA.5 receptor binding domain (RBD) had lower affinities for Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus ACE2 than Homo sapiens ACE2.

Based on these results the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.5 was unable to infect laboratory and wild type rats. In addition, Rattus norvegicus collected for this study in different areas of France were not infected with SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

By screening 10 million eukaryotic proteins, we identified several domains that define multi-copy gene families and frequently co-occur with TE/viral domains. Among these, a Tc1/Mariner transposase helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain was captured by F-box genes in the Caenorhabditis genus, creating a new class of F-box genes. For specific members of this class, like fbxa-215, we found that the HTH domain is required for diverse processes including germ granule localisation, fertility, and thermotolerance. Furthermore, we provide evidence that HSF-1 mediates the transcriptional integration of fbxa-215 into the heat-shock response by binding to Helitron TEs directly upstream of the fbxa-215 locus. The interactome of HTH-bearing F-box factors suggests roles in post-translational regulation and proteostasis, consistent with established functions of F-box proteins. Based on AlphaFold2 multimer proteome-wide screens, we propose that the HTH domain may diversify the repertoire of protein substrates that F-box factors regulate post-translationally. We further demonstrate that F-box genes repeatedly and independently captured TE domains throughout eukaryotic evolution, and describe an additional instance in zebrafish. In conclusion, we identify recurrent TE domain captures by F-box genes in eukaryotes and provide insights into how these novel proteins are integrated within host gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318252

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1734905318252

Using the golden hamster as a model, we provide further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is neuroinvasive and can persist in the central nervous system, as we found viral RNA and replicative virus in the brainstem after 80 days of infection. Infected hamsters presented a neurodegenerative signature in the brainstem, with overexpression of innate immunity genes, impacted dopaminergic and glutamatergic synapses, altered energy metabolism. Finally, the infected hamsters manifested persistent signs of depression and impaired short-term memory, as well as late-onset signs of anxiety, as a valuable model to study long Covid.

As such early identification of emerging bacterial strains capable of rapidly evolving AMR is key. Although antimicrobial tolerance and persistence are precursor phenotypes for AMR, little evidence exists to support their importance in real-world settings. Here we used bacterial genome wide association on national genomic surveillance data of the diarrhoeal pathogen Shigella sonnei (n=3745) to agnostically identify common genetic signatures among lineages convergently evolving toward AMR (n=15). This revealed an association of an AMR trajectory with a multi- and highly variable second copy of metG, borne by a phage-plasmid we called pWPMR2. Further analyses revealed that pWPMR2 was present across clinically relevant enteric pathogens globally, including past and contemporary outbreaks, and that the additional-metG mechanism was present across multiple bacterial phyla. Functional microbiology, experimental evolution, and single-cell physiology studies confirmed that the expression of auxiliary metG, particularly the mutated version on pWPMR2, created a sub population of persister cells predisposed to survival in, and evolving resistance against, third generation cephalosporins. Thus, we demonstrate a novel mechanism of auxiliary metG carriage that predisposes bacteria to AMR with real world impacts. Furthermore, our approach is a timely example of using genomic epidemiology to rapidly guide functional microbiology studies in the era of routine genomic surveillance, and also highlights several deficiencies in current AMR surveillance practices.","NA","medrxiv",1734905318252

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole.

A popular method to generate surrogate maps with preserved spatial autocorrelation is the spin test. Here we show that a key component of the procedure -- projecting brain maps to a spherical surface -- distorts distance relationships between vertices. These distortions result in surrogate maps that imperfectly preserve spatial autocorrelation, yielding inflated false positive rates. We then confirm that targeted removal of individual spins with high distortion reduces false positive rates.

The whooping crane (Grus americana) experienced severe population declines in the 18th century, culminating into a collapse to 16 individuals in 1941. Legal protections and conservation actions have since increased the population to approximately 840 individuals, yet the impact on genomic diversity remains unclear. We analysed the temporal dynamics of genomic erosion by sequencing a high-quality genome reference, and re-sequencing 16 historical and 37 modern genomes, including wild individuals and four generations of captive-bred individuals. Genomic demographic reconstructions reveal a steady decline, accelerating over the past 300 years with the European settlement of North America. Temporal genomic analyses show that despite demographic recovery, the species has lost 70% of its genetic diversity and has increased their inbreeding. Although the modern population bottleneck reduced the ancestral genetic load, modern populations possess more realized load than masked load, possibly resulting in a chronic loss of fitness. Integrating pedigree and genomic data, we underscore the role of breeding management in reducing recent inbreeding. Yet ongoing heterozygosity loss, load accumulation, and background inbreeding argues against the species downlisting from their current Endangered status on the IUCN Red List and the Endangered Species Act. The presence of private genetic variation in wild and captive populations suggests that wild-captive crosses could enhance genetic diversity and reduce the realized load.

To date, almost all megaphages have evaded cultivation, with only phage G being in active culture for over 50 years. We examined with multiomics this five decades long cultivated history from nine different laboratories with five different lab variants to the modern era. In this work, we resolved the five complete phage G genomes, the particle proteome, de novo methylome, and used artificial intelligence (AI) to annotate the genome of phage G. Phage G is one of the largest phages with a size of >0.6 {micro}m, about half the width of the host cell, and a 499 kbp, non-permuted, linear genome that has, uniquely among known phages, two pairs of ends. Its closest known relative is Moose phage W30-1 which was metagenomically assembled without cultivation from a moose rumen sample. Phage G has >650 protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs), with >65% being hypothetical proteins with no known function, with the rest of the genome geared towards nucleic acid replication (e.g., helicases, polymerases, endonucleases) and are structural in nature (e.g., capsid, tail, portal, terminase). The genome encodes a 35 kbp stretch with 66 ORFs without any known functional homology, a cryptic genomic region that is roughly the size of phage lambda. Phage G has an expansive repertoire of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) acquired from its bacterial host, including a phoH,ftsZ,UvsX/RecA-like, gyrA, gyrB,and DHFR. Furthermore, AMGs discovered in phage G could manipulate host sporulation (sspD, RsfA, spoK) and antiviral escape genes (e.g., anti-CBass nuclease and Anti-Pycsar protein). Phage proteomics found >15% of the protein ORFs were present in either the wild-type or mutant variants of phage G, including genes involved in replication (e.g.,UvsX/RecA-like), host sporulation, as well as structural genes (e.g., capsid, tail, portal). The methylome of phage G was localized to the cryptic region with limited functional homology, with supervised machine learning (i.e., HMMs) was unable to resolve this region, but was resolved with protein structural AI. This cryptic region was a hot spot for methylation at 32%, where many of the functions of the ORF are still unknown. Our study represents a doorway into the complexity of the genomic repertoire of the only cultivated megaphage, highlighting five decades of continuous cultivation for the first time.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

However, the high cost of NA fluorometers presents a barrier to eDNA sequencing in resource limited settings (RLSs). For instance, at ~$1.5-3.3k USD, current NA fluorometers present a greater capital cost than ONT's $1k USD portable MinION third-generation Nanopore sequencing platform. The collapse of international scientific device and consumable supply chains during the COVID-19 pandemic also highlighted the need for distributed manufacturing of molecular research tools to mitigate the impact of increased pricing to RLSs. To address these challenges, we have developed the ""DIYNAFLUOR"" (DIY Nucleic Acid FLUORometer), a portable, open-source, <$40 USD NA fluorometer, designed using readily available off-the-shelf components, simple 3D-printed parts, and plug-and-play, solder-free assembly. The DIYNAFLUOR was primarily designed to be compatible with the popular DNA-centric Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) and Broad Range (BR) assay kits. Notably, the DIYNAFLUOR demonstrated an 'in-assay' Limit of Detection with the Qubit HS kit of 0.0028 ng/uL, and an average absolute bias of 0.018 ng/muL across a 0-10 ng/uL working range using a 2-point linear calibration methodology. Device verification was performed by comparative measurements with a Qubit 4 fluorometer in a busy biotechnology laboratory, and build instructions were validated through assembly and qualification of three DIYNAFLUOR devices by researchers outside the primary design team. We also describe a custom ""extreme"" low-cost assay, < 13 cent USD per-measurement, that uses SYBR Safe dye to quantify DNA across a working range of 0-0.5 ng/uL. This assay reports a lower sensitivity and accuracy than commercial kits but may be of use to RLSs in times of extreme resource constraints or as a teaching tool for STEM educators. To demonstrate its practical application for field-based eDNA analysis in RLSs, the DIYNAFLUOR was used to perform all quality control measurements throughout the preparation of a 16S and 18S metabarcoding library generated from eDNA extracted from Australian lake water, leading to the successful identification of Australian fauna via Nanopore sequencing. Finally, configurations of the DIYNAFLUOR for RNA and Protein quantification are briefly described.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

Although these methods are conceptually similar, we show by analyzing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: 1) trait importance -- how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and 2) trait specificity -- a genes importance for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, while burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, while burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

Nonlinear Hawkes process models can capture a large range of spiking dynamics, but remain difficult to interpret, due to their discontinuous and stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel framework based on a piecewise deterministic Markov process representation of the nonlinear Hawkes process (NH-PDMP) followed by a diffusion approximation. We analytically derive stability conditions and dynamical properties of the obtained diffusion processes for single-neuron and network models. We established the accuracy of the diffusion approximation framework by comparing it with exact continuous-time simulations of the original neuronal NH-PDMP models. Our framework offers an analytical and geometric account of the neuronal dynamics repertoire captured by nonlinear Hawkes process models, both for the canonical responses of single-neurons and neuronal-network dynamics, such as winner-take-all and traveling wave phenomena. Applied to human and nonhuman primate recordings of neuronal spiking activity during speech processing and motor tasks, respectively, our approach revealed that task features can be retrieved from the dynamical landscape of the fitted models. The combination of NH-PDMP representations and diffusion approximations thus provides a novel dynamical analysis framework to reveal single-neuron and neuronal-population dynamics directly from models fitted to spiking data.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

Specifically, we focused on hyperconnected 3D regulatory hubs and demonstrated that hub-interacting genes exhibit high and coordinated expression at the single-cell level and strong association with oncogenic programs that distinguish IDH-wt glioblastoma patients from low-grade glioma. Epigenetic silencing of a recurrent 3D enhancer hub--with an uncharacterized role in glioblastoma--was sufficient to cause concordant downregulation of multiple hub-connected genes along with significant shifts in transcriptional states and reduced clonogenicity. By integrating published datasets from other cancer types, we also identified both ''universal '' and cancer type-specific 3D regulatory hubs which enrich for varying oncogenic programs and nominate specific factors associated with worse outcomes. Genetic alterations, such as focal duplications, could explain only a small fraction of the detected hyperconnected hubs and their increased activity.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1734905318253

This study aims to explore how pesticide exposure disrupts key brain regions involved in Parkinson's disease pathology by reshaping gene regulatory landscapes. Using the well-established rotenone rat model of the disease, we performed H3K27ac ChIP-sequencing to profile active regulatory elements in the substantia nigra and cortex. In this model, rotenone distributes uniformly throughout the brain, and the degree of complex I inhibition is equivalent in cortical and substantia nigra neurons. Despite the uniformity of complex I inhibition, we identified widespread epigenomic differences, with brain region specific acetylation patterns associated with rotenone exposure. We showed consistent changes in transcriptomic activity by RNA-sequencing. Our results indicate there is a strong immune response to rotenone localised to the substantia nigra and highlight an enrichment of immune-related motifs in this brain region, suggesting that the immune response is at least partially driven by gene regulatory mechanisms. We also noted an increase in C1q complement pathway activity in the substantia nigra. In contrast, we identified widespread dysregulation of synaptic function at the gene regulatory level in the cortex of these same rats. Our results highlight a role for gene regulatory mechanisms potentially mediating the effects of pesticide exposure, driving region-specific functional responses in the brain that may contribute to the pathology and selective vulnerability that characterise Parkinson's disease.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer. The theory produces quantitative estimates useful to interpret experimental observations, and supports the idea that axo-axonic cells can potentially exert powerful inhibitory control on action potential initiation.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

StayGold, a novel dimeric green fluorescent protein recently monomerised through sequence engineering, addresses this challenge with its high photostability. There is now focus on producing different colour StayGold derivatives to facilitate concurrent tagging of multiple targets. The unnatural amino acid 3-aminotyrosine has previously been shown to red-shift super folder GFP upon incorporation into its chromophore via genetic code expansion. Here we apply the same strategy to red-shift StayGold through substitution of Tyrosine-58 with 3-aminotyrosine. The resultant red fluorescent protein, StayRose, shows 530 nm excitation and 588 nm emission peaks, shifting from the 497 nm and 504 nm excitation and emission peaks of StayGold. StayRose also retains the favourable photostability of StayGold and can be similarly monomerised using mutations at the dimer interface. A high-resolution crystal structure of StayRose confirms the modified structure of the amino-chromophore within an unperturbed 3D fold. Although reliant on genetic code expansion, StayRose provides an important step towards developing red-shifted StayGold derivatives.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

Mormon Fritillary butterflies (Speyeria mormonia) exhibit a striking wing color polymorphism throughout their range: typical morphs bear silver spots on their ventral surfaces, and can co-occur with unsilvered morphs displaying a dull coloration1. Through genome-wide association studies in two polymorphic populations, we fine-map this difference in silvering to the 3 region of the transcription factor gene optix. The expression of optix is confined to the unsilvered regions that surround the spots, and these patterns are transformed to a silver identity upon optix RNAi knockdown, implicating optix as a repressor of silver scales in this butterfly. We show that the unsilvered optix haplotype shows signatures of recent selective sweeps, and that this allele is shared with the monomorphic, unsilvered species Speyeria hydaspe, suggesting that introgressions facilitate the exchange of variants of adaptive potential across species. Remarkably, these findings parallel the role of introgressions and cis-regulatory modulation of optix in shaping the aposematic red patterns of Heliconius butterflies2-7, a lineage that separated from Speyeria 45 million years ago8. The genetic basis of adaptive variation can thus be more predictable than often presumed, even for traits that appear divergent across large evolutionary distances.

Unfortunately, clinical responses remain limited due to rapid resistance onset. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional inhibition. However, there is limited mechanistic understanding of KRAS degradation in vivo. Here, we developed a preclinical LUAD mouse model and demonstrated that targeted oncogenic KRAS degradation induces rapid tumor regression. Transcriptional, histological, and immunophenotypic analyses revealed a substantial remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. Notably, disease relapse observed during long-term degrader treatment stems from proteolysis machinery dysregulation, indicating resistance mechanisms distinct from those reported upon KRAS inhibition. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of KRAS degradation in LUAD, offering insights into cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms driving durable antitumor responses and supporting further clinical exploration.

Gastruloid axial elongation exhibits active cellular contractility, requires planar cell polarity (PCP), adhesion and cell-cell contact remodelling. Smaller gastruloids initiate elongation earlier, correlated with an earlier Brachyury polarisation. Brachyury expression increases tissue fluidity. Axis formation is regulated by the balance of Brachyury multifoci coalescence and the timing of initiation of the elongation programme. Sizes beyond the robust range can modify relative tissue composition.

The intervention of human modeling leads to the possibility that within a single structure, there can be differences in how well parts of a structure are modeled and/or fit the underlying experimental data. We identified that small molecule binding sites are more carefully modeled and better match the underlying experimental data than the rest of the protein structural model.

In addition, the ability to capture spatial information of kinase activity is crucial to deconvolute complex signaling networks, interrogate multifaceted kinase actions, and assess drug effects or genetic perturbations. Here we developed a proteomic kinase activity sensor platform (ProKAS) for the analysis of kinase signaling using mass spectrometry. ProKAS is based on a tandem array of peptide sensors with amino acid barcodes that allow multiplexed analysis for spatial, kinetic, and screening applications. We engineered a ProKAS module to simultaneously monitor the activities of the DNA damage response kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 in response to genotoxic drugs, while also uncovering differences between these signaling responses in the nucleus, cytosol, and replication factories. Furthermore, we developed an in silico approach for the rational design of specific substrate peptides expandable to other kinases. Overall, ProKAS is a novel versatile system for systematically and spatially probing kinase action in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

However, repetitive sequences and complex structural variation pose significant challenges for large-scale characterization. Here, we introduce a method using Oxford Nanopore ultra-long sequencing and adaptive sampling, coupled with a bioinformatic pipeline, to generate haplotype-resolved single-contig IGH assemblies. We compared our method to a well-established IGH characterization framework using Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing in four donors and observed almost complete sequence congruence between our haplotype-resolved assemblies and the HiFi reads. Applying our approach to the HG002 reference material revealed no base differences to the Telomere-to-Telomere genome benchmark over the IGH locus. Importantly, among the four donors, our approach uncovered 30 novel alleles and previously uncharacterized large structural variants, including a 120 kb segmental duplication spanning IGHE to IGHA1 and an expanded seven-copy IGHV3-23 gene haplotype.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253

Here we present the structures of full-length human adult receptors in complex with Fab35 in -bungarotoxin (BuTx)-bound resting states, and in acetylcholine (ACh)-bound desensitised states. In addition to identifying the conformational changes during recovery from desensitisation, we also used electrophysiology to probe the effects of eight previously unstudied AChR genetic variants found in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) patients, revealing they cause either slow- or fast-channel CMS characterised by prolonged or abbreviated ion channel bursts. The combined kinetic and structural data offer a better understanding of both AChR state transition and the pathogenic mechanisms of disease variants.","NA","biorxiv",1734905318253
