In arbitrium, the AimP peptide binds its cognate AimR receptor to repress aimX expression, promoting lysogeny. It has been assumed that each AimR responds exclusively to its own AimP. Here, we question this view by demonstrating cross-communication between distinct arbitrium systems. Using prototypical arbitrium phages, we demonstrate that AimP peptides bind and repress unrelated AimR receptors, promoting lysogeny and reducing prophage induction. Structural and binding assays reveal conserved residues enabling cross-recognition while preserving specificity. In mixed lysogenic cultures, these interactions shape induction outcomes, demonstrating ecological relevance. We extent these findings to infection contexts, showing that arbitrium signalling influences outcomes in cells harbouring prophages with compatible communicating systems. These findings reveal that phages engage in cross-species communication, a trait restricted to more complex life forms, challenging our understanding of how these elements reshape microbial communities.","[{""name"":""Spanish Government (Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovaciÃ³n)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2022-137201NB-I00;""},{""name"":""Valencian Government"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CIPROM/2023/30;""},{""name"":""European Commission NextGenerationEU fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""(EU 2020/2094);""},{""name"":""European Research Council grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101118890 (TalkingPhages);""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council (UK)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/X020223/1;MR/M003876/1;MR/V000772/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC, UK)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V002376/1;BB/V009583/1;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, UK)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X026671/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a 'temporal microscope', while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost-efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors' and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors' exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to ~35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,720 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity Mcl-1 binder reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

The pyrenoid, an algal biomolecular condensate that mediates one-third of global CO2 fixation, typically exists as one large condensate per chloroplast, but during cell division it transiently dissolves and reconfigures into multiple smaller condensates. Here, we identify a kinase, KEY1, in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that regulates pyrenoid condensate size and number dynamics throughout the cell cycle and is necessary for normal pyrenoid function and growth. Unlike wild type, key1 mutant cells have multiple smaller condensates throughout the cell cycle that fail to dissolve during cell division. We show that KEY1 localizes to the condensates and promotes their dissolution by disrupting interactions between their core constituents, the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco and its linker protein EPYC1, through EPYC1 phosphorylation. We develop a biophysical model that recapitulates KEY1-mediated condensate size and number regulation and suggests a mechanism for controlling condensate position. These data provide a foundation for the mechanistic understanding of the regulation of size, number, position, and dissolution in pyrenoids and other biomolecular condensates.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MCB-1935444;MCB-2410354;MCB-1914989;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-SC0020195;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01GM140032-01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health grant NIH-NINDS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2R01NS089729;""},{""name"":""Ruth L.

Prevalence estimates can inform public health investment, identify communities with high disease burden or underdiagnosis, and reveal areas of unmet clinical need. With the advent of global-scale biobanks, genetics-based models to estimate the prevalence of disease have become viable. Autosomal recessive (AR) rare diseases are particularly tractable for this approach given that disease prevalence can be estimated from the pathogenic allele frequency (AF) in carriers from unaffected populations. Despite the usefulness of such estimates, this approach has not been validated against real-world clinical datasets at scale. Newborn screening (NBS) programs, which test newborns for a panel of neonatal diseases using quantitative diagnostic methods, provide a comparator for birth prevalence with low ascertainment bias, large sample size, and low diagnostic variability. NBS datasets thus offer a uniquely robust benchmark to evaluate and improve the accuracy of AR genetic prevalence models. Here we explore the feasibility, utility, and pitfalls of estimating AR birth prevalence using genetic and NBS data. We applied a genetic model to estimate birth prevalence for 28 AR diseases consistently present on NBS panels and benchmarked these against reported NBS birth prevalence in more than 12 million newborns in the United States. We found concordance between the genetic estimate and NBS was impacted by the population database used to derive AF, ancestry-matching methodology, and pathogenic variant inclusion criteria. Incorporating these refinements, we demonstrate that a genetics-first approach can provide order-of-magnitude estimates of AR disease birth prevalence for nearly all tested diseases (25/28; 89%). However, we note a general underestimate of the genetic prevalence, suggesting identifying additional pathogenic variants would improve the concordance with NBS. Further, we also assessed the impact of epidemiological and genetic variables, highlighting diseases where genetic prevalence estimates may not be suitable.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760479831324

Tropical environments are undergoing intense rates of environmental change, and these changes may be driving large declines in genetic diversity. However, data on genetic diversity are highly skewed towards temperate regions. The degree to which diversity loss has occurred in tropical species, particularly marine species, remains an open and important question. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and museum collections of two commercially-harvested nearshore marine fishes (Equulites laterofenestra and Gazza minuta) gathered from a single location in the Philippines, spanning a century of intense environmental change. These data reveal a marked loss in genetic diversity and evidence for multiple orders of magnitude reductions in effective population size (Ne) in both species, indicating substantial genomic erosion. Such a decline highlights the long-lasting genomic consequences of anthropogenic activity and sheds light on an, until-now, invisible loss of diversity from the most biodiverse ocean region.

Significance StatementRecent reports have shown that genetic diversity in marine fishes has declined either slightly or not at all during the Anthropocene. However, almost all studies investigating marine genetic diversity loss have been from temperate latitudes, whereas tropical marine environments experience some of the most intense human impacts. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and historical specimens of two commercially-harvested fishes from the Philippines. We show that marine species in the tropics have already lost substantial genetic diversity and may have undergone severe bottlenecks over the past century. These results shine a light on the previously invisible loss of genetic diversity in the most biodiverse region of the ocean, and they emphasize the evolutionary consequences of the Anthropocene.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OISE-1743711;DEB-2343787;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Many cytoplasmic RNA viruses also harbor poly(A) tails on their genomic RNA and mRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infection causes cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) activity to become limiting, which preferentially destabilizes short-tailed host mRNAs, occurring before the action of virally encoded mRNA-decay factor nsp1. In this environment hostile to poly(A) tails, viral RNAs maintain a narrow tail-length distribution centering on 70-80 nucleotides across infection cycles. They do this through two mechanisms. First, viral tails are extended during RNA synthesis within double-membrane vesicles; second, viral tails are capped by a complex that includes PABPC1 and CSDE1 and slows tail shortening. Our findings suggest poly(A)-tail length is an arena of host- virus conflict, in which preserving tail lengths of viral mRNAs promotes their cytoplasmic dominance.

C_LIO_LIWe investigated anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, the second-largest fruit and vegetable family, characterised by white and yellow flowers and red, orange, and green fruits predominantly pigmented by carotenoids. Using a comprehensive collection of 258 datasets representing species across all 15 tribes of Cucurbitaceae and a phylogenomics approach, we observed a systematic absence of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Absence of the structural genes DFR, ANS, arGST, LAR, and ANR, along with the anthocyanin-related regulatory MYB genes, was consistently confirmed by synteny and phylogenetic analysis.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that anthocyanin loss in angiosperms is more common than previously assumed. In light of this new discovery, we propose a stepwise loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, likely accompanied by a partial functional replacement with carotenoid pigmentation.

Here, we identify that some of these immune response are differentially executed in leaves of different ages in the same plant. We observed that when compared to mature leaves, young, expanding leaves do not close their plasmodesmata, have a reduced transcriptional response to immune elicitors, and are more susceptible to a bacterial pathogen. Disconnecting leaf age from physiology, we determined that both plasmodesmal closure and the magnitude of transcriptional responses are dependent on whether the leaf is a carbon sink or a carbon source. To probe the relevance of differential regulation of plasmodesmata in sink and source tissues, we forced plasmodesmal closure in young sink leaves and found this perturbed the normal outputs of growth and defence. Thus, we propose that sink leaves do not close their plasmodesmata during immune reponses to prioritise carbon use for growth over defence, and consequently that primary metabolism underpins different immune response profiles in different leaves of the same plant.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""725459;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X010996/1;BB/X007685/1;BB/Y008782/1;BB/X016056/1;""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Rotation PhD Studentship;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

The surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), a group of 83 species across 6 genera, show high diversity in head, body, and propulsive fin (caudal and pectoral) shape, suggesting that morphometric analysis of these functionally relevant traits may provide insight into the ecomorphology and evolutionary history of this important fish family. Here, we develop a new multi-locus, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for the surgeonfishes based on 19 loci for 80 acanthurid species and 45 outgroups. Detailed head, body, and fin geometric morphometric data were collected for all 80 surgeonfish species in the tree, and patterns of shape evolution across the family were visualized using phylomorphospaces. We used a three-state feeding trait axis across the herbivore to planktivore continuum to examine how morphometric shape relates to diet. Head and body shape were significantly associated with diet. Additionally, species exhibited two alternative locomotor strategies: high aspect ratio (AR) tails were associated with low AR pectoral fins, slender bodies, and pelagic planktivory, whereas species with low AR tail fins had wing-like, high AR pectoral fins, deeper bodies, and were mostly benthic grazers. Using a novel phylogenetic comparative method to investigate evolutionary correlations between shapes, we found that the caudal fin had the highest evolutionary rates and covaried with both the body and pectoral fin, likely due to dietary and locomotor demands, respectively.

This study aims to explore the mechanisms underpinning such adaptability through a comprehensive genomic analysis of 22 isolates of A. johnsonii from NASAs Payload Hazardous Servicing Facility (PHSF) and one carbapenem-resistant strain (E154408A) from patient colonization in Ireland. Core-genome phylogeny revealed clustering of PHSF-originating isolates in a monophyletic clade divergent from the main species lineage. Species-wide virulence-associated genes and metabolic profiling indicated the unique presence in PHSF-originating isolates of two complete efflux pumps and of a conserved allantoin racemase, suggesting adaptability for multiple environmental stresses. Observed ubiquity of blaOXA in investigated genomes (n=112) and phenotypically-validated multidrug-resistant profile of E154408A strain highlight A. johnsoniis potential as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reservoir. Plasmidome analysis suggested gain/loss events across the monophyletic population and potential AMR acquisition pathways. Genome-to-metagenome mapping identified genomic signatures of A. johnsonii in PHSF >10 years post initial isolation.

ImportanceAcinetobacter johnsonii is increasingly recognized as an emerging human pathogen, with growing evidence of its ability to persist in controlled, high-stakes environments, posing risks as both persisting environmental contaminant and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) reservoir. Yet, gaps remain in our understanding of its AMR profile and the mechanisms that enable its enhanced environmental adaptability. This knowledge is necessary in contexts where biological cleanliness is a priority such as clinical settings and spacecraft assembly facilities cleanrooms, where contamination of hardware with terrestrial microorganisms is concerning. In this study, we aim to address some of key knowledge gaps by providing genomic insights into a rare multi-drug resistant clinical isolate and 22 NASA cleanroom isolates that persisted for over a decade in extremely clean conditions. Our findings will help evaluate the contamination risk of A. johnsonii in high-stakes environments and ultimately strengthen our ability to manage this microbial contaminant across terrestrial and extraterrestrial settings.

Using 60 years of life-history data from over 83,000 individuals, and historical daily climate records, we show that developmental stages in wild great tits (Parus major) differ in their sensitivity to extreme climatic events (ECEs). Exposure to extreme cold events during the first week of development is particularly detrimental to fledging mass, while extreme rain events have a stronger negative impact as chicks grow older and their energetic requirements increase. Synergistic effects of ECEs and average climatic conditions can be particularly severe, exacerbating the challenges faced by these birds. Our findings indicate that combined exposure to extreme heat and heavy rainfall during early development is associated with a predicted reduction in fledging mass by up to 27%. Additionally, birth timing may further modulate these effects, since late-season broods exposed to frequent hot ECEs during early development are predicted to fledge nestlings up to 4.27 standard deviations (35%) lighter than broods laid earlier in the season. Moreover, phenotypic plasticity has enabled many similar populations to shift towards an overall earlier laying date, which may have increased susceptibility to cold extremes during development. However, our analyses suggest that the benefits of being part of an early-laid clutch within a season may, to some extent, offset the negative effects of extreme climate on fledging mass and apparent survival. In climate scenarios where ECEs are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity, these developmental stage-specific insights are crucial for understanding how climate change may be influencing wild avian populations.","[{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/K006274/1;NE/S010335/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/L006081/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Circular megabase-sized ecDNAs lack centromeres and segregate stochastically during cell division yet persist over many generations. EcDNAs were first observed to hitchhike on mitotic chromosomes into daughter cell nuclei over 40 years ago with unknown mechanism. Here we identify a family of human genomic elements, termed retention elements, that tether episomes to mitotic chromosomes to increase ecDNA transmission to daughter cells. We develop Retain-seq, a genome-scale assay that reveals thousands of human retention elements conferring generational persistence to heterologous episomes. Retention elements comprise a select set of CpG-rich gene promoters and act additively. Live-cell imaging and chromatin conformation capture show that retention elements physically interact with mitotic chromosomes at regions which are mitotically bookmarked by transcription factors and chromatin proteins, intermolecularly recapitulating promoter-enhancer interactions. Multiple retention elements are co-amplified with oncogenes on individual ecDNAs in human cancers and shape their sizes and structures. CpG-rich retention elements are focally hypomethylated; targeted cytosine methylation abrogates retention activity and leads to ecDNA loss, suggesting that methylation-sensitive interactions modulate episomal DNA retention. These results highlight the DNA elements and regulatory logic of mitotic ecDNA retention. Amplifications of retention elements promote the maintenance of oncogenic ecDNA across generations of cancer cells, revealing the principles of episome immortality intrinsic to the human genome.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CGCSDF-2021100007;F99CA274692;K00CA274692;K99CA286968;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-2146755;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2474-22;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Investigator (H.Y.C.);Hanna Gray Fellowship (J.A.B.);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 33 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time- dependent covariate) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including adjusting for influenza activity as an effect modifier.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43920 (82.2%) were vaccinated by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1130 (2.12%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over time the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of influenza was not significantly different during periods when influenza activity was low (HR, .70; 95% C.I., .42 - 1.15; P = .15) or medium (HR, 1.20; 95% C.I., .86 - 1.67; P = .28), but was significantly higher for the vaccinated state than the unvaccinated state when influenza activity was high (HR, 1.33; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.64; P = .009).

ConclusionsThis study was unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found that influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of influenza when influenza activity was high.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found a significantly higher risk of influenza with vaccination when influenza activity was high.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760479831324

From the same sample, we co-isolated a PLV, Tsa-S2b, that replicates concomitantly with TetV-2. Remarkably, TetV-2 infection also reactivates at least two additional PLVs integrated into the host genome. We show that these PLVs exert a virophage-like effect, reducing the fitness of the giant virus. Comparative genomics reveals that these virophagic PLVs are related to the autonomous lytic PLV TsV-N1, sharing structural but not replication-associated genes. This newly described pathosystem provides a unique model to investigate the evolution of PLVs and the parasitic mechanisms underlying virophage-giant virus interactions.","[{""name"":""European FEDER Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""project 1166-39417;""},{""name"":""Excellence Initiative of Aix-Marseille University â A*MIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, accurate strain-level analysis remains challenging due to limited linkage information, ambiguous read mapping, and complicating factors such as genome similarity, sequencing depth, and community complexity. These challenges are especially pronounced for short-read metagenomic data when estimating the relative abundances of multiple strains - a task critical for genotype-phenotype association studies. Results: To address this gap, we present Strainify, which enables accurate strain-level abundance estimation from short-read metagenomes with as little as 1% genome coverage. Specifically, Strainify combines (1) identification of informative variants via core genome alignment, (2) filtering of confounding variants via a window-based test, and (3) maximum likelihood estimation of strain abundances. A Shannon entropy-weighted version of the model further improves robustness in noisy, low-coverage settings by downweighting sites with low information content. Across simulated communities of varying complexity, Strainify consistently outperformed existing approaches. On mock community sequencing data, Strainify's estimates aligned more closely with reference abundances. When applied to a longitudinal gut microbiome dataset, Strainify successfully recapitulated the reported temporal dynamics of Bacteroides ovatus strain groups, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically meaningful patterns from real-world metagenomes. Together, these results establish Strainify as a robust and versatile solution for accurate strain-level abundance estimation in short-read, low-coverage microbiome studies.

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), a leading cause of bloodstream and urinary tract infections (UTIs), are often resistant to one or more antibiotic classes. Previously, we identified a clonal group of ExPEC strains (P1A) that persisted over a 5-year period from 2012 to 2016 within a female patient who suffered from frequent recurrent UTIs. A subset of these isolates carried a plasmid-borne MDR island (Ec17R) harboring 17 resistance genes. Sampling of fecal and urine samples in 2019 indicated that the patient remained colonized with the P1A lineage, including Ec17R-positive strains, over 7 years after collection of the first P1A isolates in 2012. Highlighting the public health relevance and mobility of Ec17R, we found that Ec17R-like islands are globally distributed across diverse bacterial species from various environmental, agricultural, and clinical sources, including multiple ExPEC isolates from local pediatric patients. By applying clustering approaches and Bayesian network modeling to 267 pediatric ExPEC isolates, we found that functionally distinct classes of resistance genes (including several heavy metal resistance genes) have a high probability of co-occurrence, possibly reflecting carriage within MDR islands like Ec17R. Finally, we observed that strains within the P1A lineage are recalcitrant to antibiotics for which they have no known resistance mechanisms, suggesting that these pathogens have means beyond their formidable array of resistance genes to survive within a host for years despite the administration of numerous, robust antimicrobial treatments.

SIGNIFICANCEMultidrug resistance (MDR) in bacteria is a growing global health crisis that compromises our ability to treat routine infections. In this study, we investigated a clonal lineage of pathogenic Escherichia coli that persisted for many years in a patient with recurrent urinary tract infections. A subset of the E. coli strains carried by this patient possessed a large genomic island encoding resistance to multiple antibiotic classes. This MDR island is globally distributed across diverse bacterial species and niches, from clinical samples to agricultural and environmental reservoirs. Using probabilistic modeling of nearly 300 clinical isolates, we identified networks of resistance gene co-occurrence that link antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, suggesting the potential for environmental pollutants to contribute to MDR dissemination. Notably, patient-derived isolates also survived certain clinically relevant antibiotic treatments despite lacking known resistance mechanisms, highlighting tolerance and persistence as important, often overlooked drivers of therapeutic failure.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM134331;GM007464;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Defense"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0447fe631"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""W81XWH-22-1-0800 (SC210103);""},{""name"":""Margolis Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""University of Utah Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""University of Utah 3i graduate research fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, the relationship between their catalytic activities and antimicrobial functions remains largely unknown. Particularly, few biologically relevant substrates of these proteases have been identified. Huanglongbing (HLB) has been a major threat to the citrus industry worldwide. The HLB-associated bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), was previously shown to deploy an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) to promote disease in citrus. In this study, we identified an outer membrane protein (OMP) of Las, LasOMP1, as a substrate of the citrus PLCP CsRD21a. LasOMP1 is one of the most highly expressed genes in Las. CsRD21a cleaves LasOMP1 and produces cleaved peptide products, which could be detected in vitro and in HLB-diseased citrus plants. We found that CsRD21a targets the N-terminal portion of LasOMP1, potentially at an extracellular loop region. Importantly, transgenic sweet orange overexpressing CsRD21a showed reduced Las titers and delayed disease symptoms, highlighting that engineering this protease is a promising strategy to enhance HLB resistance in citrus. Together, our work reveals a pathogen-derived substrate of plant PLCPs and highlights bacterial OMPs as direct targets of plant defense.

Significance StatementHuanglongbing (HLB) is the most devastating disease of citrus with no resistance having been identified in commercial cultivars. Previous work implicated papain-like cysteine proteases (PLCPs) as an important hub of defense in citrus; however, their precise role in HLB tolerance remained unclear. Here, we identify and characterize an outer membrane protein (OMP) from the HLB-associated bacterium as a substrate of the citrus PLCP RD21a. We demonstrate a specific cleavage of the bacterial OMP by citrus RD21a, which may impair pathogen growth and/or activate plant immunity. Importantly, overexpression of RD21a enhances HLB tolerance in sweet oranges. This work identifies OMPs as substrates of plant PLCPs and provides insights into protease defense functions.","[{""name"":""USDA-NIFA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020-70029-33197;2022-70029-38471;2023-70029-41280;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UKRI BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W00691X/1;BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""ERC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101019324;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32525008;U23A20198;""},{""name"":""Hatch"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FLA-CRC-005979;""},{""name"":""Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Extension"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Florida Citrus Initiative Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Citrus Research and Development Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

To overcome these challenges, we developed Telomere Conformation Capture by sequencing (Telomere-C), a novel high-throughput approach for the genome-wide identification of telomeric chromatin interactions. We applied Telomere-C to three normal fibroblast cell lines (BJ, IMR90, WI38), one telomerase-positive cancer cell line (HeLa S3) and two cancer cell lines (U2-OS and WI38-VA13) that maintain telomeres by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). We generated millions of telomere-associated reads per sample and identified up to 41,026 interaction peaks. We successfully validated previously-described telomeric interaction sites (e.g., TERT and DUX4), and critically, revealed a novel class of ultra-long-range interactions extending over 5 Mb away from the telomere, which surprisingly constitute over 80% of all identified contacts. Contrary to prior studies focusing on protein coding gene interactions, we discovered that the telomeric 3D interactome is overwhelmingly anchored at repetitive element hubs, particularly interstitial telomeric sequence (ITS), telomere-associated repeat 1 (TAR1) and D20S16 elements. We found that the clustering of these interactions correlates strongly with cell-type-specific telomere maintenance. Most notably, D20S16 telomeric interactions were uniquely and highly enriched in ALT cancer cells, suggesting a mechanistic link. Taken together, our study effectively constructs the first high resolution maps of the telomeric 3D interactome, redefining its scope to be dominated by ultra-long-range contacts with repetitive elements. This work provides fundamental insights into telomeric nuclear organization and establishes the telomeric D20S16 interaction as a molecular signature for the ALT pathway.","[{""name"":""The National Cancer Institutes of the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00CA226387;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

This can nominate potential mechanistic pathways from SNPs to genes to traits, while providing cell type or tissue context. Surprisingly, systematic colocalization testing with bulk-tissue eQTLs fails to link the majority of GWAS loci with gene expression changes. Mapping eQTLs with single-cell expression data has the potential to reveal the missing regulatory effects of GWAS variants. However, current pseudobulk cluster-based approaches may be underpowered when clustering accuracy is imperfect or with an incorrectly selected cluster resolution. To improve power of single-cell colocalization tests, we developed a cluster-free method, scJLIM. By modeling eQTL interactions with continuous cell states (e.g., principal components), scJLIM estimates eQTL significance and colocalization in individual cells. We benchmarked our method with simulated data, demonstrating improvements in power over pseudobulk methods. In our main applications, we used scJLIM to analyze blood and brain scRNA-seq datasets paired with autoimmune and neurological disease GWAS, respectively. We identified nearly twice as many total colocalizations compared with traditional pseudobulk analyses carried out within the major cell populations of these tissues. Aligning with a recent experimental study, we highlighted an example of the ETS2 gene colocalizing with an inflammatory bowel disease GWAS locus in a subset of myeloid cells. For Parkinson's disease (PD), our results pointed to TRPV2 as a potential gene of interest, corroborated by transcriptional changes in both post-mortem PD brains and iPSC-derived neuronal models of alpha-synucleinopathy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Here we ask how brain health relates to peripheral biomarkers of bodily health including body mass index, blood pressure, and blood biochemistry results. We use partial least squares analysis to identify generalizable patterns of covariance between multi-modal neuroimaging data (structural, functional, diffusion, and arterial spin labeling MRI), demographic, and peripheral physiological markers in two large-scale deeply phenotyped datasets: the Human Connectome Project-Aging and UK Biobank. This data-driven pattern learning approach identifies two principal axes of brain-body associations in both biological sex groups. The first axis is driven by the dominant contribution of age. Across multiple brain measures, aging is associated with loss of brain structural integrity and cerebral vascular dysfunction. The second axis is driven by metabolic features, characterized by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated body mass index, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin, glucose, and alanine aminotransferase, and reduced cerebral blood perfusion. Finally, we show that deviations from a healthy metabolic profile are linked to cognitive deficits, particularly in females. Our study contributes to development of comprehensive translatable biomarkers for brain health assessment, and highlights the importance of metabolic health as a determinant of brain health.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, the use of meta-omics to link enzyme function directly with complex, community-level phenotypes remain largely unexplored. To overcome this gap, we developed a novel framework that integrates ecological concepts by microbial community perturbation with association analysis to a targeted phenotype. Specifically, we introduce a hypothesis-free ""bait and switch"" strategy demonstrated through salt marsh soil microcosm pulse experiments to detect and characterize novel enzymes responsible for chitin degradation. Soil microbial communities were ""baited"" with shell compost, a chitin-rich substrate, to trigger community succession toward chitin degraders and gene upregulation of chitinases. A ""switch"" was then employed, by addition of glucose, inducing rapid downregulation of genes putatively responsible for chitin degradation. Results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach to identify functionally important enzymes, in this example, 48 hours after chitin addition. The bait and switch community perturbation provides a framework for discovery of polymer degrading enzymes present in complex microbial communities and serves as a proof of concept applicable for linking enzyme function with emergent community level phenotypes.","[{""name"":""New England Biolabs (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04ywg3445"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OCE1839171;CCF1918749;CBET1751854;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01ES030317A;""},{""name"":""National Aeronautics and Space Administration"",""id"":""https://ror.org/027ka1x80"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""80NSSC20K0814;80NSSC22K1044;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

To address this question, we used a murine recombination-independent muscle fibre-specific doxycycline-inducible fluorescent myonuclear labelling approach, EdU stem cell fate tracking, two durations of muscle mechanical overload (MOV, 3 days and 7 days), and fluorescent histology.

Ghana virus (GhV), identified in 2012, is the only African bat henipavirus with a near-complete genome assembly. However, without isolates in culture, GhV biology, pathogenicity, and zoonotic potential remain poorly understood. Using reverse genetics, we recovered a full-length infectious clone of GhV at BSL-4 following rational reconstruction of its incomplete 3' leader and modification of a non-canonical transcriptional initiation site. GhV demonstrated restricted receptor tropism (ephrin-B2 but not ephrin-B3) and distinct innate immune antagonism. Replication was attenuated in primary human cells, but was enhanced in bat cells. In Syrian golden hamsters, GhV infection caused no disease or mortality. Furthermore, a chimeric NiV encoding the GhV receptor-binding protein was completely attenuated in vivo, implicating ephrin-B3 receptor usage as a critical determinant of HNV pathogenesis. These findings elucidate GhV zoonotic potential and inform strategies for virus surveillance and control.

These mechanisms were long thought to rely exclusively on ATPase or GTPase proteins, until the discovery of CTPase activity in the bacterial chromosome segregation protein ParB. In the ParABS system, CTP binding enables ParB accumulation around the centromere-like parS DNA sites to activate the ATPase ParA, thereby facilitating chromosome partitioning to daughter cells. CTP hydrolysis then releases ParB from DNA for recycling. This discovery uncovered a new regulatory principle, but the broader diversity of proteins employing a CTPase mechanism remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale survey of proteins harboring the ParB-CTPase fold across bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes. While many ParB-like proteins follow the canonical ParABS organization with ParA partners, we also identify numerous orphan homologs encoded outside of the parAB operon, frequently linked to mobile genetic elements that may have driven their rapid diversification. The ParB-CTPase folds in these divergent proteins are often fused to lineage-specific domains with diverse predicted biological activities. We further demonstrate that while many homologs retain CTP-binding, others instead bind ATP or GTP, revealing a broader spectrum of nucleotide specificities than previously appreciated. Our findings establish the ParB-CTPase fold as a widely distributed and evolutionarily versatile NTP-binding module, repeatedly co-opted through domain fusion and shifts in nucleotide specificity to enable functions far beyond the classical ParABS-mediated DNA segregation.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""221776/Z/2/Z;227755/Z/23/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

In Drosophila, previous work has shown that fruitless and doublesex transcription factors identify neurons driving sexually dimorphic behaviour. However, the organisation of dimorphic neurons into functional circuits remains unclear.

We now present the connectome of the entire Drosophila male central nervous system. This contains 166,691 neurons spanning the brain and ventral nerve cord, fully proofread and comprehensively annotated including fruitless and doublesex expression and 11,691 cell types. By comparison with a previous female brain connectome, we provide the first comprehensive description of the differences between male and female brains to synaptic resolution. Of 7,319 cross-matched cell types in the central brain, 114 are dimorphic with an additional 262 male- and 69 female-specific (totalling 4.8% of neurons in males and 2.4% in females).

This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or the presence of male-specific arbours on neurons that are otherwise similar between sexes. Numerous circuit switches reroute sensory information to form conserved, antagonistic circuits controlling opposing behaviours.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220343/Z/20/Z;221300/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00tw3jy02"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Due to this, there are now several variants of Martian regolith that are chemically known and commercially available. These simulants are vital for panspermia models that suggest a transfer of simple life throughout the solar system via ejecta containing life from Mars when its surface was more favourable to host life. Bacteria that produce endospores are suitable candidates for these models as they have adequate protection from the harsh conditions of space, particularly against solar radiation. To assess this, the simple endospore former, Bacillus subtilis, was assessed for growth on several Martian regolith that represented different locations and epochs of Mars. This consisted of a conventional Martian regolith, a sulphur rich regolith, and a simulant of the Jezero crater which was thought to have once been flooded with water. We found that the sulphur rich regolith inhibited endospore formation, while the other two variants favoured endospore production. Interestingly, we also identified that pulsing of UVC in a simulation of endospores on rotational ejecta show that endospores break down faster with lower rotational frequency despite receiving the same UVC dose. Moreover, and most strikingly is that viable endospores after surviving UVC dosage displayed elevated expression of the DNA damage SOS response gene, RecA. Importantly, this study suggests that astrobiological approaches that utilise endospore viability as a benchmark for survival require reassessment as genomic integrity may be compromised.

ImportanceCurrent panspermia models that explore the potential interplanetary transfer of simple microbes, particularly those that focus on Mars, apply a combination of Martian topology and bacterial survival. This study assesses Bacillus subtilis endospore formation on different Martain regolith mediums and simulates their potential exposure on fast and slow rotations while being exposed to UV radiation to simulate space radiation. We outline what regions of Mars would be suitable for the formation of endospores, and moreover, we assess viable endospores post-exposure for the expression of the SOS DNA damage repair gene, RecA. Endospores that are viable after withstanding near lethal doses of UVC show elevated expression of RecA. While our study adds vital information to understanding Martian topography and microbial survival, our finding RecA expression analysis post-exposure adds important information to our understanding of endospores as a whole and should be factored into future astrobiological approaches.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

We overturn the fundamental assumption that APC-mutant tumors exist at maximal WNT activation, revealing instead that cancer cells occupy a precarious ""WNT-just-right"" zone along a signaling continuum. This discovery exposes an unprecedented therapeutic vulnerability: while normal intestinal epithelium thrives with enhanced WNT signaling, APC-mutant tumor cells undergo apoptosis when pushed beyond their oncogenic setpoint, a phenomenon we term ""over-WNTing."" Through systematic organoid-based screening, we identified that WNT hyperactivation through multiple approaches: GSK3 inhibition, concentrated WNT proteins, or APC knockdown in GSK3-null backgrounds, selectively kills tumor cells by hyperactivating the driving pathway of CRC. Mechanistically, over-WNTing in APC-mutant cells triggers spillover into non-canonical planar cell polarity signaling, where RHOC upregulation induces ROCK1/2-mediated apoptosis. We demonstrate therapeutic efficacy across the neoplastic continuum, from adenomas to metastatic CRC, including patient-derived tumors, validating GSK3 inhibition with a novel nanoparticle formulation. This discovery enables the first cancer therapy that simultaneously enhances normal tissue function while eliminating tumors.

In nature, plants do not receive exogenous sugar supply, form symbiosis with microbes, and plant growth is influenced by soil edaphic factors. Thus, physiological and multi-omic analyses from plants grown on synthetic media will differ from those of soil-grown plants due to the influence of sucrose, and the lack of influence from microbiota and soil edaphic factors on plant growth. The rapid advancements in spatial-omics call for accurate characterization of plants grown in conditions similar to soil. To address the issue, we developed Artificial Soil (ArtSoil), a growth medium containing essential nutrients for plant growth, and aqueous soil extract (ASE) to maintain soil microbiomes and edaphic factors, simultaneously eliminating the need for sugar supplementation in the medium. We compared Arabidopsis thaliana grown on conventional media to ArtSoil under various growth conditions, and showed that complex soil microbiota in ArtSoil promote plant growth without physiological side effects induced by sucrose. We demonstrate an application for ArtSoil in single-cell transcriptomics and report microbiota-induced cell-type specificity in immune and nitrogen signaling. We tested ArtSoil with six types of ASEs to present the potential of ArtSoil in decoupling the effects of nutrients from microbiota in plant growth. We conclude that ArtSoil recapitulates the soil environment compared to conventional media, hence, enabling physiologically relevant plant growth.

Significance statementLaboratory plant growth commonly relies on sugar-supplemented media and sterile growth conditions, which introduces physiological artifacts and fails to capture the natural influences of soil microbiota and edaphic factors, leading to analyses that diverge from native conditions.

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer.

We isolated a DRM-E containing a G23 deletion (G23del) in Mpro with high resistance (>1,000 fold) to ensitrelvir, but not to the other Mpro inhibitor (nirmatrelvir) or to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor remdesivir. The contribution of G23del was confirmed by generating a recombinant luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del in the non-structural protein 5 (NSP5) gene ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc G23del). {Delta}3a7b-Nluc G23del exhibited significant resistance to ensitrelvir in both cultured cells an in K18 hACE2 transgenic mice. Binding affinity revealed that G23del mutation substantially altered Mpro binding affinity for ensitrelvir but not nirmatrelvir. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that G23del in Mpro can confer high resistance to ensitrelvir. Positively, G23del in Mpro does not render SARS-CoV-2 resistant to nirmatrelvir or remdesivir, suggesting the feasibility of treating infections with SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del with these other approved antivirals.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical use of SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs is increasingly challenged by the emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify and characterize antiviral escape SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly for FDA-approved antivirals. Our study addresses this by employing a luminescent attenuated virus platform ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc WT) to safely identify and characterize resistance mutations without the concern of using virulent forms of SARS-CoV-2. Using this safe approach, we have identified a G23 deletion (G23del) in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which mediates resistance to ensitrelvir in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, while G23del was able to confer more than 1,000-fold increased resistance to ensitrelvir, SARS-CoV-2 containing G23del remained sensitive to other Mpro (nirmatrelvir) and RdRp (remdesivir) inhibitors. Altogether, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using {Delta}3a7b-Nluc to safely identify and characterize drug resistant viruses without the biosafety concern of using virulent SARS-CoV-2 and advance the design of next-generation antiviral drugs.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19 AI171403;R01 AI161363;R01 AI161363-03S1;5N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

These phage tail-like macromolecular machines puncture their target by a tube that is propelled by a contractile sheath. The mechanism underlying CIS firing, which starts with target binding and ends with sheath contraction, remains unclear.

Here, we investigate the extracellular CIS from Algoriphagus machipongonensis (AlgoCIS) by a multimodal cryo-electron microscopy approach and structure-guided engineering, which allowed us to arrest AlgoCIS in multiple intermediate states of firing. Together with the post-firing structure, our data suggest a stepwise firing mechanism involving all modules: signal propagation starts with the binding of the tail-fibers, followed by opening of the cage, an expansion of the baseplate iris, and resulting in sheath contraction and the release of cap adaptor.

Our study will serve as a framework for understanding the firing mechanism of diverse CISs and will facilitate the engineering of CISs for biomedical applications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Direct mechanistic evidence from human-relevant models remains limited. To address this gap, we exposed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids (COs; six independent lines) to physiologically relevant APAP concentrations (25, 50, and 100 M) for 5 days starting at day 21, a developmental stage corresponding to the late first trimester. We assessed organoid growth, apoptosis, neuronal/progenitor ratios, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), and functional maturation using multielectrode arrays (2-4 months). APAP exposure did not alter growth dynamics, cytoarchitecture, or viability, with apoptosis rates remaining below 1% in all conditions. Neuronal and progenitor cell proportions were unchanged. Bulk RNA-seq revealed subtle, dose-dependent transcriptional changes only at higher doses (0 differentially expressed genes at 25 M, 9 at 50 M, and 16 at 100 M), enriched for neurodevelopmental pathways. Despite these slight molecular perturbations, electrophysiological recordings showed normal firing rates, burst frequency, and network synchronicity across exposure groups. Taken together, therapeutic APAP concentrations produced only modest transcriptional effects without structural or functional consequences in developing cortical organoids. These results align with recent sibling-controlled epidemiological studies that attribute reported associations to confounding and provide mechanistic reassurance that recommended APAP use during pregnancy is unlikely to disrupt fetal brain development.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21HD109616;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R56MH128365;R21MH128827;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00j4k1h63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01ES033636;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) provide richer information than simple population genetic summary statistics and can potentially improve the power and accuracy of such inference. We present mrpast, a tool for inferring complex demographic history from ARGs. mrpast uses a composite likelihood formulation based on the pairwise sample coalescence time, observable in an ARG, and the coalescence probabilities from a continuous-time Markov process. We have evaluated mrpasts accuracy on a variety of models, including stepping-stone models with asymmetric migrations, changes in effective population sizes, out-of-Africa, and American admixture. We demonstrated mrpasts accuracy using simulated ARGs and inferred ARGs, and its high versatility in jointly inferring all parameters in complex models, including time of demographic events (e.g., population split, admixture), effective population size (e.g., constant, exponential growth), and gene flow (e.g., admixture proportion, migration rate). Extending the three-population out-of-Africa model with asymmetric migrations, we observed significantly more migrations from East Asians to Europeans than from Europeans to East Asians. Notably, mrpast can reliably recover all parameters in an American admixture model, when treating non-admixed Native Americans as an unsampled (""ghost"") population. Applying this model to Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Colombian populations, we found that the reconstructed histories of Native and admixed Americans align closely with both historical records and genetic evidence. Lastly, mrpast provides a comprehensive pipeline to facilitate easier, more appropriate, and robust demographic inference, in which users can easily simulate, infer, and manipulate ARGs, and illustrate and test a demographic model.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM150579;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Plasmid dependent phages (PDPs) are particularly attractive as therapeutics because they can both kill targeted pathogen cells, whilst also potentially preventing the further spread of antibiotic resistance genes encoded by plasmids. However, we lack experimental studies of the ecological and evolutionary response of multidrug resistance plasmids against plasmid dependent phage treatment under ecologically relevant scenarios allowing plasmid conjugation. We experimentally evolved populations of E. coli carrying the multidrug resistance RP4 plasmid with the PRD1 PDP under conditions where conjugation was associated with either strong or weak benefits. When opportunities for conjugation were rare, PRD1 only transiently suppressed the conjugative plasmid population due to the rapid evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids that lacked conjugative ability. Increasing the ecological opportunity for conjugation enhanced plasmid suppression and delayed the evolution of PRD1 resistant plasmids. PRD1 resistance was associated with reduced conjugative ability, but this trade-off was complex due to the heterogeneous impacts of resistance mutations on pilus production and conjugative ability. Mutations and IS element insertions in conjugation genes caused a wide range of PRD1 resistance phenotypes, ranging from complete resistance (virB4) to partial resistance (trbB, trbL). Bioinformatic analysis of publicly available IncP plasmid sequences showed that truncated variants of VirB4 protein are common in natural populations, suggesting that plasmid-dependent phages are an important selective pressure in microbial communities. Our results demonstrate an evolutionary trade-off between conjugative ability and phage resistance that cannot be easily circumvented by plasmids. Targeting multidrug resistance plasmids with PDPs is likely to drive loss of conjugation limiting the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial communities.","[{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W031361/1;""},{""name"":""UKRI Frontiers Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/Y031067/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Here, by coupling visualisation of global sub-Hz firing bursts to ER ultrastructural manipulations in hiPSC-derived cortical neurons, alongside physical simulations, we establish a key ER structure-function principle: neuronal ER architecture dictates Ca2+ replenishment speed. Altering ER structure hinders network ER luminal connectivity and Ca2+ propagation from refill points at plasma membrane contact sites, impairing the ERs capability to supply repetitive Ca2+ bursts. The ER morpho-regulatory control of Ca2+ refill speed thus constitutes a switch on neuronal activity.

To examine the evolutionary divergence of TBP homologs in different species, we determined the ability of murine TBP and its paralogs to complement endogenous TBP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite their highly conserved DNA-binding domains, murine TBP homologs were unable to fully rescue the lethality caused by TBP inactivation in yeast. This incomplete complementation correlates with a failure to fully support binding by RNA Pols II and III. Furthermore, we show that the divergent N-terminal domain (NTD) of TBP contributes to species-specific activity and modulates RNA Pol II binding changes in stress-induced response.

Leopards (Panthera pardus), a widely distributed generalist species, provide an ideal case for studying the role of the environment. The population dynamics of African and Asian leopards differ dramatically, with near panmixia in Africa versus a strong structure and eight subspecies in Asia. Fossil records show that a population in Europe disappeared after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), further pointing to complex range dynamics in Eurasia. In this study, we explicitly test the role of climate in shaping leopards population dynamics across the continents, by quantitatively combining paleoclimatic, demographic, and genetic simulations over the last 450 thousand years. Using an Approximate Bayesian Computational framework, we show that the genetic structure differences between Africa and Asia can be explained by distinct historical climatic conditions in these two continents: most of sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia exhibited a stable range without geographical barriers, while other areas such as Morocco, Afghanistan and Northeast Asia showed expansion and extinction cycles during glacial and interglacials. We further model population dynamics in Europe and validate it against fossil and radiocarbon dates records. We find that European populations were likely fragile, with extinctions repeatedly predicted over multiple glacial cycles, indicating that climate change possibly led to the extinction of the European subspecies following the LGM. Notably, we found that climate during the Holocene should have allowed a more recent recolonisation that did not happen, indicating other factors such as human presence might have blocked it.","[{""name"":""Cambridge Commonwealth European and International Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05sprqy15"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Actions"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101028348;101063265;""},{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/S007164/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""647787;""},{""name"":""Leverhulme Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012mzw131"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RPG-2020-317;""},{""name"":""Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CoV polymerase template switching remains unclear. Using magnetic tweezers, we show that the CoV non-structural protein (nsp) 13-helicase drives polymerase template switching, followed by copy-back RNA synthesis. This activity requires nsp13-helicase ATPase activity and a duplex RNA downstream of the CoV polymerase. This novel function of nsp13-helicase is targeted by the nucleotide analogs remdesivir and molnupiravir, whose incorporation in the nascent strand increases CoV polymerase template switching probability, leading to defective RNA production. We propose a novel mechanism of action where incorporation of these analogs dramatically reduces full length genome copy number by stimulating polymerase template switching. Our study further demonstrates nsp13-helicases central role in CoV replication and how this enzyme function can be indirectly targeted by analogs.","[{""name"":""NWO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OCENW.XL21.XL21.115;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI161841-01;AI171292;AI158463;""},{""name"":""NIGMS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GM12260;GM067153;""},{""name"":""Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Gravitation grant 024.003.019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Upon cell entry, translation of the virus genome is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 untranslated region (UTR). Despite early identification of the poliovirus IRES, structure determination has been hampered by the flexibility and complexity of the RNA ([~]450 nt, five structured domains), the requirement for almost all of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs), and additional dependency on PCBP2 for trans-activation. As a result, there is little mechanistic information on how enterovirus Type 1 IRESs recruit and direct translational machinery.

To address this, here we reconstitute human translation initiation on a model poliovirus IRES and examine 48S complexes by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Our structures reveal a novel set of interactions between the IRES and the translation machinery. Domain IVc contacts uS19 and uS13 on the small ribosomal subunit, and the conserved apical GNRA tetraloop interacts directly with the initiator tRNA during start-codon recognition. We demonstrate that disruption of these contacts causes defects in IRES-driven translation and virus replication. Together, our results define the structural and molecular basis for translation initiation on the Type 1 IRES, and highlight the potential for RNA-RNA tertiary interactions as new targets for antiviral therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/Z515668/1;BB/M011151/1;BBS/E/PI/230002A;BBS/E/PI/23NB0003;""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/T000376/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220620/Z/20/Z;202471/Z/16/A;221818/Z/20/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, the factors limiting their spontaneous recruitment remain unclear. Using multi-omics techniques, we identified impaired myelopoiesis and monocyte development in both mice and AD patients. While not the primary cause of the disease, this impairment is associated with disease progression. In the 5xFAD mouse model, monocyte differentiation was found to be disrupted due to a maladaptive bone marrow (BM) response, driven by type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. A similar phenotype was found in circulating monocytes from AD patients compared to healthy controls. Blocking IFN-I with monoclonal antibodies or using chimeric AD mice with BM from mice lacking the IFN-I receptor (IFNAR1) alleviated myelopoiesis dysfunction, normalized monocyte phenotypes, and reduced cognitive impairment. These improvements in myeloid function were accompanied by an increased homing of monocyte-derived macrophages in the AD brain. Our results reveal an unexpected dysfunction in BM myelopoiesis in the context of neurodegeneration and support the emerging concept that neurodegenerative diseases are not solely brain-centric.","[{""name"":""Advanced European Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7417;""},{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""991/16;""},{""name"":""ISF Legacy Heritage Bio-Medical Science Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1354/15;""},{""name"":""Thompson Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""FundaciÃ³n RamÃ³n Areces"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, existing methods for heritability estimation attributed to rare-coding variants are often limited by the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and by the sparse nature of rare variant data. We introduce FLEX (Fast, LD-aware Estimation of eXome-wide and gene-level heritability), a scalable and flexible framework for estimating and partitioning heritability across genes or sets of genes using WES data. FLEX integrates all coding variants- from common to ultra-rare - within a unifled model and corrects for LD-induced effects to improve the accuracy of heritability estimates. In addition, FLEX supports both individual-level and summary statistic data and is computationally efflcient for biobank-scale datasets. Through extensive simulations, we show that FLEX is well-calibrated while providing accurate heritability estimates.

We applied FLEX to WES data across N = 153, 351 unrelated European ancestry individuals and 20 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank. We identifled 64 gene-trait pairs with signiflcant gene-level heritability (p < 0.05/18, 624 accounting for the number of protein-coding genes tested), among which rare coding variants explained 38% of gene-level heritability, on average. Compared to heritability estimates from genome-wide imputed SNPs, incorporation of rare and ultra-rare coding variants led to a 24.8% increase in heritability on average, while effect sizes at rare and ultra-rare variants are substantially larger ({approx} 18x on average). Partitioning across variant effect annotations, we flnd that predicted loss-of-function variants had stronger individual effects than missense variants (24% on average) while missense variants accounted for a greater share of rare coding heritability. Together, FLEX provides an adaptable and accurate approach for quantifying gene-level heritability, advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, and facilitating the discovery of trait-relevant genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM153406;""},{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HL170604;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DK132775;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CAREER-1943497;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Here, we revive the idea of a standard model for ion channels based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation, and apply it to a recently curated database of ion channel models. We demonstrate that this standard formulation, which we refer to as an omnimodel, accurately fits the majority of voltage-gated models in the database (over 3,000 models). It produces similar, if not identical, responses to voltage-clamp protocols in simulations where the ion channel omnimodels were used. Importantly, the standard formalism enables easy comparison of models based on parameter settings. It can also be used to make new observations about the space of ion channel kinetics found in neurons. Furthermore, it facilitates the inference of ion channel parameters from the responses to standard protocols. We provide an interactive platform to compare and select channel models, and encourage the community to use this standard formulation whenever possible, to facilitate understanding and comparison among models.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation, Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UKRI-BBSRC BB/N019512/1;""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2064 â Project number 390727645;""},{""name"":""CRC ``Robust Vision''."",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1233;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SynapSeek;DeepCoMechTome;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given the BLA and mPFCs differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH130755;F31MH133373;""},{""name"":""Alfred P.

High-Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, often originates from Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinomas (STICs) in the fallopian tubes, yet their minute size and our historical reliance on standard 2D histology contribute to their underreporting. Here, we present a spatially resolved, multi-omics framework that integrates whole-organ 3D imaging at cellular resolution with targeted proteomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic profiling to detect and characterize microscopic tubal lesions. Using this platform, we identified a total of 99 STICs and their presumed precursors that harbor TP53 mutations in morphologically unremarkable tubal epithelium in all five specimens obtained from cancer-free organ donors with average-risk of developing ovarian cancer. Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control. In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche MÃ©dicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""FÃ©dÃ©ration pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 âEspoir en tÃªteâ 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

Despite recent progress in de novo design of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides; this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

However, while considerable advances have been made in the de novo design of protein structure and function, the same has not yet been achieved for RNA tertiary structures of similar intricacy. Here, we describe a generative diffusion framework, RFDpoly, for generalized de novo biopolymer (RNA, DNA and protein) design, and use it to create diverse and designable RNA structures. We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

While we have some understanding of how sensory information is processed in the sensory periphery, the classification of cues according to valence in central brain circuits is less well understood. Here, we addressed this question in the Drosophila larva, where we could leverage the synaptic resolution connectome to determine where innate and learnt information from distinct aversive and appetitive sensory modalities converges; and combine this with imaging and manipulation of neural activity to determine how valence information is encoded and used to guide navigation. We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors. Together, our study reveals a neuron that bi-directionally encodes valence and controls actions.","[{""name"":""MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology Core funding"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Janelia Research Campus"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013sk6x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""205038/Z/16/Z;205050/Z/16/Z;""},{""name"":""ERC grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-2018-COG: 819650;""},{""name"":""DFG German Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2117-587 422037984;""},{""name"":""Fyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""ATIP-Avenir Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760479831324
