Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Notably, both variants carry mutations, S31del of KP.3.1.1 and T22N of XEC, that could introduce new N-linked glycans on the Spike N-terminal domain (NTD), emphasizing the urgent need to assess their potential changes in viral characteristics. Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Previous research has predominantly focused on the cognitive aspects of mind-wandering, overlooking the potential embodied or interoceptive components that contribute to our ongoing thought patterns. In this study, we addressed this gap by exploring ""body-wandering""-thoughts related to internal bodily sensations such as breathing, heartbeat, and gastrointestinal functions. To assess body-wandering, we applied a retrospective multi-dimensional interoceptive experience sampling approach in 536 healthy participants concurrently with resting-state functional brain imaging. Our findings revealed that body-wandering is distinct from cognitively focused thoughts, underscoring the unique role of embodied processes in ongoing experience. Embodied thought patterns were associated with increased negative affect, heightened physiological arousal, and reduced ADHD symptoms. In contrast, cognitive-focused thoughts were linked to decreased negative affect, lower arousal, and higher depression symptoms. Notably, body-wandering corresponded with a unique neural signature involving increased connectivity between somatomotor, interoceptive, and thalamocortical brain networks. These results emphasise the importance of incorporating embodied processes into theoretical models of mind-wandering and suggest that individual differences in body-wandering significantly impact emotional states and mental health.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

How cell type diversification is constrained by the stable separation between families over vast evolutionary times remains unknown. Here, integrating single-nucleus multiomic sequencing and deep learning, we show that hundreds of sequence features (motifs) divide into distinct sets associated with accessible genomes of specific cell type families. This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations. We propose that long-term stability of cell type families is maintained through genome access specified by conserved motif sets, or  vocabularies, whereas cell types diversify through flexible use of motifs within each set.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Natural Killer (NK) cells play a role in mediating air pollutant effects and regulating vaccine immunity. Objective: This real-world study, conducted on participants in the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine trial, studied the effects of wildfire smoke exposure on long-term vaccine effects. Methods: We collected blood samples from 52 healthy, non-smoking participants (ages 26-83) before and 1 month after placebo or vaccine injections during heavy wildfire smoke events in Sacramento. The study included 28 vaccinated (Group 1) and 24 placebo-injected (Group 2) individuals, the latter vaccinated several months later, outside wildfire season. Blood samples from both Group 1 and 2 were also investigated 6 months after the second dose of vaccine. We analyzed intracellular cytokines, B and NK cell markers by flow cytometry, and serum immunoglobulin levels against common coronaviruses using multiplex assays. Results: A robust S-RBD-specific IgG response observed 1 month post booster, declined variably 6 months later. Wildfire smoke acutely increased IL-13 expression by CD56bright NK cells. IL-13+CD56bright NK cells at the time of vaccination negatively correlated with anti-S-RBD IgG (r=-0.41, p<0.05) one month later. Total IgG levels on the other hand, positively correlated with the air quality index (AQI) measured during vaccination (r=0.96, p<0.01). Similarly to age (but not sex, BMI or race/ethnicity), the two-week AQI averages during vaccination showed a significant negative correlation with anti-S-RBD IgG levels 6 months later (r=-0.41, p<0.05). Conclusion: Wildfire smoke may lead to inappropriate immunoglobulin production and diminished vaccine immunity. Our novel findings highlight a previously unrecognized pathway involving NK-cell derived IL-13 and non-specific B-cell activation and underscore the significance of environmental exposures in shaping immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

This study conducts a systematic review with meta-analysis of secondary fungal infections (SFIs) associated with COVID-19 considering various significant parameters, such as the frequency of SFIs across the globe, species shift, gender-specific infection rates, the significance of medical history, efficacy of steroid and antifungal, treatment outcomes (mortality rate), and fungal-polymicrobial mortality analysis. Methods: A literature search was conducted on COVID-19-related fungal infection studies (2020-2024) from SCOPUS and PUBMED databases, excluding preprints. The systematic data extraction captured the PMCID, country, patient demographics (age and gender), clinical outcomes, associated pathogens, medical history, and treatment details. Findings: The global meta-analysis of COVID-19-associated SFIs yielded 10,700 cases across 58 countries, exhibiting a significant male predominance (65.6% vs. 34.3% female). Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., and Mucorales spp. emerged as the primary fungal pathogens. The predominant six countries marking 80 % of global cases include India (46.8 %), Italy (10 %), Iran (9.4 %), France (5.1 %), Spain (4.3 %), and Egypt (4.1 %). Complication rates revealed CAM as the most prevalent (59.2%), with a 28% mortality rate. CAC (21.6%) and CAPA (19.1%) had substantially higher mortality rates, at 54% and 58%, respectively. Specific populations were highly affected, including individuals with diabetes were prone to CAM, those undergone catheterization were at increased risk of CAC, and individuals with respiratory diseases or without prior medical history were susceptible to CAPA. In both CAC and CAPA, the species shift towards the non-albicans spp. and non-fumigatus spp., associated with higher mortality. In addition, polymicrobial infection with fungal pathogens (Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Mucorales spp.) and Multi-bacteria ( K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. aureus) also increased the mortality rate. Effective treatments were identified, including combining caspofungin with corticosteroids for CAC, voriconazole with dexamethasone for CAPA, and AmBisome monotherapy for CAM. Interpretation: In SFIs populations, CAM prevailed in high-density areas with relatively lower mortality rates, whereas CAC and CAPA exhibited higher mortality rates. Notably, polymicrobial infections significantly increased mortality across all SFIs. Underlying medical conditions primarily influenced the type of fungal pathogen, but treatment outcomes varied. Azole drugs and Amphotericin-B were ineffective against Candidiasis, except for caspofungin's limited susceptibility. Voriconazole and AmBisome demonstrated efficacy against Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis, respectively. Additionally, steroid administration proved life-saving in CAPA and CAC cases, yet remained ineffective in CAM.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

We present here the discovery and characterization of a small molecule chemical inducer of proximity that activates mutant p53. We named this compound TRanscriptional Activator of p53 (TRAP-1) due to its ability to engage mutant p53 and BRD4 in a ternary complex, which potently activates mutant p53 and triggers robust p53 target gene transcription. Treatment of p53Y220C expressing pancreatic cell lines with TRAP-1 results in rapid upregulation of p21 and other p53 target genes and inhibits the growth of p53Y220C-expressing cell lines. Negative control compounds that are unable to form a ternary complex do not have these effects, demonstrating the necessity of chemically induced proximity for the observed pharmacology. This approach to activating mutant p53 highlights how chemically induced proximity can be used to restore the functions of tumor suppressor proteins that have been inactivated by mutation in cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Multi-omics analysis of samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected persons aged 1 to 84 years, revealed a rewiring of type I interferon (IFN) signaling with a gradual shift from signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to STAT3 activation in monocytes, CD4+ T cells and B cells with increasing age. Diversion of interferon IFN signaling was associated with increased expression of inflammatory markers, enhanced release of inflammatory cytokines, and delayed contraction of infection-induced CD4+ T cells. A shift from IFN-responsive germinal center B (GCB) cells towards CD69high GCB and atypical B cells corresponded to the formation of IgA in children while complement fixing IgG was dominant in adults.

Obesity and overweight have furthermore been shown to relate to structural brain alterations. Post-COVID condition (PCC) has in turn been associated with structural brain alterations and lingering immunological changes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess whether obesity contributes to structural brain alterations and differences in immunological markers in PCC patients. Methods: We investigated a previously established cohort of PCC patients (n = 61). Whole-brain comparison of gray matter volume (GMV) was conducted by voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), as well as age, gender and total intracranial volume (TIV) were included as regressors in a linear regression model. Results: A significant negative association was found between higher BMI and lower GMV in the right thalamus (p(FWE) = 0.039, k = 209, TFCE = 1037.97, x = 18, y = -21, z = 8). Moreover, BMI, GMV and immunological markers were linked in PCC. Specifically, BMI was primarily positively associated with Interleukin-6 and negatively with Interleukin-7, while GMV showed strong positive associations with Interleukin-8. Limitations: A small cohort size and no available data on BMI changes before and after SARS-CoV2 infection limit the interpretation of our findings. Conclusion: The results suggest that BMI contributes to GMV alterations in PCC patients, with both BMI and GMV being associated with peripheral immunological markers. These findings indicate that converging mechanisms, such as inflammation and structural brain alterations, may play a role in obesity and PCC.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

Methodological disparities in quantifying and mapping 6mA in genomic DNA have fueled this controversy. Yet, the distantly related early branching fungi, ciliates and the algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibit robust 6mA methylation patterns, but the origin and evolution of 6mA remain unknown. Here we use Oxford Nanopore modified base calling to profile 6mA at base pair resolution in 18 unicellular eukaryotes spanning all major eukaryotic supergroups. Our results reveal that only species encoding the adenine methyltransferase AMT1 display robust genomic 6mA patterns. Notably, 6mA consistently accumulates downstream of transcriptional start sites, aligning with H3K4me3-enriched nucleosomes, suggesting a conserved role in placing transcriptionally permissive nucleosomes. Intriguingly, the recurrent loss of the 6mA pathway across eukaryotes, particularly in major multicellular lineages, implies a convergent alteration in the dual methylation system of the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, which featured transcription-associated 6mA and repression-associated 5mC.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Diminished capacity for DNA repair is linked to many human diseases, therefore understanding the molecular pathways responding to DNA damage is key for developing novel therapies. Lack of unbiased probes to report DNA damage dynamics and the associated proteins in living cells and animals limit our current efforts to completely understand DNA repair processes. In this study we overcome these limitations by engineering protein probes containing the tandem-BRCT domain of MCPH1, which we show to have a specific affinity for the DNA-damage-associated histone mark {gamma}H2AX. We employ these probes to track DNA damage dynamics in living cells exposed to a panel of different genotoxic insults and to visualize programmed double strand breaks during gametogenesis in living animals. We further utilize the binding selectivity of our probe to tether TurboID biotin ligases to chromatin and identify the DNA damage-associated proteome via proximity ligation. By comparing five different DNA damaging agents, we reveal the proteome associated with specific lesions, and identify multiple novel proteins with potential implications in damage response and repair. Among these novel proteins, we characterize the ubiquitin ligase UBE3A, the methyl-binding and proteasome-recruiting protein L3MBTL3, and the spliceosomal factor U2SURP, as previously uncharacterized effectors of DNA damage response. These functional datasets reveal the DNA damage-dependent proteomes and reveal novel insights into DNA damage response.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Yet, for many pathogens we know exceptionally little about their epidemiological and population dynamics, and this knowledge gap is slowing the development of efficient control strategies. Here we study the population genomics and molecular epidemiology of wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici (Bgt). We sampled Bgt for two consecutive years, 2022 and 2023, from 22 countries in Europe and surrounding regions, and compiled a genomic dataset of 415 Bgt isolates. We found one single epidemic unit in the north of Europe, consisting of a highly homogeneous population. Conversely, the south of Europe hosts smaller local populations which are less interconnected. In addition, we show that the population structure can be largely predicted by the prevalent wind patterns. We identified several loci that were under selection in the recent past, including fungicide targets and avirulence genes. Some of these loci are common between populations, while others are not, suggesting different local selective pressures. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of one of these loci, AvrPm17, coding for an effector recognized by the wheat receptor Pm17. We found evidence for a soft sweep on standing genetic variation. Multiple AvrPm17 haplotypes, which can partially escape recognition by Pm17, spread rapidly throughout the continent upon its introduction in the early 2000s. We also identified a new virulent variant, which emerged more recently and can evade Pm17 resistance altogether. Overall, we highlight the potential of genomic surveillance in resolving the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of agricultural pathogens, as well as in guiding control strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Ontogeny has therefore become a problematic confounding variable in vertebrate paleontology, especially in study systems distant from extant crown clades, rendering taxonomic hypothesis testing (a fundamental process in evolutionary biology) rife with difficulty. Paleontologists have adopted quantitative methods to compensate for the perception that juvenile specimens lack diagnostic apomorphies seen in their adult conspecifics. Here, I critically evaluate these methods and the assumptions that guide their interpretation using a CT dataset comprising growth series of American and Chinese alligator. I find that several widespread assumptions are scientifically unjustifiable, and that two popular methods--geometric morphometrics and cladistic analysis of ontogeny--have unacceptably high rates of type II error and present numerous procedural difficulties. However, I also identify a suite of ontogenetically invariant characters that differentiate the living species of Alligator throughout ontogeny. These characters overwhelmingly correspond to anatomical systems that develop prior to (and play a signaling role in) the development of the cranial skeleton itself, suggesting that their ontogenetic invariance is a consequence of the widely conserved vertebrate developmental program. These observations suggest that the architecture of the cranium is fixed early in embryonic development, and that ontogenetic remodeling does not alter the topological relationships of the cranial bones or the soft tissue structures they house. I propose a general model for future taxonomic hypothesis tests in the fossil record, in which the hypothesis that two specimens different ontogenetic stages of a single species can be falsified by the discovery of character differences that cannot be attributed plausibly to ontogenetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, restriction inactivation upon growth at high temperatures was previously described, however, which system is being inactivated, the underlying mechanism, as well as the timing of recovery, remain unknown. Here, we report that P. aeruginosa Type I methyltransferase (HsdMS) and restriction endonuclease (HsdR) components are degraded by two Lon-like proteases when replicating above 41 {degrees}C, which induces partial genome hypomethylation and simultaneously prevents self-targeting, respectively. Interestingly, upon return to 37 {degrees}C, methyltransferase activity returns gradually, with restriction activity not fully recovering for over 60 bacterial generations, representing the longest bacterial memory to our knowledge. Forced expression of HsdR over the first 45 generations is toxic, demonstrating the fitness benefit of HsdR inactivation. Our findings demonstrate that type I R-M is tightly regulated post-translationally with a remarkable memory effect to ensure genomic stability and emphasize the importance of mitigating auto-toxicity for bacterial defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

In maximising the predictive performance of PGS, neural-network (NN) based deep learning has emerged as a method of intense interest to model complex, nonlinear phenomena, which may be adapted to exploit gene-gene (GxG) and gene-environment (GxE) interactions.

MethodsTo infer the amount of nonlinearity present in a phenotype, we present a framework for using NNs, which controls for the potential confounding effect of correlation between genetic variants, i.e. linkage disequilibrium (LD). We fit NN models to both simulated traits and 28 real disease and anthropometric traits in the UK Biobank.

ResultsSimulations confirmed that our framework adequately controls LD and can infer nonlinear effects, when such effects genuinely exist. Using this approach on real data, we found evidence for small amounts of nonlinearity due to GxG and GxE which mildly improved prediction performance (r2) by [~]7% and [~]4%, respectively. Despite evidence for nonlinear effects, NN models were outperformed by linear regression models for both genetic-only and genetic+environmental input scenarios with [~]7% and [~]5% differences in r2, respectively. Importantly, we found substantial evidence for confounding by joint tagging effects, whereby inferred GxG was actually LD with due to unaccounted for additive genetic variants.

ConclusionOur results indicate that the usefulness of NNs for generating polygenic scores for common traits and diseases may currently be limited and may be confounded by joint tagging effects due to LD.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

Here, we determined electron cryo-microscopy structures of CpaF in three distinct conformations and nucleotide occupancies. Packing unit analyses revealed differences in nucleotide coordination in the active sites, as well as synchronized domain movements during the catalytic cycle. Alphafold3 modeling demonstrated that CpaF and other motors within the type IV filament superfamily use a similar binding interface to engage their respective platform proteins.

Recently, a novel  pre-atrophy muscle weakness was identified during early-stage cancer. While mitochondrial stress responses are associated with early-stage pre-atrophy weakness, a causal relationship has not been established. Using a robust mouse model of metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)-induced cachexia, we found the well-established mitochondrial-targeted plastoquinone SkQ1 partially prevents pre-atrophy weakness in the diaphragm. Furthermore, SkQ1 improved force production during atrophy without preventing atrophy itself in the tibialis anterior and diaphragm. EOC reduced flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) force production and myoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) during contraction in single muscle fibers, both of which were prevented by SkQ1. Remarkably, changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and pyruvate metabolism were heterogeneous across time and between muscle types which highlights a considerable complexity in the relationships between mitochondria and muscle remodeling throughout EOC. These discoveries identify that muscle weakness can occur independent of atrophy throughout EOC in a manner that is linked to improved calcium handling. The findings also demonstrate that mitochondrial-targeted therapies exert a robust effect in preserving muscle force during the early pre-atrophy period and in late-stage EOC once cachexia has become severe.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

This process is thought to be mediated by neurons organized as attractor networks1,2. However, whether attractor dynamics underlie decision behavior and the complex neuronal responses remains unclear. Here we use an unsupervised, deep learning-based method to discover decision-related dynamics from the simultaneous activity of neurons in frontal cortex and striatum of rats while they accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes, the first dominated by sensory inputs, and the second dominated by the autonomous dynamics, with flow in a direction (i.e., ""neural mode"") largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that the second regime corresponds to decision commitment. We developed a simplified model that approximates the coupled transition in dynamics and neural mode and allows precise inference, from each trials neural activity, of a putative internal decision commitment time in that trial. The simplified model captures diverse and complex single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3-5. It also captures trial-averaged curved trajectories6-8, and reveals distinctions between brain regions. The putative neurally-inferred commitment times (""nTc"") occurred at times broadly distributed across trials, and not time-locked to stimulus onset, offset, or response onset. Nevertheless, when trials were aligned to nTc, behavioral analysis showed that, as predicted by a decision commitment time, sensory evidence before nTc affected the subjects decision, but evidence after nTc did not. Our results show that the formation of a perceptual choice involves a rapid, coordinated transition in both the dynamical regime and the neural mode of the decision process, and suggest the moment of commitment to be a useful entry point for dissecting mechanisms underlying rapid changes in internal state.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Here, we utilized a systems-biology approach to define the early metabolic and transcriptional signatures to gain mechanistic insight into the pathways contributing to HFpEF development.

MethodsMale ZSF1-obese, ZSF1-lean hypertensive controls, and WKY (wild-type) controls were compared at 14w of age for extensive physiological phenotyping and LV tissue harvesting for unbiased metabolomics, RNA-sequencing, and assessment of mitochondrial morphology and function. Utilizing ZSF1-lean and WKY controls enabled a distinction between hypertension-driven molecular changes contributing to HFpEF pathology, versus hypertension + metabolic syndrome.

ResultsZSF1-obese rats displayed numerous clinical features of HFpEF. Comparison of ZSF1-lean vs WKY (i.e., hypertension-exclusive effects) revealed metabolic remodeling suggestive of increased aerobic glycolysis, decreased {beta}-oxidation, and dysregulated purine and pyrimidine metabolism with few transcriptional changes. ZSF1-obese rats displayed worsened metabolic remodeling and robust transcriptional remodeling highlighted by the upregulation of inflammatory genes and downregulation of the mitochondrial structure/function and cellular metabolic processes. Integrated network analysis of metabolomic and RNAseq datasets revealed downregulation of nearly all catabolic pathways contributing to energy production, manifesting in a marked decrease in the energetic state (i.e., reduced ATP/ADP, PCr/ATP). Cardiomyocyte ultrastructure analysis revealed decreased mitochondrial area, size, and cristae density, as well as increased lipid droplet content in HFpEF hearts. Mitochondrial function was also impaired as demonstrated by decreased substrate-mediated respiration and dysregulated calcium handling.

Whereas this effect has been mostly explained in terms of weakening cognitive control, cognitive effort may also bias behavioral choices by amplifying the hedonic and emotional impact of rewards. We report parallel findings with animals and humans supporting this hypothesis. In rats, exerting cognitive effort immediately before access to cocaine self-administration significantly increased drug intake. In addition, exerting cognitive effort increased the psychostimulant effect of cocaine. The effects of cognitive effort on addiction-related behaviors were eliminated and even reversed when animals could rest in their home-cage for 2-4h before access to cocaine self-administration. Among humans, we found that expending cognitive effort increased consumption of tasty (but unhealthy) food by increasing the hedonic enjoyment of consuming the food. In addition, the effects were specific for emotionally relevant stimuli (i.e., food rewards) and did not generalize to judgment about neutral objects. Altogether these data suggest that intense cognitive effort can increase the perceived intensity of rewards and lead to their overconsumption. This effect may contribute to bad decision making induced by excessive cognitive effort and make people more vulnerable to indulge in unhealthy behaviors such as use of addictive drugs.

Significance StatementPeople dieting or recovering from addiction frequently report that relapses occur during periods of stress and mental fatigue. Multiple processes may contribute to this, including beliefs about the stress-reducing effects of drugs, beliefs about ones inability to continue resisting, and lack of energy needed to sustain resistance. Here, we suggest an additional possible process: during a state of mental fatigue, rewards become all the more satisfying, thereby also increasing subsequent desire for them. We report two lines of experiments, one with rats and one with human participants, to show that intense cognitive effort leads to increased enjoyment of rewards and hence increased consumption.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

We estimated population-level immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for each of the fifty United States (U.S.) and the District of Columbia from January 2020 through December 2023.

MethodsWe updated a model of SARS-CoV-2 infections to align with the latest evidence on SARS-CoV-2 natural history and waning of immunity, and to integrate various data sources available throughout the pandemic. We used this model to produce population estimates of effective protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease.

ResultsOn December 30, 2023, 99.9% of the U.S. population had experienced immunological exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through infection and/or vaccination, with 99.4% (95% credible interval (CrI): 92.4-100%) having had at least one SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite this high exposure, the average population-level protection against infection was 53.6% (95% CrI: 38.7-71.5%). Population-level protection against severe disease was 82.6% (95% CrI: 71.5-91.7%).

DiscussionA new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations began near the end of 2023, with the introduction of the JN.1 variant. This upturn suggests that the U.S. population remains at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease despite the high level of cumulative exposure in the United States. This decline in effective protection is likely due to both waning and continued viral evolution.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

The anatomical position and physiological roles of the liver suggest it is a prime candidate to serve as an interoceptive sensor of peripheral tissue and systemic energy state. Importantly, maintenance of liver ATP levels and within-meal food intake inhibition is impaired in human subjects with obesity and obese pre-clinical models. We demonstrate that decreased hepatic mitochondrial energy metabolism in liver-specific, heterozygous PGC1a mice results in reduced mitochondrial response to changes in {Delta}GATP and tissue ATP following fasting. These impairments in liver energy state are associated with larger and longer meals during chow feeding, impaired dose-dependent food intake inhibition in response to mixed and individual nutrient oral pre-loads, and greater acute fasting-induced food intake.

They are often associated with clinical phenotypes, including autosomal dominant diseases driven by haploinsufficiency. Recent analyses using biobanks have suggested that LoF penetrance for some haploinsufficient disorders may be low, an observation that has important implications for population genomic screening. However, biobanks are also rife with missing data, and the reliability of these findings remains uncertain. Here, we examine the penetrance of putative LoFs (pLoFs) using a cohort of {approx}24,000 carriers derived from two population-scale biobanks: the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program. We investigate several possible etiologies for reduced pLoF penetrance, including biobank recruitment biases, annotation artifacts, missed diagnoses, and incomplete clinical records. Systematically accounting for these factors increased penetrance, but widespread reduced penetrance remained. Therefore, we hypothesized that other factors must be driving this phenomenon. To test this, we trained machine learning models to identify pLoFs with high penetrance using the genomic features specific to each variant. These models were predictive of penetrance across a range of diseases and pLoF types, including those with prior evidence for pathogenicity. This suggests that reduced pLoF penetrance is in fact common, and care should be taken when counseling asymptomatic carriers.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

Predicting the effect of up or down gene regulation or drug treatment on the gene expression profile of a cell can open avenues in understanding biological mechanisms and potentially treating disease. Most foundation models for single-cell biology learn from scRNA-seq counts, using experimental data as a modality to generate gene representations. Similarly, the scientific literature holds a plethora of information that can be used in generating gene representations using a different modality - language - as the basis. In this work, we study the effect of using both language and experimental data in modeling genes for perturbation prediction. We show that textual representations of genes provide additive and complementary value to gene representations learned from experimental data alone in predicting perturbation outcomes for single-cell data. We find that textual representations alone are not as powerful as biologically learned gene representations, but can serve as useful prior information. We show that different types of scientific knowledge represented as language induces different types of prior knowledge. For example, in the datasets we study, subcellular location helps the most for predicting the effect of single-gene perturbations, and protein information helps the most for modeling perturbation effects of interactions of combinations of genes. We validate our findings by extending the popular scGPT model, a foundation model trained on scRNA-seq counts, to incorporate language embeddings at the gene level. We start with NCBI gene card and UniProt protein summaries from the genePT approach and add gene function annotations from the Gene Ontology (GO). We name our model ""scGenePT"", representing the combination of ideas from these two models. Our work sheds light on the value of integrating multiple sources of knowledge in modeling single-cell data, highlighting the effect of language in enhancing biological representations learned from experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

We demonstrate that oral supplementation of ILA impacts key MS disease processes in two preclinical models. ILA reduces neuroinflammation by dampening immune cell activation/ infiltration; and promotes remyelination and in vitro oligodendrocyte differentiation through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Supplementation of ILA, a reductive indole metabolite, restores the gut microbiome's oxidative/reductive metabolic balance by lowering circulating indole acetate (IAA), an oxidative indole metabolite, that blocks remyelination and oligodendrocyte maturation. The ILA-induced reduction in circulating IAA is linked to changes in IAA-producing gut microbiota taxa and pathways that are also dysregulated in MS. Notably, a lower ILA:IAA ratio correlates with worse MS outcomes. Overall, these findings identify ILA as a new potential anti-inflammatory remyelinating agent and provide novel insights into the role of gut dysbiosis-related metabolic alterations in MS progression.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Recently, the string-pulling task - which involves cyclically reaching, grasping and pulling a string - has been used to study coordinated hand movements in rodents and humans. Here we characterize how adult common marmosets perform the string-pulling task and describe changes in performance across the lifespan. Marmosets (n=15, 7 female) performed a string-pulling task for a food reward using an instrumented apparatus attached to their home-cage. Movement kinematics were acquired using markerless video tracking and we assessed individual hand movements and bimanual coordination using standard metrics. Marmosets appeared to guide their actions with vision and readily performed the string-pulling task regardless of sex or age. The task required very little training and animals routinely engaged in multiple pulling trials per session despite not being under water or food control. All marmosets showed consistent pulling speed and similar hand movements regardless of age. Adult marmosets exhibited a clear hand effect, performing straighter and faster movements with their right hand despite showing idiosyncratic hand preference according to a traditional food retrieval assay. Hand effects were also evident for younger animals but seemed attenuated in the older animals. In terms of bimanual coordination, all adult marmosets demonstrated an alternating movement pattern for vertical hand positions. Two younger and two older marmosets exhibited idiosyncratic coordination patterns even after substantial experience. In general, younger and older animals exhibited higher variability in bimanual coordination than did adults.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

While there are inherent costs to reproduction, behavioral interactions among individuals are often the primary drivers of reproductive costs. Males frequently compete for territories and females; females may compete for food or males; males often harass females. Here, we sought to determine whether reproductive costs were primarily due to male/male competition, female/female competition, or male/female interactions in the bluefin killifish. In this species, males guard small spawning territories where females visit them daily to spawn. To manipulate the potential for male and female competition and male/female interactions, we altered the sex ratio and density of each sex across four treatments (1 male: 1 female, 1 male : 3 females, 3 males: 1 female, 3 males: 3 females). Female mortality was higher than male mortality. Surprisingly, female mortality and male aggressive behaviors towards females (i.e., chases) were highest in treatments with a single male. Male-male aggression was present, but males often resolved these disputes via signaling by flaring their fins. There was little evidence for overt aggression among females. When males lack rivals, they turn their territorial defense towards females. These costs help explain why, in nature, females promptly leave male territories following spawning and join loose shoals with conspecific females and minnows.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

The advent of the AI folding era has unleashed millions of high-quality predicted structures, motivating the development and assessment of scalable multiple structure alignment (MStA) methods.

Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we tracked the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential targets during search. We show how we look back into memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time required for visual verification.

Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint blockage on T cells, has revolutionized cancer treatment. T-cell exhaustion is an abnormal activation state that develops when continuous exposure to antigens, like cancer. In this context, recent evidence suggests that parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) plays a previously underappreciated role in fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Further, blocking PTHrP activity reduces primary tumor growth, prevents metastasis, and prolongs survival in mice with various cancers. Here, we confirm that administration of anti-PTHrP monoclonal antibodies can reduce the growth of B16-PDL1 melanoma tumors and that although the therapy did not alter the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ TILs, we noted that all stages of T-cell exhaustion were reduced. Further, the expression of cytolytic proteins PERFORIN and GZMB also increased. By contrast, anti-PTHrP therapy increased the relative presence of pre-pro B cells with a decline in mature B cells in the bone marrow.

Tools such as standardized cognitive tests and symptom inventories have played a crucial role in informing neuroimaging studies, helping to uncover the underlying brain systems associated with these measures. Substantial strides have been taken in developing models, such as connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), that establish connections between external measures and the human connectome, offering insights into how the functional organization of the brain varies in relation to scores on external measures. Here, we depart from the conventional feed-forward approach and introduce a feed-back approach that allows testing of the tests. Since the inception of cognitive psychology over 60 years ago, cognitive tests have been meticulously developed to measure specific components of cognition. These tests, which have undergone extensive validation and have been standardized and administered to millions, operate on explicit assumptions about the cognitive components they assess. Rather than using external tests to identify the circuits supporting test scores, we a priori define networks of interest and quantify the extent to which these circuits support the test measure. To demonstrate this, we define functional connectivity networks for six cognitive constructs and quantify their contribution to performance across a spectrum of standardized cognitive tests and clinical measures. Employing robust machine learning in a predictive modeling framework, we show how this approach can be used to select tests according to the networks they rely upon. This establishes a biologically grounded metric for test comparison. This approach also yields a brain-driven process for forming composite tests by selecting test combinations that depend on the same proportional brain systems, or for a single network of interest, combining tests with the highest predictive power for that network. This brain-driven approach results in more robust behavioral assessments and enhanced predictive power for the network of interest. We illustrate how this methodology can be applied to evaluate the inclusion of specific sub-tests within a composite score, revealing instances where composite scores are reinforced or weakened by subtest inclusion in terms of the specificity of the brain network they interrogate. The brain-test score modeling approach presented here provides a biologically driven approach to the selection of external cognitive and symptom measures directed at specific brain systems. It opens new avenues of research by providing a framework for the development of new tests and measures guided by quantitative brain metrics.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Fission, in particular, depends on the accumulation of the mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) and subsequent recruitment of the dynamin-related protein Drp1. We used cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (cryo-STET) to investigate mitochondrial morphologies in MFF mutant cells (MFF-/-) in ATP-depleting conditions that normally induce fission. The capability of cryo-STET to image through the cytoplasmic volume to a depth of 1 {micro}m provides visualization of mitochondria and their surroundings intact. We imaged changes in mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure and contacts with endoplasmic reticulum, degradative organelles, and cytoskeleton at stalled fission sites. We found disruption of the outer membrane at contact sites with endoplasmic reticulum and degradative organelles at sites of mitophagy. We identified fission sites where the inner mitochondrial membrane is already separated while the outer is still continuous. While MFF is a general fission factor, these observations demonstrate that mitochondrial fission can proceed to the final stage in its absence. The use of cryo-STET allays concerns about the loss of structures due to sample thinning required for cryo-TEM tomography.

Summary StatementImaging the whole cytosol in three dimensions greatly aids in understanding cellular processes.

Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of cortical areas with a precise laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between pyramidal, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical pyramidal-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Here we show that the RNA-targeting type VI-A CRISPR system of Listeria seeligeri acquires spacers from DNA substrates through the action of a promiscuous Cas1-2 integrase encoded by a co-occurring type II-C system, in a transcription-independent manner.

Despite their importance, most of all current ecological theories have been formalized focusing on negative interactions such as competition or predation. The role of cooperation, or other types of positive interactions including facilitation and mutualism, has not been fully addressed, or, if so, always in combination with negative interactions. This fact limits our understanding of the unique features by which cooperation as opposed to competition promotes biodiversity. To address this gap, we introduce here cooperation into structural stability, a general framework to understand how species interactions and environmental variability determine the long-term persistence of species within communities. Compared to a pure competitive case, cooperation promotes three distinctive features. First, cooperation increases the opportunities for species to coexist. This feature increases the persistence of species with contrasted phylogenetic, functional, and demographic strategies that the environment would otherwise filter. Second, cooperation creates intertwined biodiversity where the existence of some species begets the presence of others. Third, cooperation promotes multistability by changing the dynamics of community assembly due to variations in environmental conditions. In conclusion, we present a fully operational framework to understand the unique ecological roles of cooperation in nature. It indicates that cooperation as opposed to competition maximizes the maintenance of biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

The UPR is transduced by three ER-resident sensors of ER homeostasis disruption in the lumen of this compartment. They trigger select downstream signaling pathways in the cytosol and nucleus. Among them, IRE1 (referred to as IRE1 hereafter), a type I transmembrane protein, senses accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the ER lumen and transduces signals through both kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activities in the cytosol. IRE1 catalyzes XBP1 mRNA unconventional splicing and RNA degradation (Regulated IRE1 Dependent Decay, termed RIDD). Recent studies have reported that IRE1-dependent protein-protein interactions (PPi) drive additional non-canonical IRE1 functions. Herein, we define the IRE1 signalosome as a list of IRE1 binding partners (direct or not) which alter IRE1 signaling towards XBP1 mRNA splicing and RIDD. Here we determined the IRE1 in situ interactome using BioID, putatively connecting IRE1 to previously unrecognized cellular functions.

An impairment in the ability to understand and generate the correct grammatical structures (syntactic deficit) has been suggested as a key contributor; but studies have been underpowered, often with conflicting findings. It is also unclear if syntactic deficits are restricted to a subgroup of patients, or generalized across the broad spectrum of patients irrespective of symptom profiles, age, sex, and illness severity. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered on OSF, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, searching multiple databases up to May 1, 2024. We extracted effect sizes (Cohen's d) and variance differences (log coefficient of variation ratio) across 6 domains: 2 in comprehension (understanding complex syntax, detection of syntactic errors) and 4 in production (global complexity, phrasal/clausal complexity, utterance length, and integrity) in patient-control comparisons. Study quality/bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Bayesian meta-analysis was used to estimate domain-specific effects and variance differences. We tested for potential moderators with sufficient data (age, sex, study quality, language spoken) using conventional meta-regression to estimate the sources of heterogeneity between studies. Findings Overall, 45 studies (n=2960 unique participants, 64.4% English, 79 case-control contrasts, weighted mean age(sd)=32.3(5.6)) were included. Of the patient samples, only 29.2% were women. Bayesian meta-analysis revealed extreme evidence for all syntactic domains to be affected in schizophrenia with a large-sized effect (model-averaged d=0.65-1.01, with overall random effects d=0.86, 95% CrI [0.67-1.03]). Syntactic comprehension was the most affected domain. There was notable heterogeneity between studies in global complexity (moderated by the age), production integrity (moderated by study quality), and production length. Robust BMA revealed weak evidence for publication bias. Patients had a small-to-medium-sized excess of inter-individual variability than healthy controls in understanding complex syntax, and in producing long utterances and complex phrases (overall random effects lnCVR=0.21, 95% CrI [0.07-0.36]), hinting at the possible presence of subgroups with diverging syntactic performance. Interpretation There is robust evidence for the presence of grammatical impairment in comprehension and production in schizophrenia. This knowledge will improve the measurement of communication disturbances in schizophrenia and aid in developing distinct interventions focussed on syntax - a rule-based feature that is potentially amenable to cognitive, educational, and linguistic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811971

We show that the H3K36me3 methyltransferase SETD2 is important for the establishment of neuronal gene expression during late stages of differentiation, but is dispensable once the cells have fully differentiated. This function is largely independent of the histone methyltransferase activity. By measuring the protein interaction network of elongating RNA Pol II, we identify a novel role for SETD2 in mediating interactions between the PAF1 complex and the elongating RNA Pol II, which is required to ensure optimal transcriptional processivity of neuronal genes.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

While some satellite DNA types have well-established roles in centromere biology, other abundant satellite DNAs have poorly characterized functions. For example, Human Satellite 3 (HSat3), which makes up roughly 2% of the human genome, forms enormous arrays up to tens of megabases, but these arrays play no known roles in centromere function and were almost fully excluded from genome assemblies until recently. As a result, these massive genomic regions have remained relatively understudied, and the potential functional roles of HSat3 have remained largely unknown. To address this, we performed a systematic screen for novel HSat3 binding factors. Our work revealed HSat3 arrays contain high densities of transcription factor (TF) motifs that are bound by factors related to multiple, highly conserved signaling pathways. Unexpectedly, the most enriched TFs in HSat3 belong to the Hippo pathway transcription effector family TEAD. We found that TEAD recruits the co-activator YAP to HSat3 regions in a cell-state specific manner. Using RNA polymerase-I reporter assays, targeted repression of HSat3, inducible degradation of YAP, and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HSat3 arrays can localize YAP/TEAD inside the nucleolus, where YAP regulates RNA Polymerase-I activity. Beyond revealing a direct relationship between the Hippo pathway and ribosomal DNA regulation, this work demonstrates that satellite DNA can encode multiple transcription factor binding motifs, defining a new role for these enormous genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

However, systematic noise, often introduced by low-quality cells, can obscure biological signals if not properly accounted for. Thus, one of the common quality control steps involves filtering out cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial RNA counts (pctMT), as high pctMT typically indicates cell death. Yet, commonly used filtering thresholds, primarily derived from studies on healthy tissues, may be overly stringent for malignant cells, which often naturally exhibit higher baseline mitochondrial gene expression. We analyzed public single-cell RNA-seq and spatial data to investigate if malignant cells with high pctMT are viable and functionally significant subpopulations.

ResultsWe analyzed nine single-cell RNA-seq datasets from uveal melanoma, breast, lung, kidney, head and neck, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, including 439,507 cells from 151 patients. Malignant cells exhibited significantly higher pctMT than nonmalignant cells without a significant increase in dissociation-induced stress signature scores. Malignant cells with high pctMT showed metabolic dysregulation, including increased xenobiotic metabolism, which is implicated in cancer therapeutic response. Our analysis of pctMT in cancer cell lines uncovered associations with resistance and sensitivity to certain classes of drugs. Additionally, we observed a link between pctMT and malignant cell transcriptional heterogeneity as well as patient clinical features.

ConclusionsThis study provides a detailed exploration of the functional characteristics of malignant cells with elevated pctMT, challenging current quality control practices in single-cell RNA-seq analyses of tumors. Our findings have the potential to improve data interpretation and refine the biological conclusions of future cancer studies.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

However, immune efficiency is constrained by Cas9 off-target cleavages and toxicity. How bacteria regulate Cas9 to maximize protection while preventing autoimmunity is not understood. Here, we show that the master regulator of virulence, CovR, regulates CRISPR-Cas9 immunity against mobile genetic elements in Streptococcus agalactiae, a pathobiont responsible for invasive neonatal infections. We show that CovR binds to and represses a distal promoter of the cas operon, integrating immunity within the virulence regulatory network. The CovR-regulated promoter provides a controlled increase in off-target cleavages to counteract mutations in the target DNA, restores the potency of old immune memory, and stimulates the acquisition of new memory in response to recent infections. Regulation of Cas9 by CovR is conserved at the species level, with lineage specificities suggesting different adaptive trajectories. Altogether, we describe the coordinated regulation of immunity and virulence that enhances the bacterial immune repertoire during host-pathogen interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

By conducting a screening of a subset of the FDA-approved drugs, we found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, also known as tretinoin) caused ADAR1 protein degradation through ubiquitin-proteasome pathways and concomitantly increased PD-L1 expression in pancreatic and breast cancers.

Understanding the structure of these RBPs can provide insights into their target interactions. Tail fibers, a prominent type of RBP, are typically elongated, flexible, and trimeric proteins, making it challenging to obtain high-resolution experimental data of their full-length structures. Recent advancements in deep learning-based protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold2-multimer (AF2M) and ESMfold, allow for the generation of high-confidence predicted models of complete tail fibers. In this paper, we introduce RBPseg, a method that combines monomeric ESMfold predictions with a novel sigmoid distance pair (sDp) protein segmentation technique. This method segments the tail fiber sequences into smaller fractions, preserving domain boundaries. These segments are then predicted in parallel using AF2M and assembled into a full fiber model. We demonstrate that RBPseg significantly improves AF2M v2.3.2 in terms of model confidence, running time, and memory usage. To validate our approach, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to analyze five tail fibers from three phages of the BASEL collection. Additionally, we conducted a structural classification of 67 fibers and their domains, which identified 16 well-defined tail fiber classes and 89 domains. Our findings suggest the existence of modular fibers as well as fibers with different sequences and shared structure, indicating possible sequence convergence, divergence, and domain swapping. We further demonstrate that these structural classes account for at least 24% of the known tail fiber universe.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

However, the defining triggers underlying these responses remain poorly understood. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has emerged as a primary risk factor for MS, suggesting a potential role for molecular mimicry in which EBV-specific immune responses cross-react with myelin antigens.

In this study, we analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of MS patients (n = 129) and controls (n = 94) from public datasets, to explore the relationship between EBV-specific and myelin-specific T cell responses. Our analysis identified clusters of TCRs that were significantly depleted among MS patients, many of which were associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV). By generating a library of myelin-reactive TCRs from stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from MS patients and mapping these sequences to the public TCR repertoire database, we also uncovered a lower frequency of myelin-reactive TCRs in MS samples compared to controls in the public datasets. In addition, epitope-specificity prediction revealed a broader response to EBV-, but not CMV-derived epitopes.

Collectively, these findings underscore the complex role of chronic viral infections in MS. Particularly, they suggest that EBV-specific immune responses contribute to the dysregulation of the immune system in MS patients, potentially through mechanisms of molecular mimicry. While the broader response to EBV-derived epitopes and the lower frequency of myelin-reactive TCRs in MS samples are both associated with the disease, further research is needed to clarify the nature of this relationship. These observations suggest that viral and autoimmune mechanisms may contribute independently or interact in MS pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Most genes associated with schizophrenia risk involve ubiquitous targets that may not explain delayed emergence of dopaminergic disruptions. This includes GRIN2A, the gene encoding the GluN2A subunit of the NMDA receptor. Both common and rare variants of GRIN2A are considered genetic risk factors for schizophrenia diagnosis. We find that Grin2a knockout in dopamine neurons during adolescence is sufficient to produce a behavioral phenotype that mirrors aspects of psychosis. These include disruptions in effort optimization, salience attribution, and ability to utilize feedback to guide behavior. We also find a selective effect of this manipulation on dopamine release during prediction error signaling. These data provide mechanistic insight into how variants of GRIN2A may lead to the latent presentation of aberrant salience and abnormalities in dopamine dynamics.

We found that the TIR protein, once it recognizes phage invasion, produces the previously unknown immune signaling molecule ADP-cyclo[N7:1'']-ribose (N7-cADPR). This molecule specifically activates the bacterial caspase-like protease which then indiscriminately degrades cellular proteins to halt phage replication. The TIR-caspase defense system, which we denote as type IV Thoeris, is abundant in bacteria and efficiently protects against phage propagation.

We found that transitions from cooler, wetter conditions to hotter, drier conditions accelerate season onset. Dry conditions (10th percentile of precipitation) in the spring shifted season onset an average of 2.8 weeks (95% CI: 0.43-3.58) earlier compared to wet conditions (90th percentile of precipitation). Conversely, transitions back to cooler, wetter conditions hastened season end, with dry fall conditions extending the season by an average of 0.69 weeks (95% CI: 0.37-1.41) compared to wet conditions. When dry conditions occurred in the spring and fall, the transmission season extended by 3.70 weeks (95% CI: 1.23-4.22).

The non-chromosomal inheritance of ecDNA during cell division is a major contributor to intratumoral genetic heterogeneity. At present, the spatial dynamics of ecDNA, and the impact on tumor evolutionary trajectories, are not well understood. Here, we investigate the spatial-temporal evolution of ecDNA and its clinical impact by analyzing tumor samples from 94 treatment-naive human IDH-wildtype glioblastoma patients. We developed a spatial-temporal computational model of ecDNA positive tumors ( SPECIES) that integrates whole-genome sequencing, multi-region DNA FISH, and nascent RNAscope, to provide unique insight into the spatial dynamics of ecDNA evolution. Random segregation in combination with positive selection of ecDNAs induce large, predictable spatial patterns of cell-to-cell ecDNA copy number variation that are highly dependent on the oncogene encoded on the circular DNA. EGFR ecDNAs often reach high mean copy number (mean of 50 copies per tumor cell), are under strong positive selection (mean selection coefficient, s > 2) and do not co-amplify other oncogenes on the same ecDNA particles. In contrast, PDGFRA ecDNAs have lower mean copy number (mean of 15 copies per cell), are under weaker positive selection and frequently co-amplify other oncogenes on the same ecDNA. Evolutionary modeling suggests that EGFR ecDNAs often accumulate prior to clonal expansion. EGFR structural variants, including vIII and c-terminal deletions are under strong positive selection, are found exclusively on ecDNA, and are intermixed with wild-type EGFR ecDNAs. Simulations show EGFRvIII ecDNA likely arises after ecDNA formation in a cell with high wild-type EGFR copy number (> 10) before the onset of the most recent clonal expansion. This remains true even in cases of co-selection and co-amplification of multiple oncogenic ecDNA species in a subset of patients. Overall, our results suggest a potential time window in which early ecDNA detection may provide an opportunity for more effective intervention.

We show that Malat1 is required for appropriate cytokine expression in female but not male Th2 cells. Malat1 deficiency impairs in vitro Th2 differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells from female mice, characterised by transcriptome-wide effects and suppression of cytokine expression, particularly IL10. Mechanistically, naive CD4+ T cells from Malat1-/- female mice demonstrate altered early activation kinetics, followed by impairment of the early differentiation gene expression programme, including up-regulation of an interferon responsive gene module. This is followed by suppression of IL2R and IL2R{gamma} expression and IL2-mediated differentiation. Male CD4+ T cell activation and Th2 differentiation are not sensitive to Malat1 loss due to stronger early activation, higher interferon responsive gene expression during early differentiation, maintenance of IL2R expression independently of Malat1, and lower sensitivity to exogenous IL2 during late differentiation. In vivo female, but not male, Malat1-/- mice demonstrate altered Th2 differentiation characterised by a reduction in IL10+ Th2 cells in both lung and spleen following priming and challenge with Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a model of lung type 2 inflammation. These findings reveal Malat1 as a determinant of immune sexual dimorphism.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agents effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between biological researchers across various fields with CRISPR genome engineering technology and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811971

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

HASTY (HST), a karyopherin protein, has been implicated in miRNA biogenesis and movement, though its role in non-cell-autonomous miRNA movement remains unclear. Through a genetic screen, we identified that mutations in the HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) gene suppress the developmental defects of hst mutants by restoring miRNA movement. Our findings show that HWS interacts with nuclear transport factors and nuclear pore complex (NPC) components, including NUP1, positioning HWS as a regulator of miRNA nuclear export. Using microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we showed that pri-miRNA transcription, and likely their co-transcriptional processing, occurs at the nuclear pore. Notably, we uncovered an antagonistic relationship between HST and HWS in regulating MIRNA transcription at the NPC and AGO1 loading, which could explain the observed changes in miRNA movement. HST promotes the association of MIRNA loci with the NPC, likely facilitating co-transcriptional processing, while HWS negatively regulates this process by targeting MEDIATOR complex subunits to degradation detaching, consequently, the processing complex from the NPC. Furthermore, our data provides evidence of spatial coordination of miRNA transcription, biogenesis, and movement highlighting a novel role for the NPC in the miRNA pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

However, real-time in vivo imaging of mitochondria in the brain is limited by existing dyes like MitoTrackers, which struggle with poor tissue penetration, phototoxicity, and inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study introduces Cy5-PEG4, a novel mitochondrial-targeting dye that overcomes these limitations, enabling high-resolution, non-invasive imaging of mitochondrial dynamics. Cy5-PEG4 effectively labels mitochondria in primary neuronal cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 RNYIAQVD peptide, revealing dose-dependent alterations in mitochondrial function that may contribute to COVID-19-related neurodegeneration. Importantly, Cy5-PEG4 crosses the BBB without causing neuroinflammation or toxicity, making it a safe tool for in vivo brain imaging and detailed studies of mitochondrial responses. In 3D cultured cells, Cy5-PEG4 captures dynamic changes in mitochondrial distribution and morphology as cell structures mature, highlighting its potential in neurobiological research, diagnostics, and therapeutic development. These findings support Cy5-PEG4 as a powerful tool for studying disease progression, identifying early biomarkers, and evaluating therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative disorders and COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Rodent tails are an abundantly diverse and more tractable system to understand mechanisms of vertebral growth and proportion. In many rodents, disproportionately long mid-tail vertebrae form a  crescendo-decrescendo of lengths in the tail series. In bipedal jerboas, these vertebrae grow exceptionally long such that the adult tail is 1.5x the length of a mouse tail, relative to body length, with four fewer vertebrae. How do vertebrae with the same regional identity elongate differently from their neighbors to establish and diversify adult proportion? Here, we find that vertebral lengths are largely determined by differences in growth cartilage height and the number of cells progressing through endochondral ossification. Hypertrophic chondrocyte size, a major contributor to differential elongation in mammal limb bones, differs only in the longest jerboa mid-tail vertebrae where they are exceptionally large. To uncover candidate molecular mechanisms of disproportionate vertebral growth, we performed intersectional RNA-Seq of mouse and jerboa tail vertebrae with similar and disproportionate elongation rates. Many regulators of posterior axial identity and endochondral elongation are disproportionately differentially expressed in jerboa vertebrae. Among these, the inhibitory natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR3) appears in multiple studies of rodent and human skeletal proportion suggesting it refines local growth rates broadly in the skeleton and broadly in mammals. Consistent with this hypothesis, NPR3 loss of function mice have abnormal tail and limb proportions. Therefore, in addition to genetic components of the complex process of vertebral evolution, these studies reveal fundamental mechanisms of skeletal growth and proportion.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Here, sampling healthy individuals, we profiled the kinetics and polyfunctionality of T cell immunity elicited by mRNA vaccination. Modeling of anti-spike T cell responses against ancestral and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that epitope immunodominance and cross-reactivity are major predictive determinants of T cell immunity. To identify immunodominant epitopes across the viral proteome, we generated a comprehensive map of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes within non-spike proteins that induced polyfunctional T cell responses in convalescent patients. We found that immunodominant epitopes mainly resided within regions that were minimally disrupted by mutations in emerging variants. Conservation analysis across historical human coronaviruses combined with in silico alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-spike proteins underscored the functional importance of mutationally-constrained immunodominant regions. Collectively, these findings identify immunodominant T cell epitopes across the mutationally-constrained SARS-CoV-2 proteome, potentially providing immune surveillance against emerging variants, and inform the design of next-generation vaccines targeting antigens throughout SARS-CoV-2 proteome for broader and more durable protection.

Foxi1 functions were predominantly studied in the context of ISC specification, however, reports indicate additional functions in early and ectodermal development. Here, we re-investigated the functions of Foxi1 in Xenopus laevis embryonic mucociliary epidermis development and found a novel function for Foxi1 in the generation of Notch-ligand expressing mucociliary multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We demonstrate that Foxi1 has multiple concentration-dependent functions: At low levels, Foxi1 confers ectodermal competence through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, while at high levels, Foxi1 induces a multi-step process of ISC specification and differentiation. We further describe how foxi1 expression is affected through auto- and Notch-regulation, how Ubp1 and Dmrt2 regulate ISC subtype differentiation, and how this developmental program affects Notch signaling as well as mucociliary patterning.

ObjectiveAssess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life.

DesignA follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction.

Participants526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID

Main measuresThe Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS

Key results71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsEvidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Existing tools primarily rely on electrophiles that are constitutively ""on"" or triggered by UV light, often resulting in high background reactivity. We developed an alternative, chemically triggered approach to crosslink RNAs using bioorthogonal cyclopropenones (CpOs). These reagents selectively react with phosphines to provide ketenes--electrophiles that can trap neighboring nucleophiles to forge covalent crosslinks. As proof-of-concept, we synthesized a panel of CpOs and appended them to thiazole orange (TO-1). The TO-1 conjugates bound selectively to a model RNA aptamer (Mango) with nanomolar affinity, confirmed by fluorescence turn-on. After phosphine administration, covalent crosslinks were formed between the CpO probes and RNA. The degree of crosslinking was both time and dose-dependent.

Maternal urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy increases risk for preterm birth; however, biological processes mediating UTI-associated preterm birth are not well-described. We established a murine maternal UTI model in which challenge with uropathogenic E. coli resulted in preterm birth in about half of dams. Dams experiencing preterm birth displayed excessive bladder inflammation and altered uteroplacental T cell polarization compared to non-laboring infected dams, with no differences in bacterial burdens. Additional factors associated with preterm birth included higher proportions of male fetuses and lower maternal serum IL-10. Furthermore, exogenous maternal IL-10 treatment absolved UTI-associated preterm birth but contributed to fetal growth restriction in this model. Using urine samples from a cohort of human pregnancies with or without UTI, we correlated urinary cytokines with birth outcomes and urine culture status.

Our unique bimodal murine model coupled with patient samples provides a platform to investigate immunological and microbial factors governing UTI-associated preterm birth, revealing novel therapeutic opportunities to predict or prevent preterm birth.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

The advantage of GD is that it is effective at learning difficult tasks. However, it produces ANNs that are a poor phenomenological fit to biology, making them less relevant as models of the brain. Specifically, it violates Dale's law, by allowing synapses to change from excitatory to inhibitory and leads to synaptic weights that are not log-normally distributed, contradicting experimental data. Here, starting from first principles of optimisation theory, we present an alternative learning algorithm, exponentiated gradient (EG), that respects Dale's Law and produces log-normal weights, without losing the power of learning with gradients. We also show that in biologically relevant settings EG outperforms GD, including learning from sparsely relevant signals and dealing with synaptic pruning. Altogether, our results show that EG is a superior learning algorithm for modelling the brain with ANNs.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

However, the extent to which these relationships develop across all 4 cardiac chambers, particularly during early-stage disease, remains unknown. Here, we discovered that very young D2.mdx mice exhibit fibrosis exclusively in the right ventricle (RV) and left atrium. Concurrent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and disorganization in the RV were related to a highly specific inflammatory signature of increased infiltrating pro-inflammatory macrophages (CD11b+CD45+CD64+F4/80+CCR2+), myofibre mitochondrial-linked apoptosis, and reduced carbohydrate and fat oxidation. This relationship did not occur in the left ventricle. Short-term daily administration of a peptidomimetic adiponectin receptor agonist, ALY688, completely prevented RV fibrosis, myofibre hypertrophy, infiltrating macrophages and mitochondrial stress as well as left atrial fibrosis. Our discoveries demonstrate early-stage cardiac tissue pathology occurs in a chamber-specific manner and is prevented by adiponectin receptor agonism, thereby opening a new direction for developing therapies that prevent tissue remodeling during DMD.

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of RyR1 bound to dantrolene and the MH trigger agent 4-chloro-m-cresol (4CmC), revealing the dantrolene and 4CmC binding sites in atomic detail. Dantrolene binds stacked with ATP or ADP in the RY12 domain at the corner of the receptor, inducing a conformational change in this domain which is allosterically coupled to pore closure. Functional analyses revealed that ATP or ADP was required for dantrolene inhibition, and a single point mutation that disrupts the peripheral ATP binding site abolished ATP/ADP-dependent dantrolene inhibition. Strikingly, in the absence of dantrolene, this site selectively binds two ADP molecules, suggesting a possible role in ATP/ADP ratio sensing.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Tau pathology spreads cell-to-cell2 but the exact mechanisms of tau release and intercellular transmission remain poorly defined. Tau is released from neurons as free protein or in extracellular vesicles (EVs)3-5 but the role of these different release mechanisms in intercellular tau transmission is unclear. Here, we show that the neuronal gene Arc is critical for packaging tau into EVs. Brain EVs purified from human tau (hTau) transgenic rTg4510 mice (rTgWT) contain high levels of hTau that are capable of seeding tau pathology. In contrast, EVs purified from rTgWT crossed with Arc knock-out mice (rTgArc KO) have significantly less hTau and cannot seed tau aggregation. Arc facilitates the release of hTau in EVs produced via the I-BAR protein IRSp53, but not free tau. Arc protein directly binds hTau to form a fuzzy complex that we identified in both mouse and human brain tissue. We find that pathological intracellular hTau accumulates in neurons in rTgArc KO mice, which correlates with accelerated neuron loss in the hippocampus. Finally, we find that intercellular tau transmission is significantly abrogated in Arc KO mice. We conclude that Arc-dependent release of tau in EVs plays a significant role in intracellular tau elimination and intercellular tau transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Of all cortical layers, layer 6b (L6b) is by far the least-studied, despite exhibiting direct sensitivity to orexin and having widespread connectivity, suggesting an important role in regulating cortical oscillations and brain state. We performed chronic electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in mice in which a subset of L6b neurons was conditionally silenced, during undisturbed conditions, after sleep deprivation (SD), and after intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin. While the total amount of waking and sleep or the response to SD were not altered, L6b-'silenced' mice showed a slowing of theta-frequency (6-9 Hz) during wake and REM sleep, and a marked reduction of total EEG power, especially in NREM sleep. The infusion of orexin A increased wakefulness in both genotypes, but the effect was more pronounced in L6b-silenced mice, while the increase in theta-activity by orexin B was attenuated in L6b silenced animals. In summary, we show the role of cortical L6b in state-dependent brain oscillations and global vigilance state control, which could be mediated by orexinergic neurotransmission. Our findings provide new insights in the understanding of abnormal regulation of arousal states in neurodevelopmental and anxiety disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

A Virtual Brain Twin (VBT) is a personalized digital replica of an individuals brain, integrating structural and functional brain data into advanced computational models and inference algorithms. By bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms, whole-brain dynamics, and imaging data, VBTs enhance the understanding of (patho)physiological mechanisms, advancing insights into both healthy and disordered brain function. Central to VBT is the network modeling that couples mesoscopic representation of neuronal activity through white matter connectivity, enabling the simulation of brain dynamics at a network level. This transformative approach provides interpretable predictive capabilities, supporting clinicians in personalizing treatments and optimizing interventions. This manuscript outlines the key components of VBT development, covering the conceptual, mathematical, technical, and clinical aspects. We describe the stages of VBT construction-from anatomical coupling and modeling to simulation and Bayesian inference-and demonstrate their applications in resting-state, healthy aging, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to other neurological disorders, such as Parkinsons disease, and explore future applications in consciousness research and brain-computer interfaces, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and brain-machine integration.

Here I argue that how the basal ganglia do what they do is a less-asked but equally important question. I show that the output regions of the basal ganglia create a stringent computational bottleneck, both structurally, because they have far fewer neurons than do their target regions, and dynamically, because of their tonic, inhibitory output. My proposed solution to this bottleneck is that the activity of an output neuron is setting the weight of a basis function, a function defined by that neurons synaptic contacts. I illustrate how this may work in practice, allowing basal ganglia output to shift cortical dynamics and control eye movements via the superior colliculus. This solution can account for troubling issues in our understanding of the basal ganglia: why we see output neurons increasing their activity during behaviour, rather than only decreasing as predicted by theories based on disinhibition, and why the output of the basal ganglia seems to have so many codes squashed into such a tiny region of the brain.

Significance statementThe basal ganglia are implicated in an extraordinary range of functions, from action selection to timing, and dysfunctions, from Parkinsons disease to obsessive compulsive disorder. Yet however the basal ganglia cause these functions and dysfunctions they must do so through a group of neurons that are dwarfed in number by both their inputs and their output targets. Here I lay out this bottleneck problem for basal ganglia computation, and propose a solution to how their outputs can control their many targets. That solution rethinks the output connections of the basal ganglia as a set of basis functions. In doing so, it provides explanations for previously troubling data on basal ganglia output, and strong predictions for how that output controls its targets.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

The popularity of this technique stems from its simplicity. Patch-clamp recording is used to observe spontaneous transmission occurring at synapses throughout a neurons dendritic tree. These events are analysed in an attempt to determine quantal synaptic parameters and changes during experimental manipulation. For decades, changes in the amplitude or frequency of mPSCs have been interpreted as evidence for specific synaptic modifications, including changes in presynaptic release sites, postsynaptic receptor abundance or even nanoscale changes in the alignment of synaptic machinery. However, at the majority of brain synapses, these events are small, with many undetectable due to recording noise. Here, using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that interpreting synaptic changes from mPSC datasets is fundamentally fallible. Due to incomplete detection of event distributions, seemingly specific changes in mPSC amplitude or frequency falsely report actual synaptic changes. In addition, probabilistic detection of small events gives false confidence in the completeness of detection and inaccurate determination of quantal size. We not only demonstrate the dense pitfalls of mini analysis, but also establish a method for experimental detection of the detection limit, allowing more robust data analysis and scientific interpretation.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Molecular analyses demonstrated that the WRAD core interacts with the replisome complex, with disruption of DPY30 resulting in DNA re-replication, DNA damage, and chromosomal instability (CIN) without affecting cancer cell proliferation. Consequently, in immunocompetent models, DPY30 loss induced T cell infiltration and immune-mediated clearance of highly proliferating cancer cells with complex karyotypes, thus improving anti-tumor efficacy upon anti-PD-1 treatment. In PDAC patients, DPY30 expression was associated with high tumor grade, worse prognosis, and limited response to immune checkpoint blockade. Together, our findings indicate that the WRAD core sustains genome stability and suggest that low intratumor DPY30 levels may identify PDAC patients who will benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

However, the role of glial mitochondria in proper brain development is not well understood. We show that astrocyte mitochondria undergo extensive fission while populating astrocyte distal branches during postnatal cortical development. Loss of mitochondrial fission regulator, Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), decreases mitochondrial localization to distal astrocyte processes, and this mitochondrial mislocalization reduces astrocyte morphological complexity. Functionally, astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of Drp1 induces astrocyte reactivity and disrupts astrocyte organization in the cortex. These morphological and organizational deficits are accompanied by loss of astrocytic gap junction protein Connexin 43. These findings uncover a crucial role for mitochondrial fission in coordinating astrocytic morphogenesis and organization, revealing the regulation of astrocytic mitochondria dynamics as a critical step in neurodevelopment.

SummaryDuring cortical astrocyte morphogenesis, mitochondria decrease in size to populate distal astrocyte processes. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is necessary for peripheral astrocyte process formation. Astrocyte-specific Drp1 loss induces astrocyte reactivity, disrupts cortical astrocyte organization, and dysregulates gap-junction protein Connexin 43 abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Recombinant CD52 has been shown to act as a broad anti-inflammatory agent, dampening both adaptive and innate immune responses. This short glycopeptide is heavily glycosylated, with a complex sialylated N-linked glycan at N3 and reported O- linked glycosylation possible on several serine and threonine residues. Previously we demonstrated that specific glycosylation features of CD52 are essential for its immunosuppressive function, with terminal -2,3-linked sialic acids required for binding to the inhibitory SIGLEC-10 receptor leading to T-cell suppression. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we have further characterised the N- and O-linked glycosylation of Expi293 recombinantly produced CD52 at a glycopeptide and released glycan level, accurately determining glycan heterogeneity of both N- and O-linked glycosylation, and localising the site of O-glycosylation to T8 with high confidence and direct spectral evidence. This detailed knowledge of CD52 glycosylation informed the construction of a model system, which we analysed by molecular dynamics simulations to understand the mechanism of recognition and define interactions between bioactive CD52, HMGB1 and the SIGLEC-10 receptor. Our results confirm the essential role of glycosylation, more specifically hyper-sialylation, in the function of CD52, and identify at the atomistic level specific interactions between CD52 glycans and the Box B domain of HMGB1 that determine recognition, and the stability of the CD52/HMGB1 complex. These insights will inform the development of synthetic CD52 as an immunotherapeutic agent.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Lesion expansion contributes to progression and increased disability, while remyelination can recover neurological deficits. However, mechanisms driving lesion dynamics are largely unclear, hindering the development of effective therapeutics. We propose that distinct states of microglia are involved in lesion expansion and remyelination 2,3. Using Stereo-seq, an RNA capture based high-resolution spatial transcriptomics technology with single-cell resolution, on post-mortem human brain tissue, we compared mixed active/inactive lesions with lipid-laden foamy microglia with lesions containing ramified microglia. We identified distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying lesion activity and remyelination, linked to microglia phenotypes and states. Lesions with foamy microglia were characterized by elevated immune activation, increased lymphocyte densities, upregulated immunoglobulin production (IGHG1, IGHG3), increased complement system activity, indication of iron dysregulation (FTL, FTH1), and increased demyelination. In contrast, lesions with ramified microglia exhibited gene expression profiles indicative of myelin stability (ABCA2, QKI) and neuro-axonal protection, fostering an environment conducive to repair and remyelination. Our findings highlight the role of microglial states in lesion expansion and repair in MS and offer promising avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing MS disability progression.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

Still, the mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 disease (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in both headache groups as compared to healthy controls at inclusion and after 6 months follow-up, but with no relation to cognitive symptoms. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

What is already known on this topicNew onset persistent headache occurs in a subset of individuals after COVID-19 and to some extent after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown.

What this study addsThere was high disability with only modest improvement after 6-month follow-up.

Altered plasma levels of soluble markers that potentially could reflect changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease with association to cognitive symptoms.

This review summarises reported contact- tracing data and evaluates the secondary attack rates (SAR) and factors associated with SARS- CoV-2 transmission in aircraft, to provide insight for future decision making in the context of future respiratory pandemics.

MethodsThis scoping literature review assessed studies published between December 2020 to November 2023 in Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The inclusion criteria were based on the PCC framework (P-Population, C-Concept, C-Context). The study population was restricted to passengers and crew (population) to assess transmission (concept) in an aircraft setting (context).

ResultsThirty-one studies which assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 521 domestic and international flights were included in this systematic review. The SAR reported in the studies with an identified index case ranged from 0% to 16%. Significant variation in the reporting across studies was noted. Overall, the studies reported that using face masks or respirators by passengers and crew members during flight seemed to be a possible strategy for mitigating SARS-CoV-2 transmission while sitting within close proximity to index cases ([&le;]2 seats in every direction) was associated with a higher SAR.

ConclusionsOur results are consistent with sporadic clusters happening onboard aircraft. Close proximity to COVID-19 cases within the aircraft was associated with a higher SAR. Our findings further underscore the need for a systematic approach to examining and reporting SARS-CoV-2 transmission onboard aircraft. This evidence may assist policymakers and transportation authorities in the development of emergency preparedness measures and travel guidance during the post-pandemic COVID-19 era.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

Liver damage has emerged as a notable feature, yet no systematic review or meta-analysis has comprehensively evaluated the biomarkers confirming liver injury in LC patients.

ObjectiveThe present study aims to examine blood-based biomarkers of liver damage in LC disease.

MethodsA search of PubMed, Google Scholar, SciFinder, and SCOPUS identified 61 eligible studies, including 7172 participants, with 3404 LC patients and 3768 controls.

ResultsOur analysis identified a significant increase in the liver damage index among LC patients, with a moderate effect size (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.553; confidence intervals; 95% CI: 0.305-0.760) compared to normal controls. Additionally, LC patients exhibited marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase (SMD = 0.615; 95% CI: 0.351;0.878), aspartate aminotransferase (SMD = 0.352; 95% CI: 0.068;0.637), gamma-glutamyl transferase (SMD = 0.969; 95% CI: 0.194;1.745), and lactate dehydrogenase (SMD = 0.666; 95% CI: 0.332;0.999) activities. Moreover, significant reductions were observed in total protein (SMD = -0.326; 95% CI: -0.631; -0.021) and increases in prothrombin time (SMD = 0.633; 95% CI: 0.077;1.189), ferritin (SMD = 0.437; 95% CI: 0.069;0.805), D-dimer (SMD = 0.359; 95% CI: 0.144;0.573). Further studies are needed to confirm reductions in platelet count and elevations in fibrinogen levels

ConclusionThis study suggests that LC is associated with persistent liver damage and coagulopathy, highlighting the need to incorporate liver injury into treatment strategies to reduce potential risks.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

Despite its popularity among recreational users and distinct pharmacodynamics, the neural correlates of 2C-B remain unexplored. Using 7T resting-state functional MRI in 22 healthy volunteers, we mapped out the acute effects of matched doses of 20 mg 2C-B, 15 mg psilocybin and placebo across spatiotemporal benchmarks of functional brain organisation. In a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, we evaluated the neuropharmacological and neurobehavioural correlates of an array of connectivity measures - including static (sFC) and global connectivity (gFC), dynamic connectivity variability (dFC), and spontaneous brain complexity. Compared to placebo, 2C-B and psilocybin selectively reduced intra-network sFC, while broadly increasing between-network and subcortical-cortical connectivity. Compared to psilocybin, 2C-B exhibited less pronounced reductions in between-network FC but elicited elevations in transmodal sFC. Both compounds yielded spatially divergent increases in gFC yet produced similar increases in brain complexity. Using PET density modelling, the spatial distribution of neural effects aligned with documented differences in monoaminergic transporter and serotonergic receptor binding affinity beyond 5-HT2A, highlighting the role of pharmacology in shaping functional dynamics. Lastly, we show behavioural markers of psychedelic effects are non-linearly reflected by the desynchronisation of the transmodal axis of functional brain organisation. Together, our findings highlight 2C-B as a useful new addition to the study of psychedelic neuroscience and may motivate new pharmacotherapy strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Here, we bridge this gap by linking genome to proteome in 800 meiotic progeny from an intercross between two closely related Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolates adapted to distinct niches. Modest genetic distance between the parents generated remarkable proteomic diversity that was amplified in the progeny and captured by 6,476 genotype-protein associations, over 1,600 of which we resolved to single variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged through the combined action of numerous cis- and trans-regulatory mutations, a regulatory architecture that was conserved across the species. Notably, trans-regulatory variants often arose in proteins not traditionally associated with gene regulation, such as enzymes. Moreover, the proteomic consequences of mutations predicted fitness under various stresses. Our study demonstrates that the collective action of natural genetic variants drives dramatic proteome diversification, with molecular consequences that forecast phenotypic outcomes.

Highlights- Proteome diversity arises from natural genetic variants, with divergent proteomes in closely related parents and progeny.
- Cis-regulatory elements had strong individual impacts, but coherent trans effects combined to dominate protein expression.
- Directional selection and frequent transgression suggest much of the proteome is under selective pressure.
- Many trans-regulators are enzymes or transporters, with fewer than 4% of pQTLs linking known interactors.
- Genome-to-proteome connections predicted the fitness impact of mutations under various stresses, including a strong but hidden causal variant in IRA2/NF1.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

However, there is a lack of reliable large-scale predictive frameworks to quantify how much genetic diversity has already been lost, let alone to quantitatively predict future losses under different conservation scenarios in the 21st century. Combining spatio-temporal population genetic theory with population genomic data of 18 plant and animal species, we studied the dynamics of genetic diversity after habitat area losses. We show genetic diversity reacts slowly to habitat area and population declines, but lagged losses will continue for many decades even after habitats are fully protected. To understand the magnitude of this problem, we combined our predictive method with species habitat area and population monitoring reported in the Living Planet Index, the Red List, and new GBF indicators. We then project genetic diversity loss in 13,808 species with a short-term genetic diversity loss of 13-22% and long-term loss of 42-48% with substantial deviations depending on the level of habitat fragmentation. These results highlight that protection of only current habitats is insufficient to ensure the genetic health of species and that continuous genetic monitoring alone likely underestimates long term impacts.

We applied our method to stress-test a highly effective gene drive that has evaded resistance in all laboratory-contained releases to date, known as Ag(QFS)1. We showed that previously undetected resistant alleles can arise at low frequency, and discovered novel, partially resistant alleles that can perturb drive-invasion dynamics. We then engineered next-generation gene drives that can actively remove resistant alleles by targeting several highly conserved and non-overlapping sites in the female-specific exon of the doublesex gene. Our models predict that such gene drive designs could suppress large, natural populations of the malaria mosquito in the field.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Male mosquitoes, on the other hand, are thought to rely exclusively on plant sugars for their energetic needs; indeed, this dichotomy is one of the central tenets of medical entomology. Here, we show that male Culex tarsalis and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes will readily take blood from a membrane feeder when reared under dehydration conditions with no toxic effects. Mosquitoes with impaired humidity detection do not increase their bloodfeeding rates when dehydrated compared to wild-type controls. While conventionally reared males ignore a human host, dehydrated males are attracted to and attempt to probe, with some success, although they cannot access host capillaries. However, they will take blood from a vertebrate host wound. When fed a blood meal containing West Nile virus, male mosquitoes can become infected with and orally transmit the pathogen at rates and titers equivalent to females. Finally, vertebrate DNA, likely from blood, was detected in wild-caught specimens of male Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes from Texas. These data suggest that under some circumstances male mosquitoes may be able to probe and/or ingest blood and transmit pathogens to vertebrate hosts, and that their role in maintaining pathogen transmission cycles should be re-examined.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Here, we develop an experimentally-constrained biophysical network model of neocortical circuit motifs, focusing on layers 2-3 of the primary visual cortex (V1). We investigate the role of four major cortical interneuron classes in a competitive-cooperative computational primitive and validate these circuit motifs implemented soft winner-take-all (sWTA) computation for gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a novel parameter mapping technique, we configured IBMs TrueNorth (TN) chip to implement sWTA computations, mirroring biological neural dynamics. Retrospectively, we observed a strong correspondence between the biophysical model and the TN hardware parameters, particularly in the roles of four key inhibitory neuron classes: Parvalbumin (feedforward inhibition), Somatostatin (feedback inhibition), VIP (disinhibition), and LAMP5 (gain normalization). Moreover, the sparse coupling of this sWTA motif was also able to simulate a two-state neural state machine on the TN chip, replicating working memory dynamics essential for cognitive tasks. Additionally, integrating the sWTA computation as a preprocessing layer in the Vision Transformer (ViT) enhanced its performance on the MNIST digit classification task, demonstrating improved generalization to previously unseen data and suggesting a mechanism akin to zero-shot learning. Our approach provides a framework for translating brain-inspired computations to neuromorphic hardware, with potential applications on platforms like Intels Loihi2 and IBMs Northpole.

Cryo-EM structures of brain-derived tau filaments revealed that specific structures define different diseases, triggering a quest for the development of experimental model systems that replicate the structures of disease. Here, we describe twelve phosphomimetic, serine/threonine to aspartate, mutations in tau, which we termed PAD12, that collectively induce the in vitro assembly of full-length tau into filaments with the same structure as that of paired helical filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that phosphomimetic mutations in the carboxy-terminal domain of tau may facilitate filament formation by disrupting an intramolecular interaction between two IVYK motifs. PAD12 tau can be used for both nucleation-dependent and multiple rounds of seeded assembly in vitro, as well as for the seeding of tau biosensor cells. PAD12 tau can be assembled into paired helical filaments under various shaking conditions, with the resulting filaments being stable for extended periods of time. They can be labelled with fluorophores and biotin. Tau filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with Alzheimers disease brains have been known to be made of hyperphosphorylated and abnormally phosphorylated full-length tau, but it was not known if the presence of this post-translational modification is more than a mere correlation. Our findings suggest that hyperphosphorylation of tau may be sufficient for the formation of the Alzheimer tau fold.

These cellular interactions can be considered to be representative of evolutionary steps in plastid acquisition in eukaryotes, but the underlying cellular mechanisms and dynamics are not fully understood. Here, we studied a kleptoplastidic dinoflagellate (RSD: Ross Sea Dinoflagellate), which is known to steal plastids of the microalga Phaeocystis antarctica. We tracked the morphology and activity of stolen plastids over several months by combining multimodal subcellular imaging and photophysiology. Upon integration inside a host vacuole, the volume of plastids and pyrenoids significantly increased and photosynthetic activity was boosted along with carbon fixation and transfer to the host. This may be supported by the retention of a 50-fold larger algal nucleus for [~]1 week. Once the algal nucleus was lost, there was a decrease in plastid volume and photosynthesis, but plastids were still beneficial for the host after > 2 months. Unlike other kleptoplastidic interactions, we showed that the algal mitochondrion was also stolen and retained for several months, transforming into an extensive network in close proximity with plastids. This highlights a new strategy in plankton along the continuum of plastid symbioses where both the energy-producing plastid and mitochondrion of a microalga are hijacked for several months by a host. This symbiosis that we found to be widely-distributed in polar regions suggests that plastid-mitochondrion interaction may have played a role in the evolution of plastid acquisition.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Here, we use long-read nanopore sequencing technology to develop a crossover mapping pipeline, COmapper, for high-resolution mapping of genome-wide crossovers from pooled DNA of F1 hybrid pollen and F2 recombinant seedlings derived from a cross between Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col and Ler. We validate the high accuracy of COmapper by applying nanopore long-read sequencing to pooled DNA of Arabidopsis F2 individuals with crossovers mapped by short-read sequencing. Using the COmapper, we constructed high-resolution genomic maps of crossovers using F1 hybrid pollen and F2 seedlings in wild type and crossover-elevated recq4a recq4b mutant, showing results comparable to short-read sequencing. Crossovers were enriched at gene-proximal promoters in wild type and increased but reshaped by high polymorphism density in recq4a recq4b.

Capturing this structure remains a significant scientific challenge. Using information theory, we apply Dynamical Independence (DI) to uncover the emergent dynamical structure in a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, shaped by the interplay of two key aspects of brain organisation: integration and segregation. In our study, functional integration within the biophysical neural model is modulated by a global coupling parameter, while functional segregation is influenced by adding dynamical noise, which counteracts global coupling. DI defines a dimensionally-reduced macroscopic variable (e.g., a coarse-graining) as emergent to the extent that it behaves as an independent dynamical process, distinct from the micro-level dynamics. We measure dynamical dependence (a departure from dynamical independence) for macroscopic variables across spatial scales. Our results indicate that the degree of emergence of macroscopic variables is relatively minimised at balanced points of integration and segregation and maximised at the extremes. Additionally, our method identifies to which degree the macroscopic dynamics are localised across microlevel nodes, thereby elucidating the emergent dynamical structure through the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic processes. We find that deviation from a balanced point between integration and segregation results in a less localised, more distributed emergent dynamical structure as identified by DI. This finding suggests that a balance of functional integration and segregation is associated with lower levels of emergence (higher dynamical dependence), which may be crucial for sustaining coherent, localised emergent macroscopic dynamical structures. This work also provides a complete computational implementation for the identification of emergent neural dynamics that could be applied both in silico and in vivo.

Author summaryUnderstanding how complex neural systems give rise to emergent macroscopic patterns is a central challenge in neuroscience. Emergence, where macroscopic structures appear from underlying microscopic interactions, plays a crucial role in brain function, yet identifying the specific dynamics involved remains elusive. Traditionally, methods have quantified the extent of emergence but have struggled to pinpoint the emergent dynamical structure itself. In this study, we develop and apply a method, based on a quantity called Dynamical Independence (DI), which simultaneously captures the extent of emergence and reveals the underlying dynamical structure in neurophysiological data. Using a minimal 5-node biophysical neural model, we explore how a balance between functional integration and segregation--two key organisational principles in the brain--affects emergent macroscopic dynamics. Our results show that a finely balanced system produces highly localised, coherent macroscopic structures, while extreme deviations lead to more distributed, less localised dynamics. This work provides a computational framework for identifying emergent dynamical structure in both theoretical models and potentially in empirical brain data, advancing our understanding of the brains complex organisation across higher-order scales.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range. To understand their persistence, we radio-tracked snakes daily over two active seasons, including high-frequency tracking of a subset of males. We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement. We revealed a particular preference for buildings in male snakes, while females preferred woodland. We demonstrate that the success of this ectothermic predator is likely tied to a willingness to use human features of the landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

Prior research finds contradictory results, which may be due to age differences between the studied offspring.

MethodsHere, we studied the entire Norwegian population aged 10 to 40 between 2006 and 2018 (N = 2,468,503). By linking tax registries to administrative health registries, we describe prevalence rates by age, sex, and parental income rank. Next, we used kinship-based models with extended families of twins and siblings to distinguish direct effects of parents from shared genetic and environmental risk factors.

ResultsWe show that lower parental income rank was associated with more psychiatric disorders at all ages from age 10 to 40 (r between -.06 and -.15). The kinship-based models indicated that direct effects of parental income played a large role (38%) in explaining the parent-offspring correlation among adolescents, while shared risk factors accounted for the entire parent-offspring correlation among adults.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that social causation plays a significant role during adolescence, while social selection fully explains the parent-offspring association in adulthood.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

Similar to AM symbiosis, multiple other intracellular symbiotic interactions have evolved in a variety of land plants. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis contrasts with these relationships as there is no intracellular accommodation of the symbiont inside the plant cell, but only intercellular colonization. This symbiotic relationship is common in a variety of seed plants, mostly trees and shrubs such as pines, willows and oaks.

Although it is known which plant lineages are involved in ECM symbiosis, there has been little investigation into the evolutionary origin of ECM symbiosis in these lineages. Furthermore, the genetic innovations and transcriptomic response related to this symbiosis have been studied largely in a genus or species-specific context, which hinders the study of their evolutionary origins. In this study, we reconstruct the origin of ECM in the rosid clade, showing at least 16 independent origins, resulting in the 17 known extant ECM rosid lineages. Moreover, comparative genomics of these lineages highlight genes involved in cell wall remodeling which underwent duplications in a convergent manner across ectomycorrhizal lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

However, cognitive abilities differ from one another in how they change with age: whereas executive functions, like working memory, show age-related decline, aspects of linguistic processing remain relatively preserved (Hartshorne et al., 2015). This heterogeneity of the cognitive-behavioral landscape in aging predicts differences among brain networks in whether and how they should change with age. To evaluate this prediction, we used individual-subject fMRI analyses (precision fMRI) to examine the language-selective network (Fedorenko et al., 2024) and the Multiple Demand (MD) network, which supports executive functions (Duncan et al., 2020), in older adults (n=77) relative to young controls (n=470). In line with past claims, relative to young adults, the MD network of older adults shows weaker and less spatially extensive activations during an executive function task and reduced within-network functional synchronization. However, in stark contrast to the MD network, we find remarkable preservation of the language network in older adults. Their language network responds to language as strongly and selectively as in younger adults, and is similarly lateralized and internally synchronized. In other words, the language network of older adults looks indistinguishable from that of younger adults. Our findings align with behavioral preservation of language skills in aging and suggest that some networks remain young-like, at least on standard measures of function and connectivity.

Significance StatementAll organs, including brains, change as we age. However, the brain is not a uniform structure: it comprises multiple distinct networks, each supporting a different aspect of perception, motor control, and cognition. We examine two cognitive brain networks using fMRI and--across two independent cohorts--find a clear dissociation: the so-called Multiple Demand network, which supports executive functions (e.g., working memory), shows clear age-related decline; however, the language-selective network, which supports comprehension and production, remains young-like on all measures of network function and connectivity, in line with the preservation of linguistic skills in older adults. These findings challenge the notion of generalized brain aging and highlight the importance of dissociable components in the brain and mind.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1730239811972

Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down.

However, high-fat diets are typically provided freely to animals in obesity experiments, so it remains unclear if high-fat diets would still cause obesity if they required more effort to obtain. We hypothesized that unrestricted and easy access is necessary for high-fat diet induced over-eating, and the corollary that requiring mice to perform small amounts of work to obtain high-fat diet would reduce high-fat diet intake and associated weight gain. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel home-cage based feeding device that either provided high-fat diet freely, or after mice poked their noses into a port one time - a simple action that is easy for them to do. We tested the effect of this intervention for six weeks, with mice receiving all daily calories from high-fat diet, modifying only how they accessed it. Requiring mice to nose-poke to access high-fat diet reduced intake and nearly completely prevented the development of obesity. In follow up experiments, we observed a similar phenomenon in mice responding for low-fat grain-based pellets that do not induce obesity, suggesting a general mechanism whereby animals engage with and consume more food when it is freely available vs. when it requires a simple action to obtain. We conclude that unrestricted access to food promotes overeating, and that a simple action such as a nose-poke can reduce over-eating and weight gain in mice. This may have implications for why over-eating and obesity are common in modern food environments, which are often characterized by easy access to low-cost unhealthy foods.","NA","biorxiv",1730239811972
