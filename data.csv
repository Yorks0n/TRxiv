In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN two months following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against a COVID-19 vaccine. We observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with a mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the Spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859786

In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies from immunised cattle, primarily because of their ability to produce antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) domains. Such antibodies have been shown to have potent and cross-reactive neutralisation phenotypes in other virus infections. Following extended immunisation with different forms of spike protein and using single B-cell sorting and phage display techniques, we isolated 33 mAbs, including 10 with ultra-long CDRH3s (>50 amino acids). Of these, mAbs P7 and 99 exhibited remarkable neutralisation breadth and potency. Notably, mAb P7, which possessed an ultra-long CDRH3, neutralised all tested variants, including SARS-CoV-1, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 ug/mL to 1.06 ug/mL. This antibody was also cross-reactive against a panel of RBDs from diverse sarbecovirus species. Structural studies revealed that mAb 99 targets a region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Although the structure of the P7 Fab-RBD complex was not resolvable, data suggest P7 induces trimer dissociation by binding to an occluded RBD epitope, likely mediated by the extended CDRH3 structure. Syrian hamster challenge experiments, using several VOCs, showed that mAbs P7 and 99 significantly reduced lung viral load. These findings highlight the potential of bovine-derived, especially those possessing ultra-long CDRH3s, as effective therapeutics against current and future sarbecovirus threats.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859786

This suggests that different brain areas serve distinct functions supporting complex behavior. However, a common observation is that essentially anything that an animal senses, knows, or does can be decoded from neural activity in any brain area (4-6). If everything is everywhere, why have distinct areas? Here we show that the function of a brain area is more related to how different types of information are combined (formatted) in neural representations than merely whether that information is present. We compared two brain areas: the middle temporal area (MT), which is important for visual motion perception (7, 8), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which is linked to decision-making and reward expectation (9,10)). When monkeys based decisions on a combination of motion and reward information, both types of information were present in both areas. However, they were formatted differently: in MT, they were encoded separably, while in dlPFC, they were represented jointly in ways that reflected the monkeys' decision-making. A recurrent neural network (RNN) model that mirrored the information formatting in MT and dlPFC predicted that manipulating activity in these areas would differently affect decision-making. Consistent with model predictions, electrically stimulating MT biased choices midway between the visual motion stimulus and the preferred direction of the stimulated units (11), while stimulating dlPFC produced 'winner-take-all' decisions that sometimes reflected the visual motion stimulus and sometimes reflected the preference of the stimulated units, but never in between. These results are consistent with the tantalizing possibility that a modular structure enables complex behavior by flexibly reformatting information to accomplish behavioral goals.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859786

While mu opioid receptors are central to the analgesic effects of opioid drugs, the endogenous opioid neurocircuitry underlying pain and placebo analgesia remains poorly understood. The ventrolateral column of the posterior periaqueductal gray is a critical hub for nociception and endogenous analgesia mediated by opioid signaling. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the cell-type identities, the sub-second neural dynamics involved in pain modulation, the role of endogenous peptide neuromodulators, and the contextual factors influencing these processes. Using spatial mapping with single-nuclei RNA sequencing of pain-active neurons projecting to distinct long-range brain targets, alongside cell type-specific and activity-dependent genetic tools for in vivo optical recordings and modulation of neural activity and opioid peptide release, we identified a functional dichotomy in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Neurons expressing mu opioid receptors encode active nociceptive states, whereas enkephalin-releasing neurons drive pain relief during recovery from injury, in response to learned fear predictions, and during placebo analgesia. Finally, by leveraging the functional effects of placebo analgesia, we used direct optogenetic activation of vlPAG enkephalin neurons to drive opioid peptide release, resulting in a robust reduction in pain. These findings show that diverse need states converge on a shared midbrain circuit that releases endogenous opioids with high spatiotemporal precision to suppress nociceptive activity and promote analgesia.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859786

These complex networks have been shown to be disrupted during aging, disease, and cancer. However, profiling these networks across diverse cell types and states has been limited due to the technical constraints of existing methods for mapping DNA:Protein interactions in single cells. As a result, a critical gap remains in understanding where TFs or other chromatin remodelers bind to DNA and how these interactions are perturbed in pathological contexts. To address this challenge, we developed a transformative single-cell immuno-tethering DNA:Protein mapping technology. By coupling a species-specific antibody-binding nanobody to a cytosine base editing enzyme, this approach enables profiling of even weak or transient factor binding to DNA, a task that was previously unachievable in single cells. Thus, our Docking & Deamination followed by sequencing (D&D-seq) technique induces cytosine-to-uracil edits in genomic regions bound by the target protein, offering a novel means to capture DNA:Protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. Importantly, this technique can be seamlessly incorporated into common single-cell multiomics workflows, enabling multimodal analysis of gene regulation in single cells. We tested the ability of D&D-seq to record TF binding both in bulk and at the single-cell level by profiling CTCF and GATA family members, obtaining high specificity and efficiency, with clear identification of TF footprint and signal retention in the targeted cell subpopulations. Furthermore, the deamination reaction showed minimal off-target activity, with high concordance to bulk ChIP-seq reference data. Applied to primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), D&D-seq successfully identified CTCF binding sites and enabled integration with advanced machine-learning algorithms for predicting 3D chromatin structure. Furthermore, we integrated D&D-seq with single-cell genotyping to assess the impact of IDH2 mutations on CTCF binding in a human clonal hematopoiesis sample, uncovering altered binding and chromatin co-accessibility patterns in mutant cells. Altogether, D&D-seq represents an important technological advance enabling the direct mapping of TF or chromatin remodeler binding to the DNA in primary human samples, opening new avenues for understanding chromatin and transcriptional regulation in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859786

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736114859786

The ability to orient towards sounds is a key component of social interactions, yet auditory spatial attention remains relatively understudied in ASD, despite some prior research indicating differences in this domain. Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed decreased cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed increased alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

However, it remains largely unclear how plants regulate their resistance to restrict bacterial infection in response to humidity. Here, we demonstrate that abscisic acid (ABA)-catabolizing ABA 8'-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP707A3 , plays a critical role in this resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elevated humidity induces CYP707A3 expression, which is essential for reducing ABA levels and promoting stomatal opening, thereby limiting bacterial water-soaking and infection following leaf invasion. High humidity also increases cytosolic Ca2+ levels via the Ca2+ channels CNGC2 and CNGC4, with partial involvement from CNGC9, activating the calmodulin-binding transcription activator CAMTA3 to drive CYP707A3 induction. However, Pst DC3000 counteracts this defense response using type III secretion effectors, particularly AvrPtoB, facilitating water-soaking. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the competition between plants and bacteria for leaf water under elevated humidity.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

An open question is how experience interacts with innate constraints to enable functional specialization. We investigate this question by comparing vOTC function across sighted and congenitally blind adults. In sighted adults, a region in lateral vOTC called the fusiform face area (FFA) responds preferentially to faces, whereas distinct left-lateralized portions of vOTC respond to written language. In blind people, lateral vOTC responds to face touching, braille and speech, but their functional co-localization has not been tested. The same group of congenitally blind adults (n=20) touched faces and spatial layouts (Experiment 1) and performed a reading (braille) and spoken language task (Experiment 2). Sighted adults performed analogous tasks in the visual modality (n=28). Using within subject analyses, we replicate the separation of faces and written language in sighted adults: written language responses are found only in left vOTC and within that hemisphere they are separate from faces. By contrast, left and right vOTC responds to language in people born blind and in the left hemisphere face and language responses overlap. These findings suggest that visual experience contributes to segregating responses to face and language in vOTC.

In previous studies, we found enhanced IgG reactivity to EBV EBNA4 and EBNA6 arginine-rich sequences in postinfectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS).

ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) EBNA4 and EBNA6 sequences and homologous human sequences in PCS and ME/CFS.

MethodsThe IgG responses against poly-R EBNA4 and EBNA6 and corresponding homologous human 15-mer peptides and respective full-length proteins were analyzed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex dot-blot assay. Sera of 45 PCS patients diagnosed according to WHO criteria, with 26 patients fulfilling the Canadian Consensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls (HC) were investigated.

ResultsAutoantibodies to poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-{beta} signaling regulator TSPLY2, angiogenic regulator TSPYL5, as well as to full-length -adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more frequent in patients. Several autoantibodies were positively associated with key symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognition, and pain.

ConclusionCollectively, we identified autoantibodies with new antigen specificities with a potential role in PCS and ME/CFS.

Clinical ImplicationThese finding should prompt further studies on the function of these autoantibodies, their exploitation for diagnostic use, and of drugs targeting autoantibodies.

Capsule summaryOur study reveals elevated autoantibodies to EBV-related poly-R sequences and their human homologues in PCS and ME/CFS patients associated with symptom severity, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1736114859787

Here, we demonstrate that lactate is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis in pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). The oncogenic histone H3K27M mutation upregulates phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and drives lactate production from [U-13C]-glucose in DMGs. Lactate activates the nucleoside diphosphate kinase NME1 via lactylation and promotes the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates essential for tumor proliferation. Importantly, we show that this mechanistic link between glycolysis and nucleotide biosynthesis provides a unique opportunity for deuterium metabolic imaging of DMGs. Spatially mapping 2H-lactate production from [6,6-2H]-glucose allows visualization of the metabolically active tumor lesion and provides an early readout of response to standard-of-care radiation and targeted therapy that precedes extended survival and reflects pharmacodynamic alterations at the tissue level in preclinical DMG models in vivo at clinical field strength (3T). In essence, we have identified an H3K27M-lactate-NME1 axis that promotes DMG proliferation and facilitates non-invasive metabolic imaging of DMGs.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods: We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), or interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results: Microglia-astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-/IL-1{beta} elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions: Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Highly virulent WEEV strains can also bind the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) as alternative receptors. Here, by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of WEEV strains isolated from 1941 to 2005 bound to mammalian receptors, we identify polymorphisms in the WEEV spike protein that explain shifts in receptor dependencies and that can allow nonpathogenic strains to infect primary cortical neurons. We predict the receptor dependencies of additional strains and of a related North American alphavirus.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most serious types of DNA damage, as they lead to loss of genetic information and death when not repaired. In E. coli, they are recognised and processed by the RecBCD complex, which initiates repair by homologous recombination. Although the repair dynamics downstream of RecBCD has been well characterised, it is still unclear how long this complex stays attached to DNA and what triggers its dissociation in vivo. To answer these questions, we imaged RecB at the single-molecule level, and quantified its dynamic behaviour in bacterial cells exposed to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that induces DSBs. Our results show that RecB forms long-lived complexes with DSBs (10 seconds), and that its dissociation from DNA is an intrinsic property of the complex, that does not depend on the amount of DNA damage, nor the following steps in the repair pathway. Moreover, we show that we can use RecB binding to DSBs as a marker to estimate the rate of damage formation. This study provides a detailed quantitative insight into the interaction of RecBCD with DNA double-strand ends in E. coli in vivo, and into the bacterial response to DSBs induced by ciprofloxacin.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

While the reduction of genomes in intracellular symbionts of animals, including parasitic bacteria, has been extensively studied, less is known about such bacteria associated with single-celled eukaryotes. Here, we report the genomes of two novel gammaproteobacterial lineages, RS3 and XS4, identified as putative parasitic endosymbionts of the dinoflagellate Citharistes regius. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that RS3 and XS4 belong to the family Fastidiosibacteraceae within the order Beggiatoales, forming independent lineages therein. The genomes of RS3 and XS4 are 529 Kbp and 436 Kbp in size, respectively, revealing drastic genome reduction compared to related bacterial genomes. XS4, which has a particularly reduced genome with low GC content, uses an alternative genetic code, in which UGA assigned tryptophan. The small genomes of RS3 and XS4 encode a limited number of proteins, retaining only approximately 20% of the predicted ancestral proteome. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that RS3 and XS4 are energy parasites, heavily dependent on their host for essential metabolites. Furthermore, we found that the ancestor of both genomes likely acquired an ADP:ATP antiporter gene via horizontal gene transfer, an event that may have enabled their evolution as energy parasites by facilitating the acquisition of ATP from their host. These observations on novel bacteria with highly reduced genomes expand our understanding of the phylogenetic and genomic diversity of endosymbiotic bacteria in protists.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Understanding the individual and collective mechanical contributions of these three different cytoskeletal elements is essential to elucidate how cells maintain mechanical integrity during deformation. Here we use a custom single-cell rheometer to identify the distinct contributions of actin and vimentin to the viscoelastic and nonlinear elastic response of cells to uniaxial compression. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild type (WT) and vimentin knockout (vim -/-) mice in combination with chemical treatments to manipulate actin polymerization and contractility. We show through small amplitude oscillatory measurements and strain ramp tests that vimentin, often overlooked in cellular mechanics, plays a role comparable to actin in maintaining cell stiffness and resisting large compressive forces. However, actin appears to be more important than vimentin in determining cellular energy dissipation. Finally we show by comparing wild type and enucleated cells that compression stiffening originates from the actin and vimentin cytoskeleton, while the nucleus appears to play little role in this. Our findings provide insight into how cytoskeletal networks collectively determine the mechanical properties of cells, providing a basis to understand the role of the cytoskeleton in the ability of cells to resist external as well as internal forces.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

We present data on the validation of eight peptide barcodes, each designed to minimize detection bias and maximize sensitivity across various experimental conditions. We have also optimized the design of expression constructs to ensure robustness of the purification workflow. In this workflow, affinity-tagged proteins are expressed with unique peptide barcodes. Following experimental selection or treatments, the proteins are purified, and the peptide barcodes are cleaved and sequenced on the Platinum instrument. We demonstrate that we can detect barcodes at 400 fmol of sample input concentration within the eight-plex mixture, and at 50 fmol of sample input for individual barcodes. We also show the capacity of this protein barcoding approach to achieve a ten-fold dynamic range, underscoring its sensitivity in recovering variants with low abundance. Through the combination of protein barcoding and NGPS, we lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at characterizing protein interactions and improving targeted drug delivery strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Targeting joint inflammation with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has not resulted in the anticipated reduction in pain for many patients. This can partly be explained by the concept of central sensitisation whereby spinal and supraspinal pathways have a lower threshold of activation leading to increased perception of pain. Synovial stromal cells such as fibroblasts are also thought to play a role through peripheral sensitisation of nerves in the joint. Synovial fibroblasts are known to produce pro-algesic mediators such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nerve growth factor (NGF) at the mRNA level. These pro-algesic mediators could activate sensory nerve fibres that send signals from the joint to the spinal cord, thereby driving persistent pain in RA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate which pro-algesic mediators are produced by lining versus sublining fibroblasts and whether the level of these mediators correlates with clinical measures of pain in patients with RA. Methods and analysis FiND-Pain RA is a multi-centre observational study which will recruit 50 patients with seropositive RA who attend the rheumatology department of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Clinical examination, pain-focused patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), ultrasound examination and ultrasound guided synovial biopsy of the knee will be performed. The levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators will be measured in fibroblasts from the lining and sublining layer of the synovium. The location and spatial morphology of sensory nerve fibres and their proximity to lining and sub-lining fibroblasts will be characterized. The primary outcome will be to determine whether the knee pain scores of participants correlate with the level of LIF, a novel putative pain-mediator expressed in sub-lining fibroblasts. The secondary outcomes will be to determine whether other pro-algesic mediators produced by lining or sub-lining fibroblasts correlate with clinical measures of pain and to assess the location and proximity of sensory nerve fibres to lining versus sub-lining fibroblasts.","NA","medrxiv",1736114859787

These PTPs bind overlapping sets of ITIM/ITSM-bearing proteins, suggesting that they might have some redundant functions. By studying T cell-specific single and double knockout mice, we found that SHP1 and SHP2 redundantly restrain naive T cell differentiation to effector and central memory phenotypes, with SHP1 playing the dominant role. Surprisingly, loss of SHP2 alone in T cells enhanced the antitumor effects of anti-PD-1 antibodies, whereas there was no effect of SHP1 deletion. Also unexpectedly, the absence of both PTPs resulted in poorer tumor control and failure to respond to PD-1 blockade, associated with reduced frequency and activation of T cells and dendritic cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD4+, but not CD8+ T cells lacking SHP1 and SHP2 show increased activation-induced cell death upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells restored normal levels of tumor control in mice lacking both PTPs. Together, our results demonstrate that SHP1 or SHP2 is required to prevent activation-induced cell death of CD4+ T cells and is critical for tumor immunity, raising the possibility that inhibition of SHP2 might augment the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1-based immune therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Results showed that Vibrio atlanticus was able to coordinate lightning group attacks then kill the dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum ACT03. Briefly, the observed coordinated mechanism of algal-killing consists of first, the immobilization stage involving the secretion of algicidal metabolites that disrupt the flagella of the prey. The attack stage resembles the wolf-pack attack strategy, during which Vibrios surrounds algal cells at high density for a brief period without invading them. Finally, the killing stage induces the lysis and degradation of the dinoflagellates. By using a combination of biochemical, proteomic, genetic and fluorescence microscopy approaches, we showed that this relationship is not related to the decomposition of algal organic matter, Vibrio quorum sensing pathways, to the toxicity of the algae or to the pathogenicity of the bacterium but is conditioned by nutrient stress, iron availability and link to the iron-vibrioferrin transport system of V. atlanticus.

However, whether this entrainment extends to subcortical structures and shapes human behavior remains unclear. In a first experiment, we used intracranial EEG recordings in epileptic patients during a visual search task. While neutral stimulation induced moderate entrainment, we demonstrated that 5 Hz negative-valence stimulation can significantly entrain theta oscillations in a widespread task-related cortico-subcortical network, with increased synchrony in the ventral visual stream, the hippocampus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In a second behavioral experiment in healthy individuals, visual search performance improved under both stimulation conditions, but memory for target images, assessed through an additional recognition task, was significantly enhanced after negative stimulation.

Early symptoms include behavioral changes such as anorexia (loss of appetite) that precede weight loss and organ wasting. Around ~50-80% of patients with advanced cancer develop CC generating a pressing need to understand CC progression. Although recent advances have identified distinct metabolic, inflammatory, and neuronal networks associated with CC, the underlying mechanisms initiating early-stage CC remain unclear. This outstanding question has proven difficult to answer in murine models due to the complexity and onset variability of CC. To address this, we utilized a fly colorectal-tumor model with a defined time-window for organ wasting. We discovered that combined increase of conserved factors involved in inflammation (Upd3/Interleukin-6-like) and in reduced insulin signaling (ImpL2/Insulin Growth Factor Binding Protein) cause orexigenic dysfunction prior to organ wasting due to silencing of NPF (Neuropeptide F/ Neuropeptide Y) signaling in the brain.

However, their development remains a considerable challenge. Here, we introduce a therapeutic ""living glue"" for the automatic detection and on-demand treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This living glue employs a genetically engineered, non-pathogenic Escherichia coli with a highly sensitive blood-inducible gene circuit to monitor gastrointestinal bleeding, a key indicator of severe IBD. Upon detection, the bacteria respond by producing potent adhesive and therapeutic proteins at bleeding sites, enabling robust attachment to inflamed tissues and sustained treatment. In a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse model, a single rectal administration of the living glue markedly improved weight recovery, reversed colonic shortening, and reduced intestinal bleeding. Additionally, the living glue decreased intestinal inflammation, promoted mucosal repair, and restored gut barrier integrity, demonstrating comprehensive therapeutic effects in alleviating IBD symptoms. This study highlights the potential of integrating programmable, living components into biomaterials for autonomous, targeted, and enhanced medical interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet of the OM is crucial for barrier function. After its synthesis in the cytoplasm and translocation to the periplasm, LPS is transported to the OM by the LPS transport system. The LPS translocon, composed of an OM protein LptD and a lipoprotein LptE, mediates LPS assembly into the OM. Recently, the small lipoprotein LptM (YifL) was identified as a novel LptD/E-interactor that facilitates LptD maturation. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigated the detailed interaction between LptM and LptD. We found that LptM interacts with the folded LptD intermediate at the late stage of its maturation. Mutational analyses demonstrated that the N-terminal conserved region (C20GLKGPLYF28) of LptM is essential for its function. Cryo-EM structural analysis of the E. coli LptD/E/M complex, combined with biochemical analyses, revealed the molecular basis of the LptM-LptD interaction and its functional importance. Thus, we propose that LptM functions as a ""barrel-rivet,"" stabilizing LptD for its proper assembly.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

However, it is not clear why non-canonical IAV RNAs activate RIG-I in a sequence- and RNA structure-dependent manner. Insight into this process is critical for understanding the exact molecular steps through which an influenza virus infection activates innate immune signaling and why differences exist in infection outcome. Here we investigated whether non-canonical or aberrant transcription of mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), a <125 nt long RNA whose expression is increased in pandemic and highly pathogenic IAV infections, contributes to RIG-I activation. We find that mvRNAs can cause non-canonical transcription termination through a truncated 5' polyadenylation signal or a 5' transient RNA structure that interrupts polyadenylation. The resulting capped complementary RNAs (ccRNA) can trigger the release of a template mvRNA and activate RIG-I when they form a heteroduplex with a negative sense RNA. Overall, our findings indicate that sequential rounds of non-canonical or aberrant viral replication and transcription explain the sequence-dependent efficiency with which mvRNAs trigger innate immune signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

HSC requires a specialized bone marrow microenvironment, known as the niche, for proper differentiation and self-renewal. While several molecular and cellular elements of the niche are described, the precise understanding of the mechanobiology underlying HSC adhesion to the niche remains poorly understood. Here, we aim to characterize physical interactions and adhesion within the hematopoietic niche by combining cell sorting, surface functionalization, and atomic force microscopy. Using this approach, we quantified and compared the adhesion of bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to different extracellular proteins, as well as the adhesion of HSCs to MSCs. We observed that MSCs adhere with the greatest force to fibronectin in an Arg-Gly-As (RGD) motif mediated and actin cytoskeleton-dependent manner. Additionally, we showed that HSCs strongly adhere to MSC within 30 seconds and that the binding is RGD-independent. In conclusion, we demonstrated how to implement atomic force microscopy to measure the physiological interactions within the HSCs niche in a direct, specific, and quantitative way. This approach provides a more comprehensive and precise characterization of the biology of the HSC niche compared to previously used methods. Furthermore, it highlights the complexity of studying extremely small structures and rare cell populations in biophysical experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

In mice and humans, we found that growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (the most prominent respiratory pathogen in a retrospective cohort of patients with ARDS) is enhanced by increased alveolar concentrations of multiple ALI/ARDS-associated metabolites, which are derived from the blood and cross the compromised alveolar-capillary barrier during alveolar leak. Collectively, this work reveals an ecological mechanism by which pathogens may survive in the injured lung microenvironment and identifies new potential targets for secondary pneumonia prevention and treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

In this study, we successfully generated a range of chloroplast-genome-edited Arabidopsis thaliana plants targeting rbcL by a targeted base editor, ptpTALECD. The M309I and D397N substitutions in rbcL resulted in an increased Rubisco catalytic rate (kcat) without any reductions of Rubisco content, thereby enhancing photosynthetic rates and plant growth under both current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (i.e., 381 mol mol-1) and projected future concentrations (i.e., 549 mol mol-1). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis showed that the M309I and D397N substitutions, although located far from the catalytic site, induce structural alterations in the catalytic (60s) loops.

In plants, centromeres are loaded with CENH3-variant nucleosomes, which direct kinetochore formation and spindle microtubule interaction. Plant centromeres are frequently composed of megabase-scale satellite repeat arrays, or retrotransposon nests. In monocentric genomes, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, extended regions of pericentromeric heterochromatin surround the CENH3-occupied satellite arrays. A zone of suppressed meiotic crossover recombination contains the centromere and extends into the pericentromeres. Here, we explore how Arabidopsis natural genetic variation influences centromere-proximal crossover frequency, and segregation distortion through meiosis, when homologous centromeres are structurally heterozygous. Results: We used fluorescent crossover reporters to survey the effect of natural variation on centromere-proximal recombination in twelve F1 hybrids, capturing Arabidopsis Eurasian and relict diversity. The majority of F1 hybrids showed either elevated or suppressed centromere-proximal crossovers (49 of 60), relative to inbreds. We relate hybrid crossover frequencies to patterns of centromeric structural variation, and in a subset of accessions, to epigenetic patterns of CENH3 loading and DNA methylation. The fluorescent reporters also allow segregation distortion through meiosis to be compared between inbred and hybrid strains. We observed a minority of hybrids (18 of 60) with distorted segregation through meiosis compared to inbreds, with and without simultaneous change to centromere-proximal crossover frequency. Conclusions: We reveal a complex relationship between centromere structural variation, epigenetic state, crossover recombination, and segregation distortion. We propose a model for how Arabidopsis centromere structural heterozygosity may cause segregation distortion during female meiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

For successful integration of pest management, especially for early diagnostics of new aggressive or fungicide-resistant lineages, it is critical to understand population diversity in the field. We look at whole-genome sequence data for three datasets to differentiate within field diversity in fields of similar size: one dataset from a newly sampled field population from the United Kingdom and two publicly available datasets from fields from the United States and Switzerland. Inspection of population structure and diversity features, such as minor allele frequency distribution and clonality, show no within-field structure, the most abundant SNPs are present in low frequency, and European fields have higher clonality. Knowing that effectors play particularly important roles in (a)virulence, we specifically assess effector diversity characteristics. Whereas on a whole-genome scale, we can see separation of the populations at the regional scale, we do not find such separation for the effectors. Moreover, we find that multiple effector haplotypes can be found interspersed within the field and even occur within what has been considered clonal isolates or isolates from a single lesion. Our analyses highlight that within-field Z. tritici diversity is higher than previously reported.

In the early branching protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, microtubule-severing enzymes are involved in cytokinesis and flagellum length control during different life cycle stages, but none of them have been found to regulate mitosis in any life cycle form. Here, we report the biochemical and functional characterization of the microtubule-severing enzyme spastin in the procyclic form of T. brucei. We demonstrate that spastin catalyzes microtubule severing in vitro and ectopic overexpression of spastin disrupts spindle microtubules in vivo in trypanosome cells, leading to defective chromosome segregation. Knockdown of spastin impairs spindle integrity and disrupts chromosome alignment in metaphase and chromosome segregation in anaphase. We further show that the function of spastin requires the catalytic AAA-ATPase domain, the microtubule-binding domain, and the microtubule interacting and trafficking domain, and that the association of spastin with spindle depends on the microtubule-binding domain. Together, these results uncover an essential role for spastin in chromosome segregation by regulating spindle dynamics in this unicellular eukaryote.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

It is unknown, however, whether inhibition during selective retrieval specifically targets a competitor's episodic representation or instead extends to its affective components. Here we report evidence in humans that selective retrieval of a neutral memory not only diminishes access to the mnemonic content of unpleasant competing memories, but also alters their emotional character. Memory and emotion suppression effects were accompanied by reduced neural activation and weakened representational patterns unique to competing memories in the VTC and amygdala respectively, in an independent fashion. Selective retrieval engaged the left VLPFC, which decreased in activity over repeated retrievals of the same memory, as competition from the unpleasant scene was resolved. This left VLPFC region colocalizes with key prefrontal regions engaged during cognitive reappraisal, suggesting that selective retrieval's impact on affective responses may contribute to reappraisal's benefits. These findings indicate that inhibitory control during selective retrieval affects both mnemonic and affective representations, providing a novel mechanistic basis for a well-known emotion regulation practice.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

A second, evolutionarily recent primate-specific lncRNA XACT was proposed to antagonize XIST's ability to induce XCI. XACT expression is restricted to pluripotent states and early embryonic stages and coats the active X-chromosome in both females and males. Here, we report a novel XACT transcript expressed in normal and cancerous somatic cells from both the inactive (Xi) and active (Xa) X chromosomes. It coexists with XIST on the Xi without affecting XIST expression or (re)activating X-linked genes inactivated by XCI. During hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation, XACT is primarily expressed in myeloid progenitors in both sexes. XACT expression is activated in HSCs and peaks in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells (MEPs) before rapidly declining as the MEPs differentiate into megakaryocytes or erythrocytes. By combining CRISPR-based XACT perturbation with epigenomic and transcriptional studies, we revealed the key role of XACT in the self-renewal and differentiation of erythroid progenitors into erythrocytes, by recruiting cis-regulatory proteins and regulating transcription through ETS and AP-1 transcription factors. Furthermore, XACT is expressed in a subset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, with high levels found in erythroid-megakaryocytic blast cells; suggesting XACT's potential as a marker for AML subtypes. Thus, we identified a novel XACT transcript with a unique expression profile and important roles in normal and cancer cells, revealing XACT lncRNA functions beyond its previously proposed role in XCI during embryogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Materials & methodsPaired pupillary light reflex curves were recorded from 25 healthy volunteers using the MindMirror mobile telephone application, and a Neuroptics NPi 200 clinical pupillometer. The curves were analysed for correlation using a Pearson correlation coefficient across both curve sets.

ResultsClose correlation was demonstrated between all parameters except maximum and mean pupillary constriction velocity. These values were consistently lower in the MindMirror derived curves and may be explained by the intensity of the light stimulus available from a mobile telephone being significantly less that that used by the clinical pupillometer.

ConclusionA mobile telephone equipped with a MindMirror mobile phone application may provide a reliable, low cost and widely available alternative to a clinical pupillometer in the assessment of the pupillary light reflex.

Plain language summaryClinical pupillometry allows objective measurement of Pupillary Light Reflex (PLR) parameters, giving reproducible measurements shown to be independent predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with various neurological insults, and is increasingly being used as a clinical assessment tool among ambulatory patients outside of the hospital setting, particularly for concussion assessment in sports medicine. The MindMirror smartphone application uses artificial intelligence to identify and measure changes in important PLR components, and was shown to deliver variables with high levels of correlation and agreement with existing measurement tools such as the Neuroptics NPi-200TM Automated Pupillometer.

A commonality across the most prevalent ataxias is the underlying disease mechanism secondary to expansions of short tandem DNA repeats. There is currently an incomplete understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these repeat expansion disorders, a core feature of which revolves around RNA-dysregulation. In this study, we used both bulk and single nuclear RNA-sequencing to study post-mortem brain tissue of human donors with a range of repeat-expansion ataxias to reveal further mechanistic insights. We compared post-mortem paired cerebellar and frontal cortex tissue bulk RNA-sequencing data from 23 ataxia patients and 22 sex-, age-matched controls from two brain banks (spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)1, SCA2, SCA6, SCA7, SCA17, Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), and 7 cases with unknown molecular diagnoses). We analysed bulk RNA-sequencing data for transcript usage, differential and cell-type-specific expression to transcriptomically profile these diseases. We also generated single nuclear RNA-sequencing data of the cerebellum from donors with SCA1, SCA2, SCA6 and FRDA to decipher changes in cell type proportions in the disease state. Using this approach, we found that: (i) despite the commonalities in the genetics of ataxia, there were components of their transcriptional signatures which were distinct; (ii) there were extensive transcriptional changes evident not only in the cerebellum but also the frontal cortex in ataxia cases; (iii) activation of immune and inflammatory pathways, as well as involvement of non-neuronal cell types was a feature of all ataxias to a lesser or greater extent. This study provides a novel resource to understand the mechanisms of disease in ataxia. Furthermore, taken together, these results highlight immune pathways and the role of non-neuronal cell types as early and potentially important therapeutic targets. These findings provide a map of transcriptomic changes in ataxia to further understanding of the underlying pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Extraintestinal Escherichia coli (ExPEC), known to be the most common instigators of urinary tract infections (UTIs), represent such global threat. Novel strategies for more efficient treatments are therefore desperately needed. These include silver nanoparticles, which have been used as antimicrobial surface-coatings on catheters to eliminate biofilm-forming uropathogens and reduce the risk of nosocomial infections. AGXX(R) is a promising silver coating that presumably kills bacteria through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) but is more potent than silver. However, neither is AGXX(R)'s mode of action fully understood, nor have its effects on Gram-negative bacteria or bacterial response and defense mechanisms towards AGXX(R) been studied in detail. Here, we report that the bactericidal effects of AGXX(R) are primarily based on ROS formation, as supplementation of the media with a ROS scavenger completely abolished AGXX(R)-induced killing. We further show that AGXX(R) impairs the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope and causes substantial protein aggregation and DNA damage already at sublethal concentrations. ExPEC strains appear to be more resistant to the proteotoxic effects of AGXX(R) compared to non-pathogenic E. coli, indicating improved defense capabilities of the uropathogen. Global transcriptomic studies of AGXX(R)-stressed ExPEC revealed a strong oxidative stress response, perturbations in metal homeostasis, as well as the activation of heat shock and DNA damage responses. Finally, we present evidence that ExPEC counter AGXX(R) damage through the production of the chaperone polyphosphate.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Various sample concentrating methods, such as centrifugal ultrafiltration, have been utilized in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection studies. However, freeze drying, a promising technique commonly used for concentrating and preserving various biological samples, has yet to be explored in this field. This study compared the performance of freeze-drying and the widely used centrifugal ultrafiltration method in terms of recovery rate, detection limit, and other key parameters for concentrating 72 wastewater samples collected from four facilities in El Paso, TX. Statistical analyses revealed that the freeze-drying method demonstrated higher overall recovery efficiency (20.33% vs 13.00%), a superior detection ratio (68.4% vs. 31.6%), and lower detection limits (0.06copies/mL vs 0.35copis/mL) than centrifugal ultrafiltration, particularly during the early stages of the pandemic. Despite its longer processing time than centrifugal ultrafiltration, freeze-drying offers several notable advantages, including eliminating pretreatment steps, providing flexible sample storage options, preventing signal loss and sample degradation, and reducing labor and exposure risks. Freeze-drying also does not require intensive training for concentrating sewage water. These benefits, combined with its efficient capture of viral RNA, position freeze-drying as a promising alternative for wastewater virus detection, especially in resource-constrained lab settings at local wastewater treatment plants. The protocol and findings reported here provide a baseline for further development of freeze-drying-based methods for enabling community-level early warning and surveillance against emerging viral threats in the future.","NA","medrxiv",1736114859787

A great majority of their manifold copies remain silenced in somatic cells, nevertheless, some are transcribed, often in a tissue specific manner, and a small fraction retains its ability to mobilize. Retrotransposon expression or mobility are increasingly recognized to contribute to normal development and tissue homeostasis, as well as to aging and disease. While it is well characterized that retrotransposon sequences may provide cis regulatory elements for neighboring genes, how their own expression and mobility are achieved in different somatic contexts is not well understood. Here, using long-read DNA sequencing, we characterize somatic retrotransposition in the Drosophila intestine. We show that retroelement mobility does not change significantly upon aging and is limited to very few active sub-families of retrotransposons. Importantly, we identify a polymorphic donor locus of an endogenous LTR retroviral element rover, active in the intestinal tissue. We reveal that gut activity of the rover donor copy depends on its genomic environment. Without affecting local gene expression, the copy co-opts its upstream enhancer sequence, rich in transcription factor binding sites, for somatic expression. Further we show that escargot, a snail-type transcription factor critical for gut progenitor cell function, can drive transcriptional activity of the active rover copy. These data provide new insights into how locus-specific features allow active retrotransposons to produce functional transcripts and mobilize in a somatic lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

However, much of the supporting evidence was developed using the statistic D, which assumes, without testing, both that mutation rate is constant and that recurrent mutations are vanishingly rare. These assumptions together preclude an alternative explanation based on variation in mutation rates across human populations. Here we critically evaluate the assumptions underlying D and confirm that neither is valid. Over 40% of SNPs in dbSNP carry recurrent mutations. Theory indicates that D does not vary with mutation rate as long as the mutation rate does not vary between populations. In practice, D calculated separately for different sequence motifs varies greatly, implying strongly that mutation rates do vary between populations. We show that most, if not all, D-informative sites result from two mutations rather than the one mutation expected under the introgression hypothesis. Moreover, individual non-Africans carry a signal in more than five times as many genomic windows as can be accounted for by the 2% legacy they are thought to carry, indicating a signal that is radically more diffuse than expected. Remarkably, partitioning the data by whether the chimpanzee or Neanderthal allele is the major allele in humans reveals that the overall reported D-value of ~5% actually comprises two opposing components: one with D ~ 30% and another with D ~ -25%. Tellingly, the positive component is produced by sites where the Neanderthal allele is the major allele, the exact opposite of what should be the case under introgression, where introgressed alleles should be rare. We show further that the entire D signal can be accounted for by sites where the Neanderthal allele is fixed outside Africa and the chimpanzee allele is rare inside Africa. Investigating potential mechanisms, we extend the published observation that the mutability of three-base combinations across human populations is influenced by flanking sequence heterozygosity to reveal how genomic regions that lost more heterozygosity out of Africa exhibit higher D-values. This correlation supports a model where loss of heterozygosity slowed the mutation rate, thereby reducing the divergence between Neanderthals and non-Africans. Across independent tests, our findings consistently indicate that the mutation rate variation hypothesis provides a more compelling explanation for the observed patterns in human-Neanderthal genetic relationships than the introgression hypothesis. We argue that the mutation rate variation hypothesis would help settle a number of conflicting patterns in the literature and, hence, that the concept of archaic introgression into humans and its implications for hominin-derived traits warrants reconsideration.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

We identify BNST neurons defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3, VGluT3. VGluT3 neurons were localized to anteromedial BNST, were molecularly distinct from accumbal VGluT3 neurons, and co-express vesicular GABA transporter (VGaT). Cell-type specific presynaptic processes were identified in arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), regions critical for feeding and homeostatic regulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, while these neurons co-express VGluT3 and VGaT, they functionally transmit GABA to both ARC and PVN, with rare glutamate co-transmission to ARC. Neuronal recordings of VGluT3 BNST neurons showed greater calcium-dependent signaling in response to sucrose consumption while sated compared with fasted. When fasted, optogenetic stimulation of BNST VGluT3 neurons decreased sucrose consumption using several stimulation conditions but not when stimulation occurred prior to sucrose access, suggesting that BNST VGluT3 activation concurrent with consumption in the fasted state reduces feeding. BNST VGluT3 activation during anxiety-like paradigms (novelty-suppressed feeding, open field, and elevated zero maze) and real-time place conditioning resulted in no changes in anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior. We interpret these data such that VGluT3 BNST neurons represent a unique cellular population within the BNST that provides inhibitory input to hypothalamic regions to decrease feeding without affecting anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

In most conditioned suppression studies, forward conditioning is used where a cue predicts an aversive stimulus. However, backward conditioning, in which an aversive stimulus predicts a cue, provides unique insights into learned avoidance due to its influence on both conditioned excitation and inhibition. We trained mice to consume sucrose in context A, associated an aversive stimulus in context B to few or many forward or backwards paired cues (CS+), and then tested for conditioned suppression in context A in response to the CS+. We found that few or many forward CS+ and few backward CS+ produced conditioned suppression, but many backwards cues did not. Administration of diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, prevented conditioned suppression to the backward CS+ but not to the forward CS+. Furthermore, freezing behavior was observed in response to the forward CS+ but not the backward CS+, and diazepam had no effect on freezing or locomotion. We next examined BNST GABA neurons for potential sensitivity to backwards cues and conditioned suppression. VGaT BNST signaling increased in response to sucrose licks during the backward CS+ but not to licks outside the CS+ and not to the backward CS+ onset or offset. Using designer receptors, we found that BNST VGaT neuron activation, but not its inhibition, prevented backward conditioned suppression expression. We conclude that backward conditioned suppression is dependent on both positive allosteric modulation of GABA on GABA-A receptors by diazepam and BNST GABA neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Although the use of RNA-degraded tissues in transcriptome analysis remains controversial, such samples are sometimes the sole means to address specific questions. Current studies on the impact of PMI on transcriptome data are limited to large-scale RNA-seq, which ignores cellular heterogeneity. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects caused by PMI is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Here, we investigated the impact of PMI on cellular components and gene expression using snRNA-seq data from mouse brain tissues of post-mortem. We collected samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time at 25 C prior to snRNA-seq, covering the entire range of RIN values. The different effects on the PMI to the degradation rate of mRNA and rRNA within nuclei, and the mRNA presented a more stable state. Multi-channel analysis revealed the preferential transient depletion oligodendrocytes and OPCs with increasing PMI. In addition, a rapid widespread overregulation of ribosomal transient recruitment to protein (RP) genes in various cells, and reached a plateau at PMI of 36h. Although state depletion of neuronal cells was not detected, we reported significant upregulation of PMI-dependent RP genes in its subpopulations and their cell loss. Moreover, RP genes showed the greatest differential expression in the subpopulations with greater cell perturbation, and we speculated that aberrant expression of these genes might be associated with cell death. In this study, we systematically investigated the changes in the transcriptome profile of brain tissue induced by PMI at single-cell resolution, and revealed one of the important factors that might be responsible for the changes. In addition, our data complemented a possible explanation for the changes in the cellular state of brain tissue induced by postmortem hypoxia-ischemia, and provided a reference for transcriptome studies of RNA degradation samples.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

The coordinated determination of cell fates is crucial in any developmental process and requires extensive intercellular communication. Plants cells exchange many molecular signals via the symplasmic pathway, i.e., via plasmodesmata: narrow channels connecting the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells. Regulation of symplasmic transport is vital for normal plant development, and mutations that disrupt this regulation are often embryo or seedling lethal. In many tissues, symplasmic transport of small molecules is diffusion driven, resulting in a non-selective and bidirectional transport, although net directionality could arise from gradients. This has led to the (dogmatic) belief that symplasmic transport can only be detrimental to pattern formation, because signalling molecules cannot be confined, and gradients would fade. Here, we develop a detailed biophysical description of symplasmic transport to explore how plasmodesmata affect gradients in a linear tissue. We then apply the model in more complex tissue contexts, observing and explaining, e.g., that symplasmic transport may result in steeper gradients in the root apical meristem. In conclusion, our model provides a reference framework for estimating the consequences of symplasmic transport and explains how symplasmic transport can contribute to more robust developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

Most of these delicate structures must survive for an organism's lifetime, meaning up to a century in humans. Long-term maintenance and sustained functionality of axons requires motor protein-driven transport distributing life-sustaining materials and organelles to places of need. It seems therefore plausible that loss of motor function can cause axon degeneration; however, also gain-of-function conditions were linked to disorders including motor neuron disease or spastic paraplegia. To understand this phenomenon, we studied ~40 genetic manipulations of motor proteins, cargo linkers and regulators of reactive oxygen species in one standardised Drosophila primary neuron system. Using axonal microtubule bundle organisation as a relevant readout reflecting the state of axon integrity, we found that losses of Dynein heavy chain, KIF1A/Unc-104 and KIF5/Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) all cause bundle disintegration in the form of chaotically curled microtubules. Detailed functional studies of Khc and its adaptor proteins revealed that losses of mitochondrial or lysosomal transport cause ROS dyshomeostasis, which is a condition that inducing MT-curling in fly and mouse neurons alike. We find that hyper-activated Khc induces the same MT-curling phenotype, not through ROS but directly through enhanced mechanical forces. Studies with loss of Unc-104 and expression of an ALS-linked mutant form of the human Khc orthologue KIF5A suggest that the two mechanisms apply to motors beyond Khc. We discuss a model which can explain the surprising common outcome of both conditions and examine its relevance for understanding motor-linked neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736114859787

In this vaccine, the Cys538 in the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is linked, through a thiosuccinimide linker, to lysine residues of tetanus toxoid (TT) preparation. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that TT is a complex mixture of proteins, similar to other TTs where the detoxified tetanus neurotoxin (d-TeNT) has been shown to be the most abundant protein (30-56%), regardless the quantification method used. The fifteen most abundant proteins account for approximately 78% of the total proteins. LC-MS/MS analysis of the activation process showed that 102 out of 107 lysine residues in the d-TeNT incorporated a maleimide group. In contrast, when tryptic peptides isolated by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, only 22 Lys residues in the d-TeNT were cross-linked to the RBD C-terminal tryptic peptide (538CVNF541-HHHHHH), probably due to steric hindrance. Twelve and eighteen conjugation sites were assigned based on the identification of linear peptides carrying a conjugated lysine residues ({Delta}m = +1454.58 Da or {Delta}m = +1472.59 Da) and cross-linked peptides with stabilized linker forms, respectively. Eight conjugation sites were coincidently assigned by both strategies. The assignment of the conjugation sites was manually validated by observed regularities (z[&ge;]3+, XIC, immonium ions, specific linker fragment ions) not considered by the identification software (PEAKS, Kojak and pLink2). The RBD was also conjugated, but to a lesser extent, to ten other low abundance carrier proteins. To our knowledge, this work is the first report of conjugation site assignment in a TT-based conjugate vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1736114859787
