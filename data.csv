However, their chromatin organization has remained enigmatic until now. In this study, we present the first structures of Asgard chromatin assemblies formed by the Hodarchaeal histone HHoB. Our high-resolution cryo-EM structures reveal that this Asgard histone assembles into compact ""closed"" and into extended ""open"" hypernucleosomes. Thus the closed hypernucleosome conformation is conserved across archaeal lineages, while the open conformation resembles a eukaryotic H3-H4 octasome and likely represents an Asgard-specific innovation. Moreover, we show that Mg2+ ions influence Asgard chromatin conformation, suggesting a regulatory role. Overall, our study provides the first structure-based model of Asgard chromatin organization, expanding our understanding of chromatin architecture in evolutionary context.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB. These results suggest that accounting for phylogenetic and sampling biases is essential to realizing the full potential of large sequence models in variant effect prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619

Combining spatial transcriptomics, comparative genomics, and genome editing, we show that temperature-mediated plasticity in the size of eyespot wing patterns in satyrid butterflies, a derived seasonal adaptation evolved ~80 million years ago in this subfamily, is associated with the taxon-specific evolution of a novel promoter in the Hox gene Antennapedia (Antp). The promoter activates Antp expression specifically in satyrid eyespot center cells, sensitizes these cells to environmental temperatures, and plays a critical role in regulating satyrid eyespot size plasticity. Our study demonstrates that a taxon-specific cis-regulatory innovation in an ancestral developmental gene fueled the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity across a clade of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Conjugative plasmids play a crucial role in ARG spread across hosts within their host range, yet the genetic and functional determinants shaping plasmid host range remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed the gene content of conjugative/mobilizable plasmids from public databases and found that two distinct survival strategies were enriched in different host-range groups: a ""stealth"" strategy, which minimizes host fitness costs by employing a global regulator h-ns, was particularly enriched in broad-host-range plasmids, whereas an ""aggressive"" strategy, which protects plasmids by actively inhibiting host response including SOS response by encoding the SOS inhibitor psiB, was more common in narrow-host-range plasmids. Plasmids employing either strategy constituted the majority of all conjugative plasmids analyzed, and accumulated significantly more ARGs than plasmids with neither strategy. Our data further suggested that stealth plasmids facilitate the acquisition of emerging ARGs, while aggressive plasmids amplify the copy number of established ARGs. This ""stealth-first"" model successfully recapitulated historical ARG dissemination patterns. These findings provide critical insights into the relationship between plasmid survival strategies and host range, advancing our understanding of the global patterns underlying plasmid-mediated ARG transmission.

This raises the hitherto untested possibility that heterogeneity of the untransformed tumor stroma can actively fuel malignant progression. As biological heterogeneity is inherently difficult to define and control, we here chose a highly reductionist bottom-up approach and let tumor cells invade into micro-engineered environments harboring obstacles with precision-controlled geometry. We find that not only the presence of obstacles, but more surprisingly their spatial disorder, causes a drastic shift from a collective to a single-cell mode of invasion. Combining live-imaging and perturbation experiments with minimal biophysical modeling, we demonstrate that cellular detachments result both from local geometrical constraints and a global temporal integration of the heterogeneity experienced during the invasion process. We show that different types of microenvironments map onto different universality classes of invasion dynamics, which can quantitatively explain our findings. We thus identify generic physical principles for how the mode of cancer cell invasion depends on environmental heterogeneity, with implications to understand tumor evolution in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

The occurrence of mycorrhizae is now well established in c. 85% of extant plants, yet the geological record of these associations is sparse. Fossil evidence from early Paleozoic terrestrial environments provides rare insights into these ancient symbioses, but imaging micro-scale fossil fungi in surrounding plant tissues is challenging. We employed brightfield microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and Raman spectroscopy to investigate a newly identified endomycorrhizal fungus within a 407-million-year-old plant from the Windyfield Chert. An exquisite preservation and our advanced imaging approach enabled the description of the fungal structures to unprecedented detail. The fungus, Rugosomyces lavoisieriae gen. nov., & sp. nov., exhibits structural features resembling modern Glomeromycotina arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Combining CLSM with FLIM provides extra information by separating features based upon fluorescence lifetime. Raman spectroscopy indicates that fungal arbuscules and plant water-conducting cells have undergone geological alterations, resulting in a similar chemical composition. These findings enhance our understanding of ancient plant-fungal symbioses and demonstrate the potential of advanced imaging techniques in paleobotanical research.

Significance statementMost living plants form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, but how this ancient evolutionary relationship developed is poorly understood. Exceptional fossil materials preserve direct evidence of endomycorrhizae, but imaging micro-scale fossil fungi inside plant cells is challenging. Here we use confocal microscopy combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging and Raman spectroscopy to study a new endomycorrhizal fungus inside a 400-million-year-old plant. We document structures resembling modern Glomeromycotina. We show that the residual organic matter of the fungus and the plant cell walls has a very short fluorescence lifetime, which provides a new means of imaging these fossils. Raman spectroscopy indicates that both arbuscules and water-conducting cells were geologically altered by their diagenetic history and that they now have a similar chemical composition.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was 'mosaic' with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as 'inter-individual' heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework. The inferred metapopulation dynamics not only fully explains the divergence among all available contemporary and ancient genomes of African hunter-gatherers, which were used to calibrate the model, but also accurately predicts the patterns of craniometric diversification across the continent from the Middle Pleistocene to the present. Furthermore, we show how the climate-driven changes in population sizes and connectivity predict major patterns of archaeological and phenotypic diversification over the last 200,000 years across the African continent.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Expanding this space to include noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs) offers new opportunities for probing novel interactions and engineering proteins with enhanced or entirely new functions. Some NCAAs also offer practical advantages, such as increased proteolytic stability and reduced immunogenicity, as they are rarely encountered by the human immune system. Here, we present RareFold, a deep learning model capable of accurate structure prediction for proteins containing both the 20 canonical amino acids and an additional 29 NCAAs. By treating each amino acid as a distinct token, RareFold learns residue-specific atomic interaction patterns, enabling precise modelling of chemically diverse sequences. This tokenised representation also supports sequence-structure co-optimisation, allowing efficient inverse design. We leverage this capability in EvoBindRare, a design framework for generating linear and cyclic peptide binders that incorporate NCAAs. Applying EvoBindRare, we design binders targeting a ribonuclease and experimentally validate these, obtaining M affinity in both the linear and cyclic cases. RareFold thus enables binder design with an expanded chemical vocabulary, opening the door to next-generation peptide therapeutics with improved stability, specificity, and immune evasion.

Importantly, not all patients benefit from this treatment regimen, which means the number needed to treat is very high. Moreover, this makes clinical trials large and costly, limiting clinical translation. Thus, there is a high medical need to develop a first etiology-specific therapy. Mutations in RBM20, a splicing factor that targets multiple pivotal cardiac genes including TTN and CAMK2D, cause a clinically aggressive form of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Here, we hypothesized that CAMK2D is the heart disease-causing target of RBM20. We crossed Camk2d- to Rbm20-deficient mice and found that double knockout (DKO) mice were protected from heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Phosphorylation of multiple CAMK2D targets was increased in Rbm20-deficient mouse hearts, which was reverted in DKO hearts, confirming that CAMK2D is not only misspliced but also overactivated. AAV9-mediated re-expression of single CAMK2D splice variants in DKO mice reintroduced cardiac dysfunction irrespective of the splice variant, unmasking that overactivation rather than missplicing underlies the detrimental phenotype. To test whether heart failure could pharmacologically be reversed, we treated heterozygous Rbm20-R636Q knock-in (KI) mice with hesperadin, a potent CAMK2 inhibitor, which rescued both cardiac function and ventricular geometry. These data demonstrate that overactivation of CAMK2D underlies heart failure in RBM20 cardiomyopathy. Pharmacological inhibition of CAMK2D could therefore become the first cause-directed DCM therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

This is especially the case for enzymes involved in glycosylation that, when mutated in human patients, are causing the disease congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). To resemble the patient conditions, it would be ideal to acutely modulate the proteins in question to directly interfere with protein levels of such essential enzymes. These methods offer to establish pathogenic enzyme levels resembling net enzyme activity reported from patients suffering from CDG, with Phosphomannomutase 2 - CDG (PMM2-CDG) as the most common form. We established an auxin-inducible acute protein knockdown system for the use in the teleost fish medaka (Oryzias latipes) by combining an improved degron (AID2) technology with a mAID-nanobody targeting endogenously GFP-tagged Pmm2 protein. We generated a fishline expressing a functional Pmm2-GFP fusion protein, by single copy integration of GFP into the pmm2 locus. Upon induction, the degron system efficiently reduced Pmm2-GFP levels and enzyme activity, recapitulating the activity level of the hypomorphic mutations associated with PMM2-CDG in patients. This broadly applicable approach enables the investigation of CDG disease mechanisms during early embryonic development through reduction of protein abundance mimicking hypomorphic mutations and thus substantially expands the range of the genetic toolbox.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Here, we investigate the genetic diversity, population structure, and demographic history of the islands by analyzing whole genome sequencing data from 40 participants in the Faroe Genome Project. This represents the first whole genome sequencing panel of this size from the Faroe Islands. We observed numerous putatively functional private alleles, including stop gain variants and high impact missense variants in the cohort. Faroese individuals had a higher proportion of their genomes contained in long runs of homozygosity than other European groups, including Finnish, suggesting a more recent or stronger bottleneck in the Faroese population. Signals of positive selection were identified at loci containing genes that play roles in vitamin D and dietary fat absorption and DNA repair, while increased diversity on lactase persistence haplotypes was observed. Fine-scale analysis of haplotype structure in modern and ancient European genomes revealed genetic affinities with ancient Iron Age individuals from the North and West of Europe, providing evidence for potential contributions to the Faroese gene pool from Celtic and Viking populations as well as information about the temporal order in which these events happened. This study highlights the impact of evolutionary processes, such as ancient admixture, founder events, and positive selection, on the present-day genetic architecture of North Atlantic founder populations like the Faroe Islands.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Although recent studies have explored the relationship between gut microbiota and female life history, the link between gut microbiota and male life history remains understudied. In this study, we explored the role of gut microbiota in shaping male life history traits by correlating variation in life history traits across genetically homogeneous isolines with their naturally occurring gut microbiota. Using 22 isolines from the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), we measured lifespan, early/late-life reproduction, and early/late-life physiological performance. We characterized the gut microbiota composition in young (5 days old) and old (26 days old) flies using 16S rDNA sequencing. We observed significant variation in male life history traits across isolines, as well as age-related changes in gut microbiota composition. Using machine learning, we showed that gut microbiota composition could predict the age of the organisms with high accuracy. Associations between gut microbiota and life history traits were notable, particularly involving the Acetobacter genus. In early life, the abundance of Acetobacter ascendens was associated with functional aging, while Acetobacter indonesiensis was linked to reproductive senescence. In late life, higher abundances of A. ascendens and Acetobacter pasteurianus were negatively associated with lifespan. These findings highlight the potential role of gut microbiota, especially the Acetobacter genus, in male fitness and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Here, we describe the isolation of O. hominis from samples collected from a South African birth cohort, creating the first archive of cultured strains of the species from Africa. Sequenced genomes from this archive reveal that South African O. hominis is more similar to Australian strains than those from Southeast Asia, and that it may share genes with other members of the microbiome that are relevant for virulence, colonisation, and antibiotic resistance. Leveraging existing microbiome data from the cohort, O. hominis was found to be closely associated with bacterial co-colonisers that are rare in non-carrier individuals, including Suttonella, Helcococcus, Moraxella spp., and Gracilibacteria. Their collective acquisition has a significant impact on the diversity of nasopharyngeal communities that contain O. hominis. Individuals who have not yet acquired O. hominis have a higher abundance of Moraxella (particularly M. lincolnii) than individuals who never acquire O. hominis, suggesting that this could be a precursor state for successful colonisation.

This involves cell-surface receptors that can detect conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or endogenous immunogenic signals, initiating signaling pathways to induce broad-spectrum disease resistance, known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) MIK2 is an exceptionally versatile receptor involved in the perception of the vast family of Brassicales-specific endogenous SCOOP peptides as well as potential MAMPs derived from Fusarium and related fungi. Although only plant species belonging to the order of Brassicales encode genes for SCOOP peptides and show SCOOP-responsiveness, the Fusarium-derived elicitor fraction also induces PTI responses in plants from other lineages. In this study, we demonstrate that Fusarium elicitor-responsiveness and proteins belonging to the MIK2-clade are widely conserved among seed plants. We identified a MIK2-clade protein from tomato, which shares properties of AtMIK2 in the perception of the Fusarium elicitor but not of SCOOP peptides. Tomato mutants lacking the receptor show compromised PTI responses to the fungal elicitor and enhanced susceptibility to infection by Fusarium oxysporum. Our data provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of MIK2 as a multifunctional receptor involved in plant immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

In inflamed joints, lining macrophages regulate both early inflammatory cell influx and resolution. Despite these critical functions, it is currently unknown at what stage during development the synovial macrophage lining is established, and which signals drive this process. Here, we use a combination of genetic models and in vivo perturbations, single cell transcriptomics and imaging to delineate the process of lining formation in mice. We find that the synovial lining is immature at birth and becomes established within the first 3 weeks of life. In this window, the lining is gradually populated with macrophages that originate from fetal sources, proliferate and acquire the lining-specific transcriptional identity. In contrast, monocytes contribute only minimally to the developing lining, and their input remains limited in healthy adulthood. We identify CSF1 and TGF{beta} as key signals in this process, which also involves mechanosensing through PIEZO1. Our study thus identifies the early postnatal window as a critical period for lining macrophage development, with potential lifelong impact on joint health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Whole-cortex functional gradients, which organize regions along axes of functional similarity, are positioned here as a framework for understanding such alterations. Across two independent cohorts (BioFINDER-2, N=973; ADNI, N=129), we demonstrate that hyper- and hypoconnectivity in both healthy aging and biomarker-confirmed AD progression coexist systematically, forming consistent spatial patterns that align with two distinct axes of brain organization. Using a combination of longitudinal and non-linear analyses, we show that the early (but not late) stages of AD pathology accumulation is associated with functional alteration along the sensory-association axis, a pattern that vanishes in later stages of AD. However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan. These findings highlight the fundamental role of intrinsic functional organization in shaping how the brain responds to aging and to AD, helping to resolve previously reported discrepancies.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Allostatic overload occurs when environmental challenges surpass an individual's ability to cope. The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected pregnant women to an unprecedented amount of stress and uncertainty, and this situation has been linked to higher rates of mental health disorders, especially during lockdowns and the early stages of the pandemic. Contributing factors potentially include gender-based violence, gender inequality, multidimensional poverty, barriers to healthcare, isolation, and social restrictions, among others. Perinatal mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, have lasting health effects on both mothers and their children and could be significant risk factors for allostatic overload. Maternal mood and anxiety disorders during pregnancy have been linked to cardiovascular diseases, particularly ischemic heart disease, years after childbirth. Additionally, there is evidence showing the cardiovascular impacts of COVID-19, including an increased expression of thrombosis biomarkers in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Aim To evaluate the impact of allostatic overload during pregnancy, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, on mothers' cardiovascular health, children's neurodevelopment, and the mother-child relationship. Study design We propose a historical cohort study focused on mothers who were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-2021). We will retrospectively assess exposure to allostatic overload during the perinatal period by triangulating both quantitative and qualitative data. The outcomes for mother-child dyads will be evaluated prospectively. Methods We propose to study 32 exposed and 64 control subjects to reject the null hypothesis that the relative risk equals 1. This sample size was estimated to detect a significantly higher relative risk of ischemic heart disease. The primary outcomes will be: 1) Manifestation or higher risk of ischemic heart disease in the mothers. 2) Neurodevelopmental disorders in children. 3) Alterations in the mother and child relationship. To assess exposure to allostatic overload, we will conduct a clinimetric survey and narrative interviews to explore life experiences and identify significant stressors during the perinatal period. The potential association between allostatic overload and health later in life will be analysed using multivariable epidemiological analyses and machine learning techniques. Expected results We anticipate a higher prevalence of allostatic overload in women who experienced pregnancy during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the later period. It is proposed that these women may face an increased risk of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and ischemic heart disease due to allostatic overload. Additionally, we expect to observe changes in plasma biomarkers related to cardiovascular health and a higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in their children. Furthermore, increased parental stress associated with allostatic overload during pregnancy may lead to a poorer mother-child relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619

Here, we present the deepest sequence coverage screen of the bacterial N-degron pathway using combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1). We observe lowered stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in bulky residues and Gln as well as heightened stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in negatively charged residues, Gly, and Pro, particularly when these residues are at P2.

In this context, genetic mechanisms that produce diverse neurons with correct local identity remain unknown. Here, we report the discovery of factors important for regenerative neurogenesis of dopaminergic neurons in the planarian central, peripheral, and pharyngeal nervous systems. Distinct genes promote dopaminergic neuronal identity and instruct neurons to inhabit regions of the nervous system.

ResultsTextual data from 90 HCWs were collected from within the initial 166 respondents to the survey. Most respondents were unvaccinated, had been terminated for non-compliance with vaccination mandates, experienced personal losses, and reported negative views on mandates and their impacts on patient care. We identified six themes: 1) policies conflicting with scientific evidence and professional practice; 2) conflicts with medical ethics; 3) unacknowledged or dismissed personal hardships; 4) unacknowledged or dismissed physical harms; 5) discrimination against unvaccinated HCWs and patients; and 6) negative impacts on patient care.

ConclusionsThis study uncovered a concerning pattern within British Columbias healthcare system, with mandatory vaccination leading to substantial social and economic harms for HCWs of all vaccination statuses as well as unvaccinated patients. Mandates appear to have exacerbated labour shortages in the healthcare sector, negatively impacted workplace morale and the quality of patient care, and eroded informed consent. In light of these findings and of available scientific evidence then and now, we conclude that the policy of mandatory vaccination for HCWs has no scientific basis and violates fundamental ethical principles in healthcare practice and policy.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619

Nbs towards soluble proteins are routinely developed via alpaca immunization or directed evolution in yeast cell-surface display. However, for membrane proteins, the targets are generally detergent-solubilized, and there remains a need for Nb development methods against membrane proteins in a native-like membrane environment. To address this need, we present a protocol for Nb selection via extraction of membrane proteins into amphiphilic polymers such as styrene-maleic acid to produce purified membrane proteins in stable liponanoparticles. Proof of generality is demonstrated by applying the pipeline to four membrane-resident enzymes of differing fold, oligomerization state, and membrane topology (reentrant membrane helix, transmembrane, membrane-associated). Following screening for optimal stabilization into liponanoparticles, Nbs were selected against four target proteins from glycoconjugate biosynthesis pathways. The selected Nbs showed high affinity and selectivity towards their target proteins with KD apparent values ranging from 15 nM to 200 nM, depending on the Nb-protein conjugate. In accordance with their tight binding, various Nb-protein complexes were found to be stable to size-exclusion chromatography purification. The Nbs were also amenable to sortase-mediated ligation, enabling their conversion into molecular probes for the target membrane protein. The ability to select for such high-affinity Nb against membrane proteins in SMALP will facilitate their widespread application in cell biology and biomedical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Using mathematical modeling, we elucidate that the bistability arising from the self-enhancing homing process of antigen-presenting dendritic cells plays a key role in the time-of-day-dependent adaptive immune response. Modeling analyses of circadian-controlled immune responses to three vaccine types demonstrate that vaccine-specific differences in time-of-day-dependent immunity originate from distinctions in the circadian-regulated activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This divergence is amplified by bistability in the dendritic cell homing process, resulting in long-term distinctions in adaptive immunity across vaccine types. The model results reveal a dynamic mechanism by which adaptive immune responses maintain circadian variations over extended time periods, suggesting that the timing of vaccine administration within the day is a promising strategy for effective disease prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Electrophysiologic measures of cortical excitability hold promise for monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic responses. The power law exponent (aperiodic slope) reflects the balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity within neuronal networks, a critical aspect of normal brain function often disrupted in neurological conditions. Despite its potential, the significance of the aperiodic slope in glioma-infiltrated tissue and its underlying cellular processes has not been fully investigated. Here, we integrate multi-modal electrophysiological analysis with transcriptomic profiling to analyze the aperiodic slope in both normal and glioma-infiltrated cortex. We determine that glioma infiltration induces a flattening of the aperiodic slope, indicating a shift toward excitation dominance that varies according to tumor subtype and correlates with impairments in semantic naming. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that cortical regions with flat aperiodic slope exhibit transcriptional programs enriched in glutamatergic signaling, membrane depolarization, and excitatory synaptic transmission. The aperiodic slope responds to pharmacologically induced changes in cortical inhibition during propofol administration, a GABAA agonist. Our results establish the aperiodic slope as a robust biomarker of glioma-associated excitation-inhibition imbalance, with potential applications in tumor classification and treatment monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

McdA, a member of the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, forms dynamic gradients on the nucleoid that position McdB-bound carboxysomes. McdB belongs to a widespread but poorly characterized class of ParA/MinD partner proteins, and the molecular basis of its interaction with McdA remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal 20 residues of H. neapolitanus McdB are both necessary and sufficient for interaction with McdA. Within this region, we identify three lysine residues whose individual substitution modulates McdA binding and leads to distinct carboxysome organization phenotypes. Notably, lysine 7 (K7) is critical for McdA interaction: substitutions at this site result in the formation of a single carboxysome aggregate positioned at mid-nucleoid. This phenotype contrasts with that of an McdB deletion, in which carboxysome aggregates lose their nucleoid association and become sequestered at the cell poles. These findings suggest that weakened McdA-McdB interactions are sufficient to maintain carboxysome aggregates on the nucleoid but inadequate for partitioning individual carboxysomes across it. We propose that, within the ParA/MinD family of ATPases, cargo positioning and partitioning are mechanistically separable: weak interactions with the cognate partner can mediate positioning, whereas effective partitioning requires stronger interactions capable of overcoming cargo self-association forces.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

To understand how theta-burst stimulation (TBS) over the left DLPFC influences sgACC microcircuitry, we applied spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM) with a conductance-based canonical microcircuit model (CMM-NMDA) to resting-state EEG data acquired at 2, 15, and 30 minutes following continuous TBS (cTBS), intermittent TBS (iTBS), and sham stimulation. Using a multilevel parametric empirical Bayes framework, we observed that cTBS induce wider network effect 2 min after stimulation while iTBS induce more lasting changes up to 30 min following stimulation. Unlike sham, both TBS protocols induced a transient reduction in NMDA-dependent effective connectivity from right DLPFC to left sgACC. Crucially, TBS produced sustained inhibition within left sgACC microcircuits, characterized by increased self-inhibition of spiny-satellite cells. Together, these findings demonstrate that spectral DCM can resolve the dynamic, hierarchical neuromodulatory effects of TBS in healthy brains and highlight a potential mechanism underlying the antidepressant action of left DLPFC TBS.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619

Co-transcribed with the active-VSG within a specialised nuclear body are expression-site-associated-genes (ESAGs), involved in important host-parasite interactions, including protecting the parasite from human serum lytic effects, modulating the host's innate immune response and uptake of essential nutrients. Despite expression within the same polycistron, there is a significant differential expression between ESAGs and VSGs (>140-fold), however, the regulatory mechanism has remained elusive for decades. Here, using a combination of genetic tools, super resolution microscopy, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified three novel proteins, which are recruited in a hierarchical manner, forming discreet sub-nuclear condensates that are developmentally regulated and negatively regulate ESAG transcripts. Among them, Expression-Site-Body-specific-protein-2 (ESB2) contains a nuclease domain that shares structural similarity to the endonuclease domain found in SMG6, a critical component of nonsense mediated decay in mammals. Mutation of key residues required for the nuclease activity impaired ESB2 localisation and function.

Recent advances in both sequencing and genotyping technologies has resulted in a considerable increase in the number of publicly available human ancient DNA datasets, creating new opportunities for development of methods for the inference of NFDS from time-sampled data. In this perspective, I present three brief simulation studies to show how time-sampled data can aid improve inference power. First, I show how multiple time points can help us distinguish between recent NFDS and partial selective sweeps based on allele frequency trajectories. I then demonstrate how selective effects can be distinguished from population history based on changes in genetic variation and the site frequency spectrum over time. Finally, I apply an approximate Bayesian computation approach to compare the power of multiple and single time point datasets in estimating the time for which NFDS has been shaping variation for. Thus, I show how data from multiple timepoints can facilitate the generation of new methodological approaches for better inference of NFDS.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Placebo analgesia can be induced through verbal suggestion, classical conditioning, or their combination, though the role of conditioned neural responses above and beyond effects of verbal instructions remains unclear. We conducted a systematic meta-analysis of individual participant data from 16 within-participant placebo neuroimaging studies (n = 409), employing univariate and multivariate analyses to identify shared and distinct mechanisms of placebo analgesia induced by suggestions alone versus suggestions combined with conditioning. Both techniques increased activity during pain in the dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices and decreased activation in the insula, putamen, and primary sensory areas. Adding conditioning enhanced engagement of regions associated with context representation and pain modulation (e.g., dorsolateral/dorsomedial prefrontal cortices) and decreases in nociceptive regions (e.g., primary sensory and insular areas). Conditioning also strengthened the association between analgesia and nociceptive activity, as reflected in the Neurologic Pain Signature. Combining conditioning with instructions yielded greater analgesia, mediated by increased ventromedial prefrontal and dorsal caudate activity, alongside decreased sensory-nociceptive and cerebellar activity. These findings suggest the two strategies rely on partially distinct mechanisms, which could be combined to optimize placebo analgesias clinical application.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

In this work, we extend Mumemto by introducing two new partitioning and merging strategies. Both strategies enable highly parallel, memory efficient, and updateable computation of multi-MUMs. One of the strategies, called string-based merging, is also capable of conducting the merges in a way that follows the shape of a phylogenetic tree, naturally yielding the multi-MUM for the tree's internal nodes as well as the root.

By storing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the form of neutral lipids, LDs can either mitigate or exacerbate lipotoxic damage. However, the role of LDs in regulating cellular fatty acid distribution, membrane unsaturation and ferroptosis susceptibility remains poorly understood. Here, we show that inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-mediated LD biogenesis in PUFA-supplemented triple-negative breast cancer cells induces widespread lipidome rearrangements and membrane phospholipid acyl-chain remodelling, promoting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis sensitivity. Lipidomic analyses reveal that LDs efficiently sequester exogenous PUFAs within triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, significantly altering the unsaturation profiles of these neutral lipids. When LD formation is impaired by DGAT inhibition, PUFAs are redistributed into membrane ester and ether glycerophospholipids, enhancing overall membrane unsaturation, lipid peroxidation, and increasing ferroptosis susceptibility, even in the absence of additional ferroptosis inducers. In contrast, in ferroptosis- and PUFA-resistant lung cancer cells, LDs exhibit a dual role, whereby the mode of ferroptosis induction and PUFA loading determined whether DGAT inhibition promoted or protected against ferroptosis. The pro-ferroptotic function of LDs predominates in these cells, particularly under conditions of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) deficiency. This study highlights LDs as multifaceted regulators of ferroptosis sensitivity, integrating metabolic and redox quality control pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Given the clinical significance of cyclic peptides containing unnatural residues as a therapeutic modality, we present the first systematic evaluation of AlphaFold3 for this class of molecules. To facilitate benchmarking, we developed an automated input pipeline to streamline AlphaFold3 predictions for cyclic peptides. Our study aims to: (1) quantify the hierarchical accuracy (all-atoms, C atoms, and atoms of unnatural residue levels) of AlphaFold3 in predicting both non-canonical cyclic peptide monomers and complexes; (2) assess the reliability of AlphaFold3 confidence metrics; (3) evaluate the influence of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and structural templates; and (4) identify systematic biases in AlphaFold3 predictions. Based on these analyses, we provide practical guidelines for applying AlphaFold3 in cyclic peptide structure prediction for facilitating the related research of bioactive cyclic peptides.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

The potential for fibrosis across most organ systems may stem from its connections to wound healing and the ubiquitous presence of vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells (ECs) and angiogenesis, cells and associated biological program central to wound healing, have been heavily implicated in many organ-specific fibroses, but the relationship between angiogenesis and fibrogenesis remains debated and little has been established in terms of how the EC phenotype governs tissue healing vs. fibrosis. Here, we examine a murine lung injury model enabling EC lineage tracing and observe the invasion of aberrant ECs from the bronchial microvasculature following lung injury along with concurrent densification of matrix fibers surrounding these vessels. To investigate the underlying mechanisms governing their appearance, we established a microphysiological system (MPS) of arteriole/venule-scale microvessels embedded within a tunable stromal mimetic matrix and find that heightened extracellular matrix fiber density activates ECs, drives endothelial to mesenchymal transition, and promotes aberrant tip EC (ATEC) invasion into the matrix. ATECs remain adherent to fibrotic matrix and possess a pro-inflammatory phenotype that secretes TGF-b2. Notably, our studies establish that the formation of ATECs is gated by destabilization of endothelial adherens junction upon EC adhesion to fibrous matrix, and associated regulation of TGF-b signaling that is mediated by a novel VE-cadherin -- TGF-bR2 axis. The current lack of effective anti-fibrotic therapies suggests potential critical involvement of other cell types such as ECs, and our findings suggest new contributions of ECs to fibrotic progression that may better inform future targets for novel anti-fibrotic therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Meloidogyne hapla, a diploid species, is a valuable model for studying root-knot nematodes due to its parasitic diversity, small genome, and a reproductive strategy that facilitates genetic analysis. Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-scale assembly of M. hapla, generated using multiple sequencing platforms including PacBio HiFi, ONT, Illumina and HiC. The 59 Mb assembly comprises 16 chromosome-length scaffolds, notably lacking canonical telomeric repeats. Instead, we identified a tandem 16-mer repeat mainly present at scaffold ends, suggesting an alternative system for chromosome-end maintenance. Genetic linkage analysis of F2 populations derived from crosses between M. hapla strains validated the assembly but also revealed anomalies indicating chromosome structure differences between parental isolates such as fissions, fusions and rearrangements. This analysis also revealed sharply delineated zones of high recombination on most chromosome arms. We also identified 1,258 genes encoding putative secreted proteins (PSP), which should be enriched in genes involved host interaction and pathogenicity. Most of the PSP genes had orthologs in other plant parasitic nematode species, and the majority were pioneers, lacking known functional domains. Notably, we found that PSPs are significantly enriched in high-recombination zones, possibly facilitating their rapid evolution. Overall, our study provides new insights into genome structure of diploid root-knot nematodes and highlights the interplay between genome architecture, recombination, and parasitism. These findings raise new questions about how genetic and genomic adaptations drive the success of root-knot nematodes as plant parasites.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Upon activation, DCs undergo changes in their transcriptome, phenotype, and function, depending on the tissue microenvironment. The role of DC activation during human chronic inflammation has yet to be explored. To address this, we aimed to investigate activated DCs across a range of chronically inflamed human tissues, with a focus on cervical lymph nodes (LNs). We performed scRNAseq and flow cytometry on healthy, acutely, chronically inflamed, and cancer-associated human cervical (LNs) and identified a novel inflammation-associated DC (iaDC) cell state, found only within chronically inflamed LNs. iaDCs were defined by a unique cytokine expression profile (CXCL9, CXCL10, IL1B) and could be phenotypically distinguished from other activated DCs by their elevated expression of CD1C, CD206, CD319, and CD274. Functionally, we found that IFNg signaling induces DC2s to enter the iaDC cell state and that this process can be abrogated by inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we observed LN iaDC residing within a specific chronic inflammatory niche, which was enriched for inflammatory monocytes, NK cells, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Extrapolating our findings to other chronic inflammation-associated diseases, we similarly observed the emergence of iaDCs within the intestines of treatment-resistant Crohns Disease patients, synovial membranes and lymph nodes of rheumatoid arthritis patients and lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Similarly to the lymph node, iaDCs were found to reside in conserved chronic inflammation-associated spatial niches within the small intestine of affected individuals and displayed equivalent transcriptional characteristics and surrounding cellular neighborhoods. Collectively, these data highlight a previously unexplored role of iaDCs in human chronic inflammatory diseases and propose a conserved spatially restricted iaDC-populated chronic inflammatory niche associated with resistance to therapy. These findings highlight novel avenues to shape inflammatory trajectories by targeting iaDCs and their spatial niches, for example, by inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

However, even under carefully controlled conditions, stem cell-derived models exhibit substantial ""inter-individual"" heterogeneity. Focusing on gastruloids, a powerful model of the early posterior embryo1, we sought to investigate the origins of this heterogeneity. To this end, we developed a scalable protocol for generating gastruloids that are monoclonal, i.e. derived from a single mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Single cell transcriptional profiling of monoclonal gastruloids revealed extensive inter-individual heterogeneity, with some hardly progressing, others resembling conventional gastruloids but biased towards mesodermal or neural lineages, and yet others bearing cell types rare or absent from conventional polyclonal gastruloids. To investigate this further, we leveraged DNA Typewriter2 to record the cell lineage relationships among the mESCs from which monoclonal gastruloids originate. Early in the expansion of ""founder"" mESCsprior to induction of the resulting aggregates to form gastruloidswe observe clear examples of fate bias or fate restriction, i.e. sister clades that exhibit markedly different cell type compositions. In a separate experiment with DNA Typewriter, we reconstructed a monophyletic ""tree of trees"", composed of [~]50,000 cells derived from [~]100 gastruloids, all descended from a single ""founder of founders"" stem cell. From these data, we find that founder mESCs that are more closely related are more likely to give rise to monoclonal gastruloids with similar cell type compositions. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the intrinsic states of mESCs are heritable, and shape their descendants fates across many cell divisions. Our study also showcases how DNA Typewriter can be used to reconstruct high-resolution, monophyletic cell lineage trees in stem cell models of early development.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

The absence of visual mental imagery, called aphantasia, has recently been recognized to occur in about 1% of the general population but the cause is uncertain. By studying rare cases of acquired aphantasia we can identify regions that when injured cause loss of visual mental imagery.

MethodsWe analyzed aphantasia lesions, identified from case reports by systematic review, and previously studied control lesions causing other neuropsychiatric symptoms (n=887). The network of brain regions connected to each lesion location was computed using resting-state functional connectivity from healthy subjects (n=1000). First, we tested the connectivity of aphantasia lesions and controls to the fusiform imagery node, a region in the ventral visual pathway which is active during visual mental imagery tasks. Then, we performed a data-driven analysis assessing whole brain lesion connectivity that was sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. Finally, we compared our aphantasia lesion network to activations previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks.

ResultsWe identified 12 cases of lesion-induced aphantasia which occurred in multiple different brain regions. However, 100% of these lesion locations were functionally connected to a region in the left fusiform gyrus, recently termed the fusiform imagery node. Connectivity to this region was both sensitive (100% overlap) and specific (family-wise error p<0.05) for aphantasia. The aphantasia lesion network aligned with functional connections previously associated with visual mental imagery tasks.

Conclusions and RelevanceLesions causing aphantasia are located in many different brain regions but are all functionally connected to a specific location in the left fusiform gyrus. These findings support the hypothesis that the fusiform imagery node is a key brain region involved in visual mental imagery and offers clinical insight into which locations of brain injury are likely to cause aphantasia.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619

Here we deliver a proof-of-concept for a cell-based immunotherapeutic approach promoting circulating DC progenitors infiltration in the tumor together with their local expansion. We report that engraftment of autologous mesenchymal stromal cells engineered to express the membrane bound form of FLT3L (eMSC-FLT3L) uniquely induce DC infiltration, T cells activation and anti-tumor immunity, when combined with an adjuvant like the poly(I:C) double stranded RNA mimic. Mechanistic experiments demonstrate that poly(I:C)-induced CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands (CXCL9, CCL5) are required for intra-tumoral DC and T cell recruitment and for the therapeutic effect of eMSC-FLT3L + poly(I:C) immunotherapy. Stromal cell-based delivery of CXCL9 and CCL5, together with FLT3L, by-passes the requirement for poly(I:C) agonist and is sufficient to induce T cell and DC recruitment within tumors.

Minor temperature oscillations can alert the pathogen to a changing niche ecosystem, necessitating efficient sensing and rapid integration to trigger behavioral change. This is typically achieved through master regulators, which act as umbrella systems dictating pleiotropic phenotypes. Here, we uncover a pivotal role of minor temperature shifts in transition of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) from commensal to virulent lifestyles, mediated via an RNA thermosensing (RNAT) element within the untranslated region of the global regulator CiaR. By positively regulating the expression of the surface adhesin, Phosphorylcholine (PCho), in response to elevated temperature, CiaR potentiates pneumococcal infection. Engineering the RNAT structure to create translation restrictive or permissive versions allowed us to demonstrate how modulation in expression of CiaR could alter pneumococcal invasion capability, influencing infection outcomes. Moreover, intranasal administration of PCho mitigated SPN-induced bacteraemic pneumonia. Since a majority of opportunistic respiratory bacterial pathogens decorate their surface with PCho, this signaling arm could be exploited for anti-infective interventions.

Significance statementOur nasopharyngeal area is dominated by opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN), which typically reside as harmless bystanders. However, in individuals with heightened nasopharyngeal inflammation, resulting from allergy, viral infection or an immature or senescent immune system, these seemingly innocuous microbes, including SPN, switch to virulent lifestyles. We reveal an elegant mechanism for rewiring of SPN virulence genes upon sensing temperature oscillations in the nasopharynx by the master regulator CiaR. Elevated nasopharyngeal temperatures due to pathologic conditions is sensed by thermosensing ciaR mRNA. This primarily promotes SPN surface decoration by PCho which facilitates improved invasion, triggering virulence phenotypes. Our findings point towards adoption of a common mechanism for switch to virulent lifestyles by variety of microbes sharing the specific respiratory niche.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

Investigating the development process is vital for uncovering the formation of complex biological systems. However, current approaches to studying development from gene expression rely primarily on single-cell gene expression data to infer developmental trajectories, neglecting the spatial distribution of cells within tissues and their interactions. Although spatial transcriptomics provides spatial context for gene expression, existing algorithms focus mainly on identifying spatial regions without further exploring their developmental connections. In this study, we propose an algorithm for detecting spatial-temporal domains in tissue to trace developmental path (stTrace) using spatial transcriptomics. stTrace integrates the degree of cell development, gene expression, and spatial location to identify ""spatial-temporal domains"", regions where cells share similar functions and developmental stages within the tissue. Moreover, hierarchical relationships exist among these regions, reflecting developmental connections between cells in the tissue. Our experiments on mouse embryo and human breast cancer data revealed that stTrace can detect more refined regions than traditional spatial domain identification algorithms. Furthermore, the directions of developmental paths inferred from hierarchical relationships are consistent with the dynamic trajectories derived from single-cell velocity.","NA","biorxiv",1748297347619

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748297347619
