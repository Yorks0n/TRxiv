However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

However, most scientists dont have access to experts from multiple fields. Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains by answering scientific questions. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates the ability of the Virtual Lab to rapidly make impactful, real-world scientific discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver. ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184, with a W193A mutation significantly rescuing cholesterol egress and correcting the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2 caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol export, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells. Similar BMP reductions were observed in cells deficient in the HOPS subunits VPS39 and VPS41, but not in VPS29-deficient retromer complex cells, suggesting that BMP reduction is independent of general lysosomal protein trafficking. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

Accumulated research evidence suggests that ME/CFS and Long COVID exhibit overlapping metabolic symptoms, indicating potential shared metabolic dysfunctions. This study aims to systematically explore shared metabolic disturbances in the muscle tissue of patients. Utilizing genome-wide metabolic modeling, we identified key metabolic irregularities in the muscle of patients with ME/CFS, notably the downregulation of the alanine and aspartate metabolism pathway and the arginine and proline metabolism pathway. Further, in silico knockout analyses suggested that supplementation with aspartate (ASP) or asparagine (ASN) could potentially ameliorate these metabolic deficiencies. In addition, assessments of metabolomic levels in Long COVID patients also showed the significant downregulation of ASP during post-exertional malaise (PEM) in both muscle and blood. Consequently, we propose that a combination of l-ornithine and l-aspartate (LOLA) is a potential candidate to alleviate metabolic symptoms in ME/CFS and Long COVID for future clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

However, the application of such annotation/manipulation systems to social behaviors, in which multiple individuals interact dynamically, remains challenging. Here, we applied an object detection algorithm to classify animal social behaviors. Our system, packaged as ""YORU"" (Your Optimal Recognition Utility), classifies animal behaviors, including social behaviors, based on the shape of the animal as a ""behavior object"". It successfully classified several types of social behaviors ranging from vertebrates to insects. We also integrated a closed-loop control system for operating optogenetic devices into the YORU package. YORU enables real-time delivery of photostimulation feedback to specific individuals during specific behaviors, even when multiple individuals are close together. We hope that the YORU system will accelerate the understanding of the neural basis of social behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

The study of this process often requires quantifying abundances of specific RNAs at precise subcellular locations. To analyze subcellular transcriptomes, multiple proximity-based techniques have been developed in which RNAs near a localized bait protein are specifically labeled, facilitating their biotinylation and purification. However, these complex methods are often laborious and require expensive enrichment reagents. To streamline the analysis of localized RNA populations, we developed Oxidation-Induced Nucleotide Conversion sequencing (OINC-seq). In OINC-seq, RNAs near a genetically encoded, localized bait protein are specifically oxidized in a photo-controllable manner. These oxidation events are then directly detected and quantified using high-throughput sequencing and our software package, PIGPEN, without the need for biotin-mediated enrichment. We demonstrate that OINC-seq can induce and quantify RNA oxidation with high specificity in a dose- and light-dependent manner. We further show the spatial specificity of OINC-seq by using it to quantify subcellular transcriptomes associated with the cytoplasm, ER, nucleus, and the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Finally, using transgenic zebrafish, we demonstrate that OINC-seq allows proximity-mediated RNA labeling in live animals. In sum, OINC-seq together with PIGPEN provide an accessible workflow for the analysis of localized RNAs across different biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

This extensive pleiotropy implies that multi-phenotype analyses are informative for characterizing genetic variation, as they facilitate the discovery of trait-specific and trait-shared variants and pathways ('genetic factors'). Previous efforts have estimated genetic factors using matrix factorization (MF) applied to numerous GWAS. However, existing methods are susceptible to spurious factors arising from residual confounding due to sample-sharing in biobank GWAS. Furthermore, MF approaches have historically estimated dense factors, loaded on most traits and variants, that are challenging to map onto interpretable biological pathways. To address these shortcomings, we introduce 'GWAS latent embeddings accounting for noise and regularization' (GLEANR), a MF method for detection of sparse genetic factors from summary statistics. GLEANR accounts for sample sharing between studies and uses regularization to estimate a data-driven number of interpretable factors. GLEANR is robust to confounding induced by shared samples and improves the replication of genetic factors derived from distinct biobanks. We used GLEANR to evaluate 137 diverse GWAS, identifying 58 factors that decompose the genetic architecture of input traits and have distinct signatures of negative selection and degrees of polygenicity. These sparse factors can be interpreted with respect to disease, cell-type, and pathway enrichment, such as three factors capturing platelet measure phenotypes enriched for disease-relevant markers corresponding to distinct stages of platelet differentiation. Overall, GLEANR is a powerful tool for discovering both trait-specific and shared pathways underlying complex traits from GWAS summary statistics.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

These reactions generate highly reducing conditions that can drive organic synthesis reactions potentially conducive to the emergence of life, while concomitantly generating fluids that are challenging for life owing to hyperalkalinity and limited inorganic carbon (and oxidant) availability. Consequently, serpentinite-hosted biospheres offer insights into the earliest life, the habitable limits for life, and the potential for life on other planets. However, the ability of serpentinites to support abundant microbial communities was only recognized [~]20 years ago with the discovery of deep-sea hydrothermal vents emanating serpentinized fluids. Here, we review the microbial ecology of marine and continental serpentinite-hosted biospheres in conjunction with a comparison of publicly available metagenomic sequence data from these communities to provide a global perspective of serpentinite ecology. Synthesis of observations across global systems reveal consistent themes in the diversity, ecology, and functioning of communities. Nevertheless, individual systems exhibit nuances due to local geology, hydrology, and input of oxidized, near-surface/seawater fluids. Further, several new (and old) questions remain including the provenance of carbon to support biomass synthesis, the physical and chemical limits of life in serpentinites, the mode and tempo of in situ evolution, and the extent to which modern serpentinites serve as analogs for those on early Earth. These topics are explored herein from a microbial perspective to outline key knowledge-gaps that should be a focus of future research.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Patients with IBD receive therapy to correct these imbalances and achieve remission. However, most patients relapse, suggesting that pathological mechanisms persist during remission. Here, we show that excess epithelial cell death is an underlying feature of IBD that arises in patients in remission and on advanced therapy. Mechanistically, nascent inflammation reprograms epithelial cells into a macrophage-like state that promotes RIPK1-independent necroptotic signaling, then triggers iNOS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis of absorptive epithelial cells and PUMA-mediated intestinal stem cell death. These findings reveal aberrant epithelial cell death signaling as a hallmark of IBD that occurs early in mucosal lesion development and persists despite current therapeutic approaches.

Understanding the cellular and molecular processes that occur during cardiac wound healing is an essential prerequisite to reducing health burden and improve cardiac function after myocardial tissue damage. By integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based spatial transcriptomics, we reconstructed the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fibrotic niche after ventricular injury in adult mice. Our analysis reveals dynamic regulation of local cell communication niches over time. We identified interactions that regulate cardiac repair, including fibroblast proliferation silencing by Trem2high macrophages that prevents excessive fibrosis. Moreover, we discovered a rare population of dedifferentiating cardiomyocytes during early post-lesion stages, which was sustained by signals from myeloid and lymphoid cells. Culturing non-regenerative mouse cardiomyocytes or human heart tissue with these niche factors reactivated progenitor gene expression and cell cycle activity. In summary, this spatio-temporal cell type atlas provides valuable insights into the heterocellular interactions that control cardiac repair.

While many bacteria also have linear chromosomes and plasmids, no transposons were known to target bacterial telomeres. Here we show several families of independently evolved telomeric transposons in cyanobacteria and Streptomyces. While these elements have one specific transposon end sequence with the second boundary being the telomere, we can show they move using two transposon ends. Telomeres are transiently bridged by the telomere maintenance systems, providing a duplex substrate for mobilization of the element and the associated telomere. We identify multiple instances where telomeric transposons have replaced native telomeres, making the host cell dependent on the new telomere system for genome maintenance. This work indicates how telomeric transposons can promote gene transfer both between and within genomes, significantly influencing the evolutionary dynamics of linear genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

MethodsRandomly selected individuals were invited to register and actively contacted to seek further information on the vaccines received and adverse events they experienced. Demographics of patients recruited, and summaries of reported data, are presented alongside detailed analyses of the sub-cohort of pregnant and breast-feeding patients and analyses conducted to support regulatory assessment of two safety signals, menstrual disorders, and tinnitus.

Results36,604 individuals registered, with 30,281 reporting vaccination. Median [IQR] follow-up was 184 days [14-367]. Demographics of the recruited cohort reflected the vaccinated population and timing of invitations. 15,764 (52.1%) of those reporting vaccination, reported experiencing at least one adverse reaction. However, nearly all were expected acute reactions and only 4,134 (13.7%) reported an event considered medically serious. The data raised no safety concerns in pregnant and breast-feeding patients. Reporting of menstrual disorders appeared stimulated by media interest, as seen in spontaneous reporting systems. Data on the incidence of tinnitus were used to support regulatory action on this signal.

DiscussionActive surveillance provided a complimentary data source for monitoring the safety of COVID- 19 vaccines. However, further efforts are needed to recruit ethnic minorities. The technology developed has enhanced regulatory vigilance options and could be valuable in the future for actively monitoring the safety of innovative products used in small populations.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

Since the release of the earliest model, the throughput and error rate of the platform have improved dramatically and it has become possible to consider sequencing and assembly of eukaryotic organisms using a single nanopore flow cell. Here, we present MinION sequence data, assembly and methylation analysis for the Columbia (Col-0) accession of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Further, we demonstrate the effect that recent developments (specifically the Q20+ chemistry and basecaller improvements) have had on read accuracy and assembly quality. Findings: DNA extracted from leaves of A. thaliana Col-0 was sequenced on two MinION flow cells, together amounting to 115x coverage of the 135 Mb genome. Reads were assembled and polished using several bioinformatics pipelines for nanopore sequence data. We performed CpG methylation analysis directly from the nanopore data, and this correlated well with a previously published bisulfite dataset. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a single MinION flow cell can generate sufficient data to assemble a genome of 135Mb, indicate functional elements, and unlock genomics for researchers of novel species from $600 in under 5 days. Here we release the full nanopore read sets for both flow cells, together with the nanopore-only assemblies. The data presented here is expected to be of particular interest to those in the Arabidopsis community, designing genome projects (with functional annotations), expanding our understanding of epigenetics across the tree of life, and for designing university or high school practicals teaching genomics and epigenomics.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Early-life disruptions in these circuits are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, highlighting the importance of understanding their development. Our study uncovers that transcription factors SOX4, SOX11, and TFAP2D play a pivotal role in the development, identity, and PFC connectivity of these neurons. Using mouse models, we demonstrate that the absence of transcription factors SOX4 and SOX11 in post-mitotic ExNs dramatically reduces the size of the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC), claustrum, and PIR. SOX4 and SOX11 control BLC formation through direct regulation of Tfap2d expression. Cross-species analyses, including humans, identified conserved Tfap2d expression in developing ExNs of BLC, claustrum, paleocortex including PIR, and the associated transitional areas of the frontal, insular and temporal cortex. While the loss and haploinsufficiency of Tfap2d yield similar alterations in learned threat behaviors, differences emerge in the manifestation of Tfap2d dosage, particularly in terms of changes observed in BLC size and the connectivity pattern between the BLC and PFC. This underscores the significance of Tfap2d dosage in orchestrating developmental shifts in BLC-PFC connectivity and behavioral modifications reminiscent of symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings reveal key elements of a conserved gene regulatory network that shapes the development and function of crucial ventropallial ExNs and their PFC connectivity and offer insights into their evolution and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

One of the most striking and well-known phenomena bearing on this question is inattentional blindness (IB; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Mack & Rock, 1998; Most et al., 2001, 2005). In IB, naive observers fail to report clearly visible stimuli when their attention is otherwise engaged--famously even missing a gorilla parading before their eyes (Simons & Chabris, 1999). This phenomenon and the research programs it has motivated carry tremendous theoretical significance, both as crucial evidence that awareness requires attention (Cohen et al., 2012; Prinz, 2012; Noah & Mangun, 2020) and as a key tool in seeking the neural correlates of consciousness (Rees et al., 1999; Pitts et al., 2014; Hutchinson, 2019). However, these and other implications critically rest on a notoriously biased measure: asking participants whether they noticed anything unusual (and interpreting negative answers as reflecting a complete lack of perception). Here, in the largest ever set of IB studies, we show that, as a group, inattentionally blind participants can successfully report the location, color and shape of the stimuli they deny noticing. This residual visual sensitivity shows that perceptual information remains accessible in IB. We further show that subjective reports in IB are conservative, by introducing absent trials where no IB stimulus is presented; this approach allows us to show for the first time that observers collectively show a systematic bias to report not noticing in IB--essentially  playing it safe in reporting their sensitivity. This pair of results is consistent with an alternative hypothesis about IB, namely that inattentionally blind subjects retain some degree of awareness of the stimuli they fail to report. Overall, these data provide the strongest evidence to date of significant residual visual sensitivity in IB. They also challenge the use of inattentional blindness to argue that awareness requires attention.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Motif scans therefore produce many false-positive binding site predictions. By surveying 179 TFs across 25 families using >1,500 cyclic in vitro selection experiments with fragmented, naked, and unmodified genomic DNA - a method we term GHT-SELEX (Genomic HT-SELEX) - we find that many human TFs possess much higher sequence specificity than anticipated. Moreover, genomic binding regions from GHT-SELEX are often surprisingly similar to those obtained in vivo (i.e. ChIP-seq peaks). We find that comparable specificity can also be obtained from motif scans, but performance is highly dependent on derivation and use of the motifs, including accounting for multiple local matches in the scans. We also observe alternative engagement of multiple DNA-binding domains within the same protein: long C2H2 zinc finger proteins often utilize modular DNA recognition, engaging different subsets of their DNA binding domain (DBD) arrays to recognize multiple types of distinct target sites, frequently evolving via internal duplication and divergence of one or more DBDs. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is common for TFs to possess sufficient intrinsic specificity to independently delineate cellular targets.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

Pre-pandemic seronegative healthy controls (ppHC, n = 32) and post-COVID recovered healthy controls (pcHC, n = 37) after SARS-CoV-2 infection were also included in the study.

We found persistent serum SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a subset of pcHC (11 %), PCS non-ME/CFS patients (2 %), and pcMECFS patients (14 %). There was no significant association with disease severity, symptoms, or laboratory markers. The spike protein concentration was independent of the time since last spike exposure (infection or vaccination). In five spike-positive out of a total of 22 patients who underwent immunoglobulin depletion via immunoadsorption (IA), spike protein was reduced or completely removed after treatment, indicating binding to immunoglobulins.

In summary, our study identified serum spike protein in a subset of patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection without evidence for a role in the pathogenesis of PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

Nearly 5,000 independent experiments across multiple in vitro and in vivo assays produced motifs for just over half of the putative TFs analyzed (177, or 53%), of which most are unique to a single TF. The data highlight the extensive contribution of transposable elements to TF evolution, both in cis and trans, and identify tens of thousands of conserved, base-level binding sites in the human genome. The use of multiple assays provides an unprecedented opportunity to benchmark and analyze TF sequence specificity, function, and evolution, as further explored in accompanying manuscripts. 1,421 human TFs are now associated with a DNA binding motif. Extrapolation from the Codebook benchmarking, however, suggests that many of the currently known binding motifs for well-studied TFs may inaccurately describe the TFs true sequence preferences.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

PSE feature densely packed elongated epithelial cells, with nuclei positioned along the apicobasal cell axis in a cell cycle-dependent manner. PSE serve as organ precursors in diverse developmental contexts across evolution. While the role of nuclear movements in PSE has been extensively studied, less is known about whether and how their nuclear packing arrangements and changes of packing state influence tissue morphogenesis. To address this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes and neighborhood statistics by segmenting nuclei in 3D and over development in zebrafish retinal neuroepithelia (RNE). We find that in PSE nuclei exhibit orientational, nematic-like order but remain positionally disordered. This pattern is conserved in other, less packed, neuroepithelia, like the hindbrain, suggesting that nematic-like order is a hallmark of pseudostratification. Our analysis during retinal development also revealed that nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical packing limits for disordered monodisperse ellipsoids at stages when the tissue transitions to a laminated neuronal structure. As neurogenesis progresses, nuclear shapes are remodeled, enabling the RNE to shift to a crystalline, ordered structure, while maintaining orientational alignment. Failure to initiate neurogenesis results in severe tissue deformations due to increased buckling instability. Our results thus show an instance where nuclear shape and nuclear positioning and their changes are essential for proper retinal morphogenesis, a phenomenon most likely also found in other tissue arrangements.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

First, the catalytic efficiencies achieved by such efforts have generally been quite low, and considerable optimization by directed evolution has been required to reach activities typical of native enzymes. Second, generative AI methods such as RFdiffusion now enable the direct generation of proteins around active sites, but to date, such scaffolding has required specification of both the position in the sequence and the backbone coordinates of the catalytic residue, which complicates sampling. Here we introduce a generative AI method called RFflow that overcomes these limitations and use it to design zinc metallohydrolases starting from a density functional theory description of active site geometry. Of 96 designs tested experimentally, the most active has a kcat/KM of 23,000 M-1 s-1, orders of magnitude higher than previously designed metallohydrolases. This 148 amino acid protein has a novel fold with an enclosed chamber which positions the reaction substrate nearly perfectly for attack by a catalytic water molecule activated by the bound metal and is predicted by ChemNet to have a highly preorganized active site. The ability to generate high activity catalysts starting from quantum chemistry calculated active site geometries without experimental optimization should open the door to a new generation of potent designer enzymes.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

The genome also encodes hundreds of putative and poorly characterized transcription factors (TFs). We determined genomic binding locations of 166 uncharacterized human TFs in living cells. Nearly half of them associated strongly with known regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers, often at conserved motif matches and co-localizing with each other. Surprisingly, the other half often associated with genomic dark matter, at largely unique sites, via intrinsic sequence recognition. Dozens of these, which we term ""Dark TFs"", mainly bind within regions of closed chromatin. Dark TF binding sites are enriched for transposable elements, and are rarely under purifying selection. Some Dark TFs are KZNFs, which contain the repressive KRAB domain, but many are not: the Dark TFs also include known or potential pioneer TFs. Compiled literature information supports that the Dark TFs exert diverse functions ranging from early development to tumor suppression. Thus, our results sheds light on a large fraction of previously uncharacterized human TFs and their unappreciated activities within the dark matter genome.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 decreases oligodendrocyte density, indicating that procaspase-3 upregulation promotes differentiation. Moreover, using procaspase-3 as a marker, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation continues in the aging cortex and white matter.

Any particular motif model has potential flaws due to shortcomings of the underlying experimental data and computational motif discovery algorithm. As a part of the Codebook/GRECO-BIT initiative, here we evaluated at large scale the cross-platform recognition performance of positional weight matrices (PWMs), which remain popular motif models in many practical applications. We applied ten different DNA motif discovery tools to generate PWMs from the ""Codebook"" data comprised of 4,237 experiments from five different platforms profiling the DNA-binding specificity of 394 human proteins, focusing on understudied transcription factors of different structural families. For many of the proteins, there was no prior knowledge of a genuine motif. By benchmarking-supported human curation, we constructed an approved subset of experiments comprising about 30% of all experiments and 50% of tested TFs which displayed consistent motifs across platforms and replicates. We present the Codebook Motif Explorer (https://mex.autosome.org), a detailed online catalog of DNA motifs, including the top-ranked PWMs, and the underlying source and benchmarking data. We demonstrate that in the case of high-quality experimental data, most of the popular motif discovery tools detect valid motifs and generate PWMs, which perform well both on genomic and synthetic data. Yet, for each of the algorithms, there were problematic combinations of proteins and platforms, and the basic motif properties such as nucleotide composition and information content offered little help in detecting such pitfalls. By combining multiple PMWs in decision trees, we demonstrate how our setup can be readily adapted to train and test binding specificity models more complex than PWMs. Overall, our study provides a rich motif catalog as a solid baseline for advanced models and highlights the power of the multi-platform multi-tool approach for reliable mapping of DNA binding specificities.

Each step of this complex process has received extensive attention in the literature, and has been significantly streamlined over the years. Given the volume of publicly available genetic data, obtaining genomes for a wide selection of known species is straightforward. However, analyzing that same data in order to generate a phylogenetic tree is a multi-step process with legitimate scientific and technical challenges, and often requires a significant input from a domain-area scientist. Results: We present Poplar, a new, streamlined computational pipeline, to address the computational logistical issues that arise when constructing phylogenetic trees. It provides a framework that runs stateof-the-art software for essential steps in the phylogenetic pipeline, beginning from a genome with or without an annotation, and resulting in a species tree. Running Poplar requires no external databases. In the execution, it enables parallelism for execution for clusters and cloud computing. The trees generated by Poplar match closely with state-of-the-art published trees. The usage and performance of Poplar is far simpler and quicker than manually running a phylogenetic pipeline.

Here, we characterize how hunger restructures an animals spontaneous behavior as well as its directed exploration of a novel object. We show that hunger-induced changes in exploration are accompanied by and result from modulation of dopamine signaling in the tail of the striatum (TOS). Dopamine signaling in the TOS is modulated by internal hunger state through the activity of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, putative ""hunger neurons"" in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These AgRP neurons are poly-synaptically connected to TOS-projecting dopaminergic neurons through the lateral hypothalamus, the central amygdala, and the periaqueductal grey. We thus delineate a hypothalamic-midbrain circuit that coordinates changes in exploration behavior in the hungry state.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

To expedite the design process, mathematical modelling is typically employed to predict circuit function in silico ahead of implementation, which when coupled with computational optimization can be used to automatically identify promising designs. However, circuit models are inherently inaccurate which can result in sub-optimal or non-functional in vivo performance. To mitigate this issue, here we propose to combine Bayesian inference, Thompson sampling, and risk management to find optimal circuit designs. Our approach employs data from non-functional designs to estimate the distribution of the model parameters and then employs risk-averse optimization to select design parameters that are expected to perform well given parameter uncertainty and biomolecular noise. We illustrate the approach by designing robust adaptation circuits and genetic oscillators with a prescribed frequency. The proposed approach provides a novel methodology for the design of robust genetic circuitry.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

We generated two types of textual descriptions for images of famous people and places: visual-text, describing the visual content of the image, and abstract-text, based on their Wikipedia definitions, and extracted their relational-structure representations from a large language model.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of respiratory system disorders before and after the pandemic onset in individuals with and without PASC.

MethodsWe designed a case-control study was designed to investigate the prevalence of respiratory system-related diagnoses in adult, non-hospitalized PASC patients (cases) in 2019, 12 months before and 6 months after the PASC diagnosis compared to matched controls without PASC. Data was extracted from the Stockholm Regions database warehouse (VAL).

ResultsHigher diagnostic rates for common respiratory illnesses were observed among PASC patients in 2019 and 12 months before PASC diagnosis, which then slightly decreased 6 months after PASC diagnosis. PASC patients showed more pre-pandemic respiratory diagnoses compared to controls: in 2019 they had higher incidence of acute upper respiratory tract infection (OR 2.47 for males, 2.22 for females), asthma (OR 1.76 (males), 1.95 (females)), and bronchitis (OR 2.15 (males), 2.71 (females)) compared to controls.

ConclusionsThis study highlights that individuals with PASC have a higher prevalence of respiratory disorders both before and after their COVID-19 diagnosis. Notably, asthma and other respiratory conditions were more common in PASC patients compared to matched controls. Our study demonstrates that individuals with asthma are more likely to develop PASC, even if asthma does not increase the severity of acute COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms connecting respiratory illnesses and PASC. Understanding the long-term consequences of COVID-19 in individuals with pre-existing conditions will be crucial for refining clinical management strategies and improving patients outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

However, whilst Rab25 vesicles distribute to the leading of edge of moving cells, how directly they contribute to cell protrusion is not clear. Here we adopt a magnetogenetic approach that allows direct manipulation of Rab25 positioning to show that localisation to the cell periphery drives the formation of F-actin protrusions.

The use of sequence similarity networks (SSNs) is a standard method for exploring large sequence datasets, but is currently limited when scaling to very large datasets and when viewing more than one level (hierarchy) of homology. Here, we present a sequence analysis pipeline with a number of innovations that address some limitations of traditional SSNs. First, we develop a hierarchical visualization approach that captures the full range of homologies across protein superfamilies. Second, we leverage representations embedded by protein language models as an alternative homology metric to the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), showing that they produce comparable results when identifying isofunctional protein families. Finally, we demonstrate that unbiased representative sampling of sequences from genetic neighborhoods can be achieved through the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs) or vector representations. The utility of these methods is exemplified by updating the sequence-function analysis of the FMN/F420-binding split barrel superfamily and improving phylogenetic analyses. We provide our sequence exploration pipeline as publicly available code (ProteinClusterTools) and show it to be scalable to large datasets (~300k sequences) using desktop computers.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Here we explored whether KANSL1 functions at the cilium, a microtubule-rich organelle critical for brain development, neuronal excitability, and sensory integration. Leveraging the Xenopus model, we found that Kansl1 is highly expressed in developing ciliated tissues and localizes within motile cilia. Moreover, Kansl1 depletion caused ciliogenesis defects that could be partially rescued by human KANSL1. Based on these findings, we explored the prevalence of cilia-related clinical features including structural heart defects, hypogonadism, and structural respiratory defects among 99 individuals with KdVS, ages 1 month to 37 years old. To directly test if KdVS causes ciliary dysfunction in humans, we measured the well-established ciliary functional biomarker, nasal nitric oxide, in 11 affected individuals and observed a significant decrease when compared to unaffected family members. Together, this work establishes a ciliary contribution of KANSL1 mutations to KdVS. This work adds to a growing literature highlighting the relevance of the cilium to neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly to those impacting sociability. Going forward, KANSL1 provides a unique opportunity to study a monogenic mechanism of hypersociability that may be useful in elaborating the molecular underpinnings of social behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Following a bloodmeal, mosquitoes experience significant physiological changes, primarily orchestrated by the midgut and fat body tissues. These changes begin with digestion and culminate in egg production. However, our understanding of those key processes at the cellular and molecular level remains limited. We have created a comprehensive cell atlas of the mosquito midgut and fat body by employing single-cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics techniques. This atlas unveils the dynamic cellular composition and metabolic adaptations that occur following a bloodmeal. Our analyses reveal highly diverse cell populations, specialized in digestion, metabolism, immunity, and reproduction. While the midgut primarily comprises enterocytes, enteroendocrine and intestinal stem cells, the fat body consists not only of trophocytes and oenocytes, but also harbors a substantial hemocyte population and a newly found fat body-yolk cell population. The fat body exhibits a complex cellular and metabolomic profile and exerts a central role in coordinating immune and metabolic processes. Additionally, an insect-specific virus, PCLV (Phasi Charoen-Like Virus) was detected in single cells, mainly in the midgut a week after the bloodmeal. These findings highlight the complexity of the mosquitos abdominal tissues, and pave the way towards the development of exquisitely refined vector control strategies consisting of genetically targeting specific cell populations and metabolic pathways necessary for egg development after a bloodmeal.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Here, we present non-destructive transcriptomics by vesicular export (NTVE) to enable multi-time-point monitoring of RNA expression dynamics in living inducible reporter cell lines. Stabilized RNA reporter barcodes can be selectively packaged and exported from cells via virus-like particles (VLPs) containing selective affinity handles for convenient multichannel tracking of co-cultured cells. Using an engineered RNA adapter, NTVE exports cellular transcripts from inducible human and murine reporter cell lines with high concordance to conventional lysate-derived RNA-seq. NTVE allows monitoring of transcriptome changes in response to genetic and chemical perturbations in the same cells over time using standard sequencing workflows. NTVE can also be equipped with fusogens to deliver mRNA-encoded effectors or ribonucleoprotein gene editors from sender cells to activate gene reporters in co-cultured recipient cells. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of NTVE in monitoring hiPSC differentiation through daily NTVE analysis tracking multiple lineage-specific marker genes.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient is more accurate and is up to 50x faster than current state-of-the-art. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metients reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in many patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and further finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported. By removing the need for hard constraints on what patterns of metastatic spread are most likely, Metient introduces a way to further our understanding of cancer type-specific metastatic spread.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

This dark-specific process, known as skotomorphogenesis, relies primarily on mitochondria and eventually etioplasts for energy. Our previous research shows that skotomorphogenesis is reprogrammed in response to mitochondrial and plastidial dysfunction. Even though the direct link between mitochondria and skotomorphogenesis was described, the impact of plastid dysfunction on early development could not be separated from mitochondrial stress. In this study, we aim to determine the direct connection between plastid functionality and skotomorphogenic response. In this situation, we analyze the phenotypic, molecular, and metabolic effects of treating etiolated seedlings using lincomycin and spectinomycin, which target plastid translation. Our results with the lincomycin treatment highlight the direct role of plastids in the control of early development, even in dark growth conditions, in the absence of any photosynthetic activity, and without the involvement of mitochondrial intermediates. Additionally, our findings suggest that GUN1 plays a regulatory role in regulating nuclear gene expression in response to plastid translation inhibition. Thanks to our study, we can now build a more precise model proposing a straight link between the reprogramming of early development and the dysfunction of plastids in dark-growth conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Numerous computational models on the EC propose that its grid cells serve as a spatial metric, supporting path integration and efficient generalization. However, little is known about how these cells could contribute to episodic memory, which emphasizes episode-specific representations that align with pattern separation. Taking into consideration anatomical specifications of EC inputs to the HPC and computational principles underlying the EC-HPC memory system, we argue that EC layer IIa (EC2a) supports pattern separation and EC layer IIb/III (EC2b/3) supports generalization. Utilizing recurrent inhibition and the nature of single EC2a neurons binding converging inputs from the neocortex (i.e., conjunctive coding), we built a biologically-based neural network model of the EC-HPC system for episodic memory. By examining how EC2a transformed its cortical inputs and output them to the trisynaptic pathway (EC2a - Dentate Gyrus - CA3 - CA1), we found that instead of systematically generalizing across similar inputs, recurrent inhibition and conjunctive coding in EC2a neurons support strong pattern separation and increase mnemonic discrimination. Furthermore, lesioning EC2a neurons in the model resembled memory impairments found in people with Alzheimer's Disease, suggesting an intertwined relationship between memory and the majority of pure grid cells in the EC. On the other hand, the topographically organized monosynaptic pathway (EC2b/3 - CA1) is computationally more suitable for efficient factorization and generalization. This model provides novel anatomically-based predictions regarding the computational roles of EC cells in pattern separation and generalization, which together form a critical computational framework for both episodic memory and spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

The T22N mutation, similar to the DelS31 mutation in KP.3.1.1, introduces a potential N-linked glycosylation site in XEC. In this study, we examined the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response and mutation effects in sera from bivalent-vaccinated healthcare workers, BA.2.86/JN.1 wave-infected patients, and XBB.1.5 monovalent-vaccinated hamsters, assessing responses to XEC alongside D614G, JN.1, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. XEC demonstrated significantly reduced neutralization titers across all cohorts, largely due to the F59S mutation. Notably, removal of glycosylation sites in XEC and KP.3.1.1 substantially restored nAb titers. Antigenic cartography analysis revealed XEC to be more antigenically distinct from its common ancestral BA.2.86/JN.1 compared to KP.3.1.1, with the F59S mutation as a determining factor. Similar to KP.3.1.1, XEC showed reduced cell-cell fusion relative to its parental KP.3, a change attributed to the T22N glycosylation. We also observed reduced S1 shedding for XEC and KP.3.1.1, which was reversed by ablation of T22N and DelS31 glycosylation mutations, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that T22N and F59S mutations of XEC alters hydrophobic interactions with adjacent spike protein residues, impacting both conformational stability and neutralization. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of NTD mutations in shaping SARS-CoV-2 spike biology and immune escape mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Building on this framework, our study introduces a novel approach to understanding schizophrenia and exploring potential ways to adjust neural activity through synaptic restoration. Using a combination of magnetoencephalography data and dynamic causal modeling, we identified specific synaptic disturbances in schizophrenia patients, including increased NMDA receptor-mediated excitation in superficial pyramidal neurons and reduced GABA-B receptor-mediated inhibition between interneurons and pyramidal cells. These findings reveal a critical imbalance in excitation and inhibition within thalamo-cortical circuits, manifesting as altered gamma and alpha oscillations. The cornerstone of our research is an in silico synaptic restoration analysis, which demonstrates that targeted modifications to AMPA, NMDA, GABA-A, and GABA-B receptor-mediated connections can recalibrate altered neural activity in schizophrenia, aligning it with healthy control patterns. This restoration approach not only highlights the complex nature of synaptic dysfunction in the disorder but also identifies specific pathways as potential therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for investigating schizophrenia's diverse symptomatology.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

This release includes 530 high-quality pooled libraries from flies collected across six continents over more than a decade (2009-2021), most at multiple time points per year; 211 of these libraries are sequenced and shared here for the first time. We used this enhanced resource to elucidate several aspects of the species demographic history and identify novel signs of adaptation across spatial and temporal dimensions. We showed that patterns of secondary contact, originally characterized in North America, are replicated in South America and Australia. We also found that the spatial genetic structure of populations is stable over time, but that drift due to seasonal contractions of population size causes populations to diverge over time. We identified signals of adaptation that vary between continents in genomic regions associated with xenobiotic resistance, consistent with independent adaptation to common pesticides. Moreover, by analyzing samples collected during spring and fall across Europe, we provide new evidence for seasonal adaptation related to loci associated with pathogen response.

Here, we performed paired single nucleus gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiling from 44 human coronary arteries. To link disease variants to molecular traits, we developed a meta-map of 88 samples and discovered 11,182 single-cell chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs). Heritability enrichment analysis and disease variant mapping demonstrated that smooth muscle cells (SMCs) harbor the greatest genetic risk for CAD. To capture the continuum of SMC cell states in disease, we used dynamic single cell caQTL modeling for the first time in tissue to uncover QTLs whose effects are modified by cell state and expand our insight into genetic regulation of heterogenous cell populations. Notably, we identified a variant in the COL4A1/COL4A2 CAD GWAS locus which becomes a caQTL as SMCs de-differentiate by changing a transcription factor binding site for EGR1/2. To unbiasedly prioritize functional candidate genes, we built a genome-wide single cell variant to enhancer to gene (scV2E2G) map for human CAD to link disease variants to causal genes in cell types.

Next, we performed genome-wide Hi-C in 16 human coronary arteries to build tissue specific maps of chromatin conformation and link disease variants to integrated chromatin hubs and distal target genes. Using this approach, we show that rs4887091 within the ADAMTS7 CAD GWAS locus modulates function of a super chromatin interactome through a change in a CTCF binding site. Finally, we used CRISPR interference to validate a distal gene, AMOTL2, liked to a CAD GWAS locus. Collectively we provide a disease-agnostic framework to translate human genetic findings to identify pathologic cell states and genes driving disease, producing a comprehensive scV2E2G map with genetic and tissue level convergence for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

While each omics profile assists characterization of specific molecular components relevant for the studied phenotype, their joint evaluation can offer deeper insights into the overall mechanistic functioning of biological systems. Here, we introduce an approach where starting from representative traits (e.g., differentially expressed elements) obtained for each omics profile, we construct and analyze joint interaction networks. The resulting networks rely on the existing knowledge of confident interactions among biological entities. We use these maps to identify and describe central elements, which connect multiple entities characteristic for the studied phenotypes and we leverage MONET network decomposition tool in order to highlight functionally connected network modules. In order to enable broad usage of this approach, we developed the NOODAI software platform, which enables integrative omics analysis through a user-friendly interface. The analysis outcomes are presented both as raw output tables as well as high-quality summary plots and written reports. Since the MONET tool enables the use of algorithms with strong performance in identifying disease-relevant modules, the NOODAI software platform can be of a high value for the analysis of clinical multi-omics datasets.

By utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1{beta} activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus prevents syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirms that IL-1{beta} significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spreading in the lung epithelia. Together, by revealing the function and underlying mechanism of IL-1{beta} on SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion, our study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

However, a crucial phase for early organogenesis between E9.5 and E11.5 was deficient. To unveil the mystery of this stage, we present the 3D transcriptomics of mouse embryos at E9.5 and E11.5, with a widely applicable reconstruction workflow that bypasses sophisticated bioinformatic calculations.

More specifically, we found adult C57BL/6J mice developed neurological impairments, including behavior changes related to sensorimotor coordination, depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, and inflammation in multiple organs including lung, liver and brain, which persisted over at least 4 weeks in mice even with mild infection. Therefore, this model can be used to further explopred the mechanisms of PASC, as well as potential intervention or therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Genetic loss of either LUBAC or OTULIN causes autoinflammatory syndromes, which are associated with defects in glycogen and lipid metabolism. However, how LUBAC and OTULIN regulate metabolic signalling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LUBAC promotes, while OTULIN restricts, activation of the key metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cells, mice, and human samples. LUBAC and OTULIN interact with AMPK, control its M1-ubiquitination, and regulate its activation in response to glucose starvation and allosteric activation. During starvation, LUBAC deficiency impairs autophagy induction and hinders the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Strikingly, LUBAC-deficient Drosophila have a strongly reduced survival rate after starvation. Our work identifies LUBAC and OTULIN as physiological regulators of AMPK, providing the first mechanism by which M1-linked ubiquitin chains regulate metabolic signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

By focusing experimental efforts on the most promising candidates guided by deep learning predictions, antibodies with optimal properties can be designed more quickly and effectively.

Here, we developed an efficient protocol to generate pure populations of morphologically distinct human astrocytes in vitro, which we used for a systematic analysis of shape-function relationships. We performed a structural, molecular, and functional characterization of these populations and highlighted how their distinct morphologies mirror distinct functional and transcriptional patterns at the population level. We were also able to both correlate gene expression profiles of these morphologically distinct astrocyte subtypes with in vivo astrocytes in the human brain, and to validate our findings with primary isolated murine astrocytes in vitro. Moreover, we show that the observed morphological differences are correlated with changes in key cytoskeletal proteins, which offers a potential link to the observed functional differences. Finally, we demonstrated that different morphological subtypes of astrocytes have distinct reactivity responses to a common stimulus. This study offers a glimpse into the shape-function dynamics of human astrocytes, highlighting potential mechanistic links between cytoskeletal usage and astrocyte function, while also providing tools and datasets that will be useful for further studies into human glial biology in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Here, we present evidence indicating that COPII-mediated vesicle transport is transcriptionally controlled through the phosphatidic acid-dependent Opi1-Ino2/Ino4 regulatory circuit. Our analysis indicates that YIP3, a target gene of Ino2/Ino4, exerts a negative regulatory impact on COPII-mediated vesicle transport. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ino2/Ino4 but not Yip3 modulates Sar1 activation, the initial step in COPII vesicle formation, whereas Yip3 hinders Sec16 assembly on the ER membrane, thereby implying that Ino2/Ino4 governs COPII-mediated trafficking at multiple steps.

Neutralisation assays showed reduced activity against delta and omicron BA.1, BA.5 and BA.5 VOCs. However, the differences were in general less pronounced than in the ELISA assay and some were not statistically significant, particularly after four (two AZ and two PZ) vaccinations. We also generated by circular polymerase extension reaction an attenuated SARS-CoV-2 strain with deletion of all accessory genes, ORF 3, 6, 7 and 8, based on the ancestral (QLD02) virus backbone (QLD02{Delta}3678) and validated it in virus-neutralization assays with our panel of sera samples. We showed the attenuation of the QLD02{Delta}3678 virus in Vero E6 and human Caco2 cells. We demonstrated that neutralization assays with the wild-type QLD02 virus and QLD02{Delta}3678 virus were concordant, providing a safe platform for neutralisation assays in BSL2/PC2 settings.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Few pharmacological agents have been investigated for the treatment of frailty. In Ayurveda, Ashwagandha (Withania Somnifera) is a popular botanical medicine used for improvement in physical strength and mental stress and has a potential for treatment of frailty. This placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and safety of a capsule containing 300mg of Ashwagandha Root Extract (ARE) administered twice daily orally for 8 weeks. Fifty elderly subjects with a frailty score [&ge;]7 based on Frailty Assessment and Screening Tool (FAST) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Ashwagandha (ARE, n=25) or placebo (PL, n=25). Improvement in frailty after 8 weeks was assessed by FAST, 6-minute Walk Test (6MWT), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Short Form Survey (SF-12) scores. Blood samples were collected at baseline and week 8 for estimation of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), cortisol and Creatinine Kinase (CK). Significant improvement (p<0.01) in scores for FAST, 6MWTs, PSQI, MMSE, and SF-12 were seen with ARE after 8 weeks. Also, significant improvements (p<0.05) were observed in CK and in CRP with ARE. These improvements were greater (p<0.05) with ARE as compared to placebo. ARE was well tolerated with no adverse effects, and no changes in hepatic and renal parameters. Thus, Ashwagandha root extract can be a valuable therapeutic option for improvement of health condition in frailty.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580290

Efforts at modeling this complex many-to-many mapping have been greatly impeded by a severe lack of experimental data. To address this, we present TCR-TRANSLATE, a novel framework that adapts low-resource machine translation techniques to the TCR:pMHC specificity domain. Here, we explore sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling with various training strategies, including semi-synthetic data augmentation and multi-task objectives to generate antigen specific TCR sequences for a given target of interest. We benchmark twelve model variants derived from the BART and T5 model architectures on a target-rich validation set of well-studied pMHCs, finding an optimal model, TCRT5, that generated validated antigen-specific CDR3{beta} sequences for previously unseen antigens. While current limitations include a narrow validation set and a focus on the CDR3{beta} loop, our approach demonstrates the potential of seq2seq models in rapidly generating antigen-specific TCR repertoires, offering a promising avenue for increasing throughput in precision immunotherapies. Our findings highlight both the capabilities and limitations of sequence-based conditional TCR design, emphasizing the need for experimental validation to bridge the gaps between predictions, metrics, and functional capacity.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

However, it has also been suggested that innate immune responses may be triggered by viral transcription. In this study, we investigated whether an immunostimulatory RNA is produced during IAV transcription. We show that the IAV RNA polymerase can read though the polyadenylation signal during transcription termination, generating a capped complementary RNA (ccRNA), which contains the 5 cap of an IAV mRNA and the 3 terminus of a cRNA instead of a poly(A) tail. ccRNAs are detectable in vitro and in both ribonucleoprotein reconstitution assays and IAV infections. Mutations that disrupt polyadenylation enhance ccRNA synthesis and increase RIG-I-dependent innate immune activation. Notably, while ccRNA itself is not immunostimulatory, it forms a RIG-I agonist by hybridizing with a complementary negative-sense viral RNA. These findings thus identify a novel non-canonical IAV RNA species and suggest an alternative mechanism for RIG-I activation during IAV infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

Protein-peptide docking has become essential for predicting complex structures. AlphaFold-Multimer, ColabFold and AlphaFold3 provided groundbreaking tools to enhance the protein-peptide docking accuracy. This study evaluates these three tools for predicting protein-peptide complex structures using Template-Based (TB) and Template-Free (TF) methods. AlphaFold-Multimer excels in TB predictions and performs moderately in TF scenarios in the prediction pool, but TF outperforms TB in the first-ranked models. ColabFold demonstrates versatility in both TB and TF settings. AlphaFold3 generates high-quality structures for more proteins, but the medium accuracy is not as good as AlphaFold-Multimer using a large model pool. We also assessed the performance of various scoring functions in ranking predicted protein-peptide complex structures. While the scoring function built in AlphaFold demonstrates the best performance, some other scoring functions, e.g., FoldX-Stability and HADDOCK-mdscore, provide complementary values. The findings suggest the potential for enhancing scoring functions targeting AlphaFold-based predictions by combining multiple scoring functions or using a consensus approach from many prediction models.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580290

In addition, any analysis should be fully reproducible and the workflow must be publicly available to allow other researchers to understand the reasoning behind computed results. Here, we introduce the Metagenomics-Toolkit, a scalable, data agnostic workflow that automates the analysis of short and long metagenomic reads obtained from Illumina or Oxford Nanopore Technology devices, respectively. The Metagenomics-Toolkit offers not only standard features expected in a metagenome workflow, such as quality control, assembly, binning, and annotation, but also distinctive features, such as plasmid identification based on various tools, the recovery of unassembled microbial community members and the discovery of microbial interdependencies through a combination of dereplication, co-occurrence, and genome-scale metabolic modeling. Furthermore, the Metagenomics-Toolkit includes a machine learning-optimized assembly step that tailors the peak RAM value requested by a metagenome assembler to match actual requirements, thereby minimizing the dependency on dedicated high-memory hardware. While the Metagenomics-Toolkit can be executed on user workstations, it also offers several optimizations for an efficient cloud-based cluster execution. We compare the Metagenomics-Toolkit to five commonly used metagenomics workflows and demonstrate the capabilities of the Metagenomics-Toolkit by executing it on 757 metagenome datasets from sewage samples for an investigation of a possible sewage core microbiome.

However, the relatively low representation of admixed populations in both discovery and fine-tuning individual-level datasets limits PRS development for admixed populations. Under the assumption that the most informative PRS weight for a homogeneous sample, which can be approximated by a data point in the ancestry continuum space, varies linearly in that space, we introduce a Genetic Distance-assisted PRS Combination Pipeline for Diverse Genetic Ancestries (DiscoDivas) to interpolate a harmonized PRS for diverse, especially admixed, ancestries, leveraging multiple PRS weights fine-tuned within single-ancestry samples and the genetic ancestry continuum information. DiscoDivas treats ancestry as a continuous variable and does not require shifting between different models when calculating PRS for different ancestries. We generated PRS with DiscoDivas and the current conventional method, i.e. fine-tuning multiple GWAS PRS using the matched or similar ancestry sample, for simulated datasets and large-scale biobank datasets (UK Biobank [UKBB] N=415,402, Mass General Brigham Biobank N=53,306, All of Us N=245,394) and compared our method with the conventional method with quantitative traits and complex disease traits. DiscoDivas generated a harmonized PRS of the accuracy comparable to or higher than the conventional approach, with the greatest advantage exhibited in admixed samples: DiscoDivas PRS for admixed samples was more statistically accurate than the PRS fine-tuned in matched or similar ancestry sample in 12 out of 16 simulated scenarios and was statistically equivalent in the remaining four scenarios; when tested with quantitative trait data in UKBB, DiscoDivas increased the PRS accuracy of admixed sample by 5% on average; yet no statistical difference was observed when tested for binary traits in UKBB where ancestry-matched data was available. For the single ancestry samples, the accuracy of DiscoDivas PRS and PRS fine-tuned in match samples was similar. In summary, our method DiscoDivas yields a harmonized PRS of robust accuracy for individuals across the genetic ancestry spectrum, including where ancestry-matched training data may be incomplete.","NA","medrxiv",1731708580291

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently.

Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291

Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.

One Sentence SummarySingle neurons in human temporal cortex use feature axes to encode objects, and imagery reactivates this code.","NA","biorxiv",1731708580291
