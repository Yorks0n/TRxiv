Nanopore sequencing has long held the promise for such progress, but has had limited market penetration. This is because efficient and accurate nanopore sequencing of nucleic acids has been challenged by fundamental signal-to-noise limitations resulting from the poor spatial resolution and molecular distinction of nucleobases. Here, we describe Sequencing by Expansion (SBX), a single-molecule sequencing technology that overcomes these limitations by using a biochemical conversion process to encode the sequence of a target nucleic acid molecule into an Xpandomer, a highly measurable surrogate polymer. Expanding over 50 times longer than the parent DNA templates, Xpandomers are engineered with high signal-to-noise reporter codes to enable facile, high-accuracy nanopore sequencing. We demonstrate the performance of SBX and present the specialized molecular structures, chemistries, enzymes and methods that enable it. The innovative molecular and systems engineering in SBX create a transformative technology to address the needs of existing and emerging sequencing applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

We previously discovered that human TB granulomas are enriched for immunosuppressive factors typically associated with tumor-immune evasion, raising the intriguing possibility that they promote tolerance to infection. In this study, our goal was to identify the prime drivers for establishing this tolerogenic niche and to determine if the magnitude of this response correlates with bacterial persistence. To do this, we conducted a multimodal spatial analysis of 52 granulomas from 16 non-human primates (NHP) who were infected with low dose Mtb for 9-12 weeks. Notably, each granuloma's bacterial burden was individually quantified allowing us to directly ask how granuloma spatial structure and function relate to infection control. We found that a universal feature of TB granulomas was partitioning of the myeloid core into two distinct metabolic environments, one of which is hypoxic. This hypoxic environment associated with pathologic immune cell states, dysfunctional cellular organization of the granuloma, and a near-complete blockade of lymphocyte infiltration that would be required for a successful host response. The extent of these hypoxia-associated features correlated with worsened bacterial burden. We conclude that hypoxia governs immune cell state and organization within granulomas and is a potent driver of subverted immunity during TB.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Here we present structural convergent evolution on fusion enzymes of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). We discovered BdhE (bifunctional dehydrogenase E), an enzyme clade that emerged independently from the previously known AdhE family through distinct gene fusion events. AdhE and BdhE showed shared enzymatic activities and non-overlapping phylogenetic distribution, suggesting common functions in different species. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed BdhEs form donut-like homotetramers, contrasting AdhE's helical homopolymers. Intriguingly, despite distinct quaternary structures and >70% unshared amino acids, both enzymes form resembled dimeric structure units by ALDH-ADH interactions via convergently elongated loop structures.

Here, we present structures of the midnolin-proteasome complex, revealing how established proteasomal components are repurposed to enable a unique form of proteolysis. While the proteasomal subunit PSMD2/Rpn1 binds to ubiquitinated or ubiquitin-like proteins, we discover that it also interacts with the midnolin nuclear localization sequence, elucidating how midnolins activity is confined to the nucleus. Likewise, PSMD14/Rpn11, an enzyme that normally cleaves ubiquitin chains, surprisingly functions non-enzymatically as a receptor for the midnolin ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain, positioning the substrate-binding Catch domain directly above the proteasomal entry site to guide substrates into the proteasome. Moreover, we demonstrate that midnolin downregulation is critical for the survival of myeloma cells by promoting the expression of its transcription factor substrate IRF4. Our findings uncover the mechanisms underlying the midnolin-proteasome pathway and midnolin downregulation as a driver of multiple myeloma.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

In this study, we identified a subset of microglia distributed in close proximity to the ependymal wall of ventricles. They differed from parenchymal microglia in morphology, behaviors and transcriptomes. In particular, the paraventricular microglia extended transependymal dendrites into the lumen of ventricles and were proficient in sequestering and phagocytosing intraventricular exogenous particles when present. A specific removal of the paraventricular microglia led to an acute ventriculomegaly due to an increased colloid osmotic pressure in the CSF resulting from protein accumulation. Thus, we identified the paraventricular microglia as specific guardians in monitoring and cleaning the CSF.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

P. aeruginosa is known to be dominant, often compromising S. aureus through the secretion of inhibitory compounds. We previously demonstrated that S. aureus can become resistant to growth-inhibitory compounds during experimental evolution. While resistance arose rapidly, the underlying mechanisms were not obvious as only a few genetic mutations were associated with resistance, while ample phenotypic changes occurred. We thus hypothesize that resistance may result from a combination of phenotypic responses and genetic adaptation. Here, we tested this hypothesis using proteomics. We first focused on an evolved strain that acquired a single mutation in tcyA (encoding a transmembrane transporter unit) upon exposure to P. aeruginosa supernatant. We show that this mutation leads to a complete abolishment of transporter synthesis, which confers moderate protection against PQS and selenocystine, two toxic compounds produced by P. aeruginosa. However, this genetic effect was minor compared to the fundamental phenotypic changes observed at the proteome level when both ancestral and evolved S. aureus strains were exposed to P. aeruginosa supernatant. Major changes involved the downregulation of virulence factors, metabolic pathways, membrane transporters, and the upregulation of ROS scavengers and an efflux pump. Our results suggest that the observed multi-variate phenotypic response is a powerful adaptive strategy, offering instant protection against competitors in fluctuating environments and reducing the need for hard-wired genetic adaptations.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Score Test (GST) in the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GST with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the GEEs with the robust Wald test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GST demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed that the GST-identified differentially expressed genes were enriched in pathways directly implicated in cancer progression. In contrast, the Wilcoxon test- identified genes were enriched in non-cancer pathways and produced substantial false positives, highlighting its limitations for spatially structured data. Our findings suggest that the GST approach is well-suited for ST data, offering more accurate identification of biologically relevant gene expression changes.

Current treatments often fail to provide sustained relief, highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms driving discogenic LBP. During disc degeneration, the extracellular matrix degrades, allowing nociceptive nerve fibers to innervate previously aneural disc regions. Persistent mechanical and inflammatory stimulation of nociceptors can induce plastic changes within dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, characterized by altered gene expression, enhanced excitability, and lowered activation thresholds. Although these transcriptional changes have been described in other pain states, including osteoarthritis, they remain underexplored in discogenic LBP. To address this gap, this study represents the first application of comprehensive single-nuclei RNA sequencing of DRG neurons in a rat model of chronic discogenic LBP. Eighteen distinct DRG subpopulations were identified and mapped to existing mouse and cross-species atlases revealing strong similarities in neuronal populations with the mouse. Differential expression analysis revealed increased expression of pain-associated genes, including Scn9a and Piezo2, and neuroinflammatory mediators such as Fstl1 and Ngfr, in LBP animals. Axial hypersensitivity, measured using grip strength, significantly correlated with increased expression of Scn9a, Fstl1, and Ngfr, which suggests their role in maintaining axial hypersensitivity in this model. These findings establish a relationship between DRG transcriptomic changes and axial hypersensitivity in a discogenic LBP model, identifying potential molecular targets for non-opioid treatments and advancing understanding of discogenic LBP mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

However, it has largely been developed using data from individuals of White ethnicity.

MethodsWe utilised data from multiple sources to derive estimates for the distributions of risk factors and their effect sizes in major UK ethnic groups (White, Black, South Asian, East Asian, and Mixed). We combined these with ethnicity-specific population cancer incidences to update BOADICEA so that it provides ethnicity-specific risk estimates. We also developed and included a method for deriving adjusted polygenic scores for individuals of mixed genetic ancestry.

ResultsThe predicted average absolute risks were smaller in all non-White ethnic groups than in Whites, and the risk distributions were narrower. The proportion of women classified as at moderate or high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, according to national guidelines, was considerably smaller in non-White women.

DiscussionThe updated BOADICEA (v7), available in the CanRisk tool (www.canrisk.org), is based on estimates more appropriate for non-White women in the UK. Further validation of the model in prospective studies is required. Considering these findings, risk classification guidelines for non- White women may need to be revised.","NA","medrxiv",1740521303023

However, BI-RADS requires manual reading, which is impractical on a large scale and may cause information loss.

MethodsWe extended BOADICEA to incorporate continuous MD measurements, calculated using the automated Volpara and STRATUS software. We used data from the KARMA cohort (60,276 participants; 1,167 incident BC). Associations between MD measurements and BC risk were estimated in a randomly selected training subset (two-thirds of the dataset). Percent MD residuals were calculated after regressing on age at mammography and BMI. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for family history and BOADICEA risk factors, and were incorporated into BOADICEA. The remaining one-third of the cohort was used to assess the performance of the extended BOADICEA (v 7.2) in predicting 5-year risks.

ResultsThe BC HRs per SD of residual STRATUS density were estimated to be 1.48 (95%CI: 1.33-1.64) and 1.41 (95%CI: 1.27-1.56) for pre- and post-menopausal women, respectively. The corresponding estimates for Volpara density were 1.27 (95%CI: 1.15-1.40) and 1.38 (95%CI: 1.25-1.54). The extended BOADICEA showed improved discrimination in the testing dataset over using BIRADS, with a 1-4% increase in AUC across different combinations of risk factors. Based on 5-year BC risk with MD as the sole input, approximately 11% of the women were reclassified into lower risk categories and 18% into higher risk categories using the extended model.

ConclusionIncorporating continuous MD measurements into BOADICEA enhances breast cancer risk stratification and facilitates the use of automated MD measures for risk prediction.","NA","medrxiv",1740521303023

Yet imperiled seabird populations also contain prebreeders, including juveniles and subadults, that wait several years before breeding at colonies. We use previously-published data on reproductive and survival rates for 84 species to quantify the conservation relevance of prebreeding seabirds. We find, first, that prebreeders average about half of seabird populations (median 47.4%, range 11.2%-66.7%). Second, while seabird population growth is much more sensitive to adult survival than prebreeder survival, human-driven changes may shift the importance of prebreeders for future population stability. Third, lowering the breeding age is a powerful, but underexplored, route to increasing population growth. Managing prebreeders could thus play a key role in protecting seabirds. This task may require answering fundamental questions about the behavior of young birds. Broadly, we suggest that life history characteristics (e.g., breeding age) actively shape both obstacles to, and opportunities for, successful conservation.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Both plaques and tangles cause neuronal damage and stimulate inflammatory responses in glial cells. The fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-mediated signaling pathways support the function of damaged neurons and modulate inflammatory response. The FGFR1 agonists, including Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) and FG loop peptide (FGL), have been implicated in multiple disease therapy. Whether FGFR1 agonists can improve pathology and cognitive function in AD remains unknown. Here, we showed that administration of FGF1 and FGL to the AD mouse model reversed spatial memory impairment, enhanced neurogenesis, suppressed reactive astrogliosis, and restricted dystrophic neurite. However, only FGF1 treatment reduced the deposition of senile plaque. In microglial culture studies, FGF1 improves the phagocytosis ability of microglia, which contributes to the clearance of plaques. Together, our findings suggested that FGFR1 agonists alleviate pathology and cognitive impairment via immunomodulatory and improve neuronal health in the AD mouse model.

Multiple phosphatases oppose CDK substrate phosphorylation, yet a systematic understanding of how these phosphatases collectively influence phosphorylation timing is lacking. Here, we show that phosphatases influence the timing of CDK substrate phosphorylation during G2 and mitosis in fission yeast. We identify substrates of four phosphatases (PP2A-B55, PP2A-B56, CDC14, and PP1), showing that each phosphatase targets a distinct subset of CDK substrate sites. On average, sites dephosphorylated by CDC14 and PP2A-B56 are phosphorylated earlier during G2, followed by sites dephosphorylated by PP1 and then PP2A-B55. This suggests that the identity of the phosphatase impacts the timing of CDK substrate phosphorylation, establishing different phosphorylation thresholds at the G2/M transition. Consistent with this, depletion of PP2A-B55 and CDC14 advances mitotic onset independently of CDK activity regulation, likely due to the earlier phosphorylation of their respective CDK substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Similar to other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 proteins modulate host genomic responses through epigenomic modifications, facilitating viral replication and immune evasion. While the nucleocapsid protein is well known for its role in RNA stability and immune modulation, its impact on host chromatin organization remains unclear. To investigate this, we generated stable human alveolar cell lines expressing nucleocapsid proteins from endemic and pandemic human coronaviruses. Our analysis revealed that nucleocapsid proteins from all tested coronaviruses induced changes in nucleosome positioning and occupancy at specific gene promoters involved in coagulation pathways, hormone signaling, and innate immune responses. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific alterations were identified in genes dysregulated in severe infections, such as suggesting a direct role for epigenomic modifications in disease pathophysiology. We also observed extensive changes in nucleosome susceptibility to nuclease digestion in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 samples that were not observed in common cold cell lines. Promoters with altered sensitivity and resistance to nuclease were linked to innate immune, metabolic, olfactory, and signaling pathways known to be dysregulated in severe COVID-19 and post-acute sequelae (PASC). These findings demonstrate that nucleocapsid protein expression alters chromatin structure at specific loci, implicating viral proteins in host genome dysregulation. Furthermore, we identified both shared and unique chromatin targets of SARS-CoV-2 and common cold coronaviruses, highlighting pathways for further investigation and potential therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Studies in Alzheimer's rodent models report that KD and/or ketogenic supplements attenuate cognitive-behavioral impairments, neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta plaques and tau pathology. However, it is unknown whether KD can similarly benefit individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a prevalent condition in which amyloid accumulates in cerebral vessels. CAA is highly comorbid in patients with Alzheimer's and, on its own, increases the risk of stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia, yet no effective treatments currently exist. The objective of this study was to determine whether KD can improve cognitive-behavioral and neuropathological outcomes in a mouse model with CAA. Male Tg-SwDI mice were fed either a standard chow or KD from 3.5 to 7.5 months of age. Following ~3 months of dietary intervention, glucose and ketone-body levels were assessed, then mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate locomotor activity, anxiety-related behaviors, and cognition. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess amyloid pathology, vascular density, neuroinflammation, white matter integrity, and hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition to KD inducing nutritional ketosis and achieving metabolic benefits, mice on KD exhibited increased activity, enhanced spatial learning and memory, and a trend toward improved spatial working memory. These cognitive benefits were accompanied by an attenuation of amyloid pathology and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings suggest that a ketogenic diet may be safe and effective in Alzheimer's and dementia patients with CAA.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Advances in text and data mining (TDM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques offer new opportunities for liberating such information from the literature. Testing and using such approaches to annotate articles in machine actionable formats is therefore necessary to enable the exploitation of existing knowledge in new biology, ecology, and evolution research. Here we explore the potential of these methods to annotate and extract organismal and ecological trait data for the most diverse animal group on Earth, the arthropods. The article processing workflow uses manually curated trait dictionaries with trained NLP models to perform labelling of entities and relationships of thousands of articles. A subset of manually annotated documents facilitated the formal evaluation of the performance of the workflow in terms of entity recognition and normalisation, and relationship extraction, highlighting several important technical challenges. The results are made available to the scientific community through an interactive web tool and queryable resource, the ArTraDB Arthropod Trait Database. These methodological explorations provide a framework that could be extended beyond the arthropods, where TDM and NLP approaches applied to the taxonomy and biodiversity literature will greatly facilitate data synthesis studies and literature reviews, the identification of knowledge gaps and biases, as well as the data-informed investigation of ecological and evolutionary trends and patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

These make it possible to compare genome sequences across the Tree of Life, deepening our understanding of evolutionary relationships. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) is a distance measure that has been applied to species delineation, building of guide trees, and searching large sequence databases. Since computing ANI is computationally expensive, the field has increasingly turned to sketch-based approaches that use assumptions and heuristics to speed this up. We propose a suite of simulated and real benchmark datasets, together with a rank-correlation-based metric, to study how these assumptions and heuristics impact distance estimates. We call this evaluation framework EvANI. With EvANI, we show that ANIb is the ANI estimation algorithm that best captures tree distance, though it is also the least efficient. We show that k-mer based approaches are extremely efficient and have consistently strong accuracy. We also show that some clades have inter-sequence distances that are best computed using multiple values of k, e.g. k=10 and k=19 for Chlamydiales. Finally, we highlight that approaches based on maximal exact matches may represent an advantageous compromise, achieving an intermediate level of computational efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on a single fixed k-mer length.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

A computational network model of the canonical microcircuit consisting of SOM, PV and excitatory neurons reproduced key experimental findings, including: stochastic gamma oscillations with drive-dependent frequency; precise phase-locking of PV interneurons and delayed firing of SOM interneurons; and the distinct effects of optogenetic perturbations of SOM and PV cells. In CAMINOS, the generation of network oscillations depends on both the precise spike timing of SOM and PV interneurons, with PV cells regulating oscillation frequency and network stability, and delayed SOM firing controlling the oscillation amplitude. The asymmetric PV-SOM connectivity is found to be the key source ingredient to generate these oscillations, that naturally establishes distinct PV and SOM-cell spike timing. The CAMINOS model predicts that increased SOM/PV densities along the cortical hierarchy leads to decreased oscillation frequencies (from gamma to alpha/beta) and increased seizure susceptibility, suggesting a unified circuit model for oscillations across different frequency bands.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Bo Yi had two sons who each established a state, one named Huang and the other Xu. After the fall of Huang, its people adopted Huang as their surname and migrated to Hubei. Similarly, after the fall of Xu, its people adopted Xu as their surname, spreading throughout Jiangsu. Further descendants of Bo Yi also gave rise to 12 other surnames, including the Liang surname. Given that the narratives of ancient texts are often regarded as legendary, we aim to independently verify the authenticity of the historical records by analyzing the paternal haplotypes of the Huang surname and its related surnames using scientific methods. We analyzed the surname genetic data of 207,333 Han Chinese males published by 23Mofang and combined it with independent sequencing research. In 189 Y chromosome haplotype branches, each containing at least five individuals with the surnames Huang, Xu, or Liang, and formed around 4,000 years ago, we analyzed the proportion of samples with the Huang surname from Hubei among all samples nationwide with the Huang surname. Branches with a high proportion in Hubei are likely to represent the Hubei-specific lineage of the Huang surname. We similarly analyzed the proportion of samples with the Xu surname in the Jiangsu area and of samples with the Liang surname in the Hebei area. We further applied two criteria to identify the ancestral genotype of a specific surname in a given region: first, the surname should appear at a high frequency among all surnames within that genotype; second, the proportion of samples of the region among nationwide samples should be high. The results showed that the Hubei-specific Huang surname likely carries the MF14296/MF15137 haplotype downstream of the supergrandfather O-M117-F8-F2137-A16635-A16636. Our independent sampling study found that A16636 is the dominant haplotype among the Huang surname population in nine neighboring Huang surname villages around Luohansi in Huangpi, Hubei. The Jiangsu-specific Xu surname likely carries the MF38096/SK1726 haplotype under the A16636 sister branch F15823, while the Hebei-specific Liang surname likely carries the F15823 related MF14287/MF15398/MF14963 haplotype. This conclusion aligns with the historical records, providing strong genetic evidence that supports the authenticity of these ancestral claims regarding the Huang and Xu states and the Xia dynasty.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Human studies on this topic, however, have yielded inconsistent results. We hypothesized that the microbiome would influence innate immune responses, and thus vaccine reactogenicity, more directly than vaccine immunogenicity. To test this, we established the uHEAT (Microbial-Human Ecology And Temperature) study, which longitudinally profiled the fecal microbiota, oral body temperature and serum antibody responses of 171 healthy adults (18-40 years old) before and after vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Increased temperature after vaccination (delta-T) was associated with habitual diet and with baseline metabolic and immune markers. The microbiomes of delta-T-high (delta-Thi) participants were characterized by high expression of flagellin and an overabundance of the flagellated bacterium Waltera. Fecal samples from delta-Thi participants induced more inflammation in human cells and stronger post-vaccine temperature responses in mice compared to delta-Tlo samples, suggesting a causal role for the microbiome. Moreover, Waltera flagellin replicated the inflammatory phenotypes in vitro and was modulable via a dietary additive. Overall, these data suggest that flagellin from the gut microbiome stimulates innate immunity and vaccine reactogenicity, and that this axis can be manipulated via diet. These findings have implications for improving human vaccine tolerance and immunogenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Apical hook opening in dark- grown Arabidopsis seedlings serves as an excellent model to study how coordinated cell expansion generates organ bending. Several works highlight the influence of hormone signaling, cell wall mechanics, and environmental cues on cortical microtubule (cMT) arrangement in bending tissues. However, the precise genetic hierarchy governing these processes remains largely unknown.

ResultsHere, we reveal a two-step growth rate during apical hook opening, in which an initial phase of differential cell expansion is followed by a phase of more balanced growth. We show that cMT re-arrangement precedes and predicts cell expansion patterns, suggesting a central role in coordinating differential growth. Our findings indicate that PIF transcription factors regulate this process, as pifq mutants fail to align cMT reorganization with growth dynamics, resulting in premature hook opening. RNA- seq analysis further supports a role for PIFs in coordinating cell wall remodeling and microtubule-associated gene expression, including kinesins and cell wall-modifying enzymes.

ConclusionsOur study uncovers a PIF-dependent regulatory mechanism that orchestrates cytoskeletal dynamics and cell expansion to control apical hook opening.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Myrmecophagous species are characterized by striking convergent morphological adaptations such as skull elongation, enlargement of salivary glands, and long claws to dig into ant and termite nests. These evolutionary modifications also include anatomical regression, such as dental simplification or loss, reduction of masticatory muscles, and possessing a reduced set of taste buds. To gain insights into the molecular changes underlying the regression of these morpho-anatomical traits, we investigated the functionality of candidate genes related to dentition, gustation, and mastication in nine convergent myrmecophagous mammalian lineages. We examined these genes in a comparative phylogenetic context, paired with molecular evolutionary analyses, to estimate the relative timing of loss of gene function over the evolutionary history of each convergent lineage. We found that gustatory reduction and pseudogenization of masticatory myosin often were associated with the regression of dental genes. Evidence of pseudogenization events linked to oral anatomy dates to as early as the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary, and is an ongoing process including examples of incipient gene inactivations. Whereas we found evidence for gene inactivations across all three functional categories occurring during distinct temporal intervals, there was variation in the sets of genes lost and the relative timing of inactivation events. The combined evidence suggests that the convergent evolution of myrmecophagy has occurred as a protracted process with distinct phases of anatomical evolution, over timescales as long as 60 Myr.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Here we analyzed Agrobacterium natural isolates from the French Collection for Plant-Associated Bacteria (CFBP) and identified two strains with fused chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture identified integration junctions that were different from the C58 fusion strain. Genome-wide DNA replication profiling showed both replication origins remain active. Transposon sequencing revealed that partitioning systems of both chromosome centromeres are essential. Importantly, the site-specific recombinases XerCD are required for the survival of the strains containing the fusion chromosome.

In this study, we identify and characterize a new mechanism in which DnaA modulates cell size independently of oriC-copy number. By altering the levels of DnaA without impacting chromosome replication, we demonstrate that DnaA's activity as a transcription factor can slow down cell elongation rate resulting in cells that are ~20% smaller.

Traditionally, structure-based virtual screening required experimental protein structures, but advances like AlphaFold2 have begun to overcome this limitation. However, AlphaFold2 does not capture ligand-induced conformational changes (transition from apo to holo forms), limiting its utility for protein-ligand docking. In this study, we evaluate AlphaFold3, which predicts protein-ligand complex structures when both protein and ligand inputs are provided. Using the DUD-E dataset and Uni-Dock, we show that holo structures predicted with ligand inclusion yield higher screening performance than apo structures generated without ligand input. Notably, incorporating active ligands enhances screening performance, whereas inactive (decoy) ligands produce results similar to apo predictions. The use of template structures further improves outcomes. We also analyze the impact of ligand molecular weight, binding pocket location, and AlphaFold3 ranking scores on screening performance. Our findings indicate that lower molecular weight ligands tend to generate predicted structures that more closely resemble experimental holo structures, thus improving screening efficacy. Conversely, larger ligands (700-800) can induce open binding pockets that favor screening for some targets. These results suggest that employing AlphaFold3 with appropriate ligand inputs is a promising strategy for virtual screening, particularly for proteins lacking experimental structural data.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

To address this gap, we conducted an extensive literature review and developed DateBack (https://cloudapps.france-bioinformatique.fr/dateback), a digital open access repository of archaeobotanical remains of Phoenix spp. In its first version, DateBack records macroremains (e.g., seeds, fruits, stems, petioles) from prehistoric to Late Antiquity contexts in Southwest and South Asia. We assembled 140 entries from 99 archaeological sites across 110 references, along with a separate table of 55 radiocarbon-dated entries from 17 sites, refining chronological assessments. Most entries comprise charred seeds (55.7%), with a smaller proportion of charred vegetative parts or desiccated remains. Our findings highlight regional disparities in remain distribution, concentrated in the Levant and Gulf, while Saudi Arabia and southern Iran are underrepresented, and in data reliability, particularly dating resolution, complicating the reconstruction of date cultivation history. Our evidence shows that the earliest securely dated remains, indicating date consumption, appear in the Gulf around 5000 BCE, while cultivation emerges later, first in southern Mesopotamia and the northern Gulf in the 4th millennium BCE, then in eastern Arabia and the Indus Valley in the 3rd millennium BCE.

The efficacy of buparlisib (PI3Ki) and ribociclib (CDK4/6i), individually and combined, was assessed in vitro using PPGL cell lines, rat- and patient-derived primary cells, and in vivo using PPGL cells-derived mouse xenografts. The combination therapy demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared to single agents, particularly in vivo. Mechanistically, the efficacy of the combination therapy was associated to the downregulation of FOXM1-controlled genes implicated in mitotic spindle assembly and chromosomal segregation, leading to mitotic catastrophe. Data mining and qRT-PCR showed this genetic signature to be upregulated in human mPPGLs. This suggests that aggressive PPGLs exhibit heightened vulnerability to dual PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibition, offering a promising therapeutic avenue for these challenging cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Prism-based TIRF (p-TIRF) microscopes are comparatively easy to use. They may be readily adjusted to meet the requirements of a broad range of experimental applications, such as to examine of macromolecular complexes, to study of the behaviour of vesicles and small organelles, the study of protein-DNA complexes at the single-molecule level. These experiments can give unique insights into the mechanisms driving the molecular interactions that underline many fundamental activities within the cell by providing information on fluctuation distributions and unusual events. Here, we report a detailed method to build a p-TIRF setup inexpensively using an existing confocal microscope where the same light source can be used for both systems. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview that aims to give the readers a stepwise tutorial protocol for building, assembling, aligning, and preparing the specimen to conduct single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments using a custom-built p-TIRF setup. We believe that this article will be of assistance to labs that already have a confocal microscope and want to perform TIRF experiments for potential future applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

To improve resilience, understanding these is crucial, but large-scale GRNs (>100 genes) are difficult to model using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) due to the high number of parameters that have to be estimated. Here we solve this problem by introducing BADDADAN, which uses machine learning to identify gene modules - groups of co-expressed and/or co-regulated genes - and constructs an ODE model that predicts gene module dynamics under stress. By integrating time-series gene expression data with prior co-expression data it finds modules that are both coherent and interpretable. We demonstrate BADDADAN on heat and drought datasets of A. thaliana, modelling over 1,000 genes, recovering known mechanistic insights, and proposing new hypotheses. By combining machine learning with mechanistic modelling, BADDADAN deepens our understanding of stress-related GRNs in plants and potentially other organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

While computed tomography (CT)-based screening has improved early detection and enabled curative surgeries, the molecular and cellular dynamics driving early-stage LUAD progression remain poorly understood, limiting non-surgical treatment options. To address this gap, we profiled 2.24 million cells from 122 early-stage LUAD patients using multiplexed imaging mass cytometry (IMC). This analysis revealed the molecular, spatial, and temporal dynamics of LUAD development.

Our findings uncover a binary progression model. LUAD advances through either inflammation, driven by a balance of cytotoxic and regulatory immune activity, or fibrosis, characterized by stromal activation. Surprisingly, tumor cell populations did not increase significantly. Instead, they displayed a mixed phenotypic profile consistent with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), effectively masking the expansion of malignant cells.

Furthermore, we addressed discrepancies between CT-based and histology-based subtyping. CT scans, while non-invasive, often mischaracterize invasive fibrotic tumors--which account for 20.5% of LUAD cases--as mild, non-solid ground glass opacities (GGOs). Using high-content IMC imaging, we demonstrate that these tumors harbor significant risks and advocate for improved diagnostic strategies. These strategies should integrate molecular profiling to refine patient stratification and therapeutic decision-making.

Altogether, our study provides a high-resolution, systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment in early-stage LUAD. We characterize key transitions in oncogenesis and propose a precision-driven framework to enhance the detection and management of aggressive disease subtypes.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Central to its therapeutic effects are cannabinoids, which interact with the endocannabinoid system to influence various physiological processes such as anxiety, pain, and inflammation. Despite its benefits, cannabinoid production faces challenges and scarcity from plant extraction. This work leverages Yarrowia lipolytica as a platform for cannabinoid biosynthesis. By optimizing precursor supply, engineering biomolecular condensate-like dual prenyltransferase expression and expanding endogenous metabolism with a noncanonical polyketide synthase, we achieved the de novo biosynthesis of various cannabinoid and its analogs. Our engineered Y. lipolytica produced ~3.5 mg/L of cannabigerolic acid, 18.8 mg/L of orsellinic acid, and 0.5 mg/L of cannabigerorcinic acid. Additionally, CBGA titer reached 15.7 mg/L with olivetolic acid supplement. This work demonstrates Y. lipolytica's versatility as a promising host for cannabinoid and its analogs production, which opens avenues for further research and medicinal applications.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Analysis of spontaneous events typically requires evaluation of hundreds of events over minutes to hours, and the most common method of analysis, z-scoring, was not designed for this purpose. Here, we compare the accuracy and reliability of three different analysis methods to identify pharmacologically induced changes in dopamine release and uptake in freely moving C57BL/6J mice. The D1-like receptor antagonist SCH23390 was used to prevent dLight sensors from interacting with dopamine in the extracellular space, while cocaine was used to inhibit uptake and raclopride to increase release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. We examined peak-to-peak frequency, peak amplitude, and width, the time spent above an established cutoff. The three methods were 1) the widely-used ""Z-Score Method"", which automatically smooths baseline drift and normalizes recordings using signal-to-noise ratios, 2) a ""Manual Method"", in which local baselines were adjusted manually and individual cutoffs were determined for each subject, and 3) the ""Prominence Method"" that combines z-scoring with prominence assessment to tag individual peaks, then returns to the preprocessed data for kinetic analysis. First, SCH23390 drastically reduced the number of signals detected as expected, but only when the Manual Method was used. Z-scoring failed to identify any changes, due to its amplification of noise when signals were diminished. Cocaine increased signal width as expected using the Manual and Prominence Methods, but not the Z-Score Method. Finally, raclopride-induced increases in amplitude were correctly identified by the Manual and Prominence Methods. The Z-Score Method failed to identify any of the changes in dopamine release and uptake kinetics. Thus, analysis of spontaneous dopamine signals requires assessment of the %{Delta}F/F values, ideally using the Manual Method, and the use of z-scoring is not appropriate.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

DNA from unfractionated (> 0.2um) seawater samples was amplified using the 515Y/926R universal three-domain rRNA gene primers, simultaneously quantifying the relative abundance of amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) from bacteria, archaea, eukaryotic nuclear 18S, and eukaryotic plastid 16S. Thus, the ratio between taxa in one sample is directly comparable to the ratio in any other GRUMP sample, regardless of gene copy number differences. This obviates a problem in prior global studies that used size-fractionation and different rRNA gene primers for bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, precluding comparisons across size fractions or domains. On average, bacteria contributed 71%, eukaryotes 19%, and archaea 8% to rRNA gene abundance, though eukaryotes contributed 32% at latitudes > 40.

Similarly, despite well-documented sex differences in opioid responses, the anatomical basis for this sexual dimorphism is not well characterized. To address these questions, we developed an automated, scalable, and unbiased approach for whole-brain anatomical mapping of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in response to acute morphine exposure. Using ribbon scanning confocal microscopy, we imaged whole cleared brains from male and female wild-type mice at 1 hour and 4 hours post-morphine administration. Our whole-brain analysis of c-Fos expression revealed distinct patterns of morphine-induced regional brain activation across time and sex. Notably, we observed a greater number of structures with significant activity differences at 4 hours compared to 1 hour. In male mice, significant changes were primarily localized to regions within the dopamine system, whereas in female mice, they were concentrated in cortical regions. By combining high-throughput imaging with whole-brain expression analysis, particularly in the context of opioid actions, our approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how drugs of abuse affect the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

Unmodified RNAs stimulate human innate immunity, but RNA modifications suppress this response. mRNA m6A modification is essential for Arabidopsis thaliana viability. However, the molecular basis of the impact of mRNA m6A depletion is poorly understood. Here, we show that disruption of the Arabidopsis mRNA m6A writer complex triggers autoimmunity. Most gene expression changes in m6A writer complex vir-1 mutants grown at 17{degrees}C are explained by defence gene activation and are suppressed at 27{degrees}C, consistent with the established temperature sensitivity of Arabidopsis immunity. Accordingly, we found enhanced pathogen resistance and increased premature cell death in vir-1 mutants at 17{degrees}C but not 27{degrees}C. Global temperature-sensitive mRNA poly(A) tail length changes accompany these phenotypes. Our results demonstrate that autoimmunity is a major phenotype of mRNA m6A writer complex mutants, which has important implications for interpreting this modifications role.

However, these mechanisms fail to explain how new methylation patterns are generated. In Arabidopsis, CLASSY3 (CLSY3) targets the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery to different loci in reproductive tissues, generating distinct epigenomes via unknown mechanism(s). Here, we discovered that several different REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM (REM) transcription factors are required for methylation at CLSY3 targets specific to male or female reproductive tissues. We designate these factors as REM INSTRUCT METHYLATION (RIMs) and demonstrate that disruption of their DNA binding domains, or the motifs they recognize, blocks RdDM. These findings not only reveal RIMs as the first sex-specific RdDM proteins but also establish a critical role for genetic information in targeting DNA methylation. This novel mode of targeting expands our understanding of how methylation is regulated to include inputs from both genetic and epigenetic information.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

During smooth pursuit eye movements, the floccular complex performs distinct input-output transformations of temporal dynamics and directional response properties. The responses of different interneuron types localize the circuit mechanisms of each transformation. Mossy fibers and unipolar brush cells emphasize eye position dynamics uniformly across the cardinal axes; Purkinje cells and molecular layer interneurons code eye velocity along directionally biased axes; Golgi cells show unmodulated firing. Differential directional response properties of different neuron types localize the directional input-output transformation to the last-order inputs to Purkinje cells. Differential temporal dynamics pinpoint the site of the temporal input-output transformation to granule cells. Specific granule cell population dynamics allow the temporal transformations required in the area we study and generalize to many temporal transformations, providing a complete framework to understand cerebellar circuit computation.

Impact statementWe dissect the circuit computations performed by the floccular complex of the cerebellum during an exemplar sensory-motor behavior, taking advantage of knowledge of the circuit architecture, existence of discrete neuron types, and a newfound ability to identify neuron types from extracellular recordings. Our results describe the contributions of the major neuron types to the cerebellar input-output computations, identify the population dynamics needed in granule cells to support those computations, and to create a basis set to enable temporally-specific motor behavior and motor learning.","NA","biorxiv",1740521303023

For this, cellular and circuit components in intact brains need to be identified and studied using e.g. viral tracing, electrophysiology, imaging, activity perturbations, and behavior. A commonality of these approaches is the need to establish the anatomical locations of both experimental parameters (e.g. recording/injection sites) and circuit components (e.g. cell bodies/projections). The development of standardized coordinate systems, i.e. reference brain atlases, has proven essential for reproducible, cross-laboratory mapping of anatomical data. However, the process of mapping, analyzing, and visualizing anatomical data remains challenging, especially for users lacking programming expertise. Here, we introduce DMC-BrainMap, an open-source napari plugin designed as a user-friendly tool for streamlined processing and whole-brain analysis of anatomical data. The working principle and core functionalities include all steps after image acquisition, i.e., preprocessing of images, registration of images to a reference atlas, segmentation of different anatomical features, and data analysis/visualization. DMC-BrainMap can be applied to histological data obtained from a variety of model organisms at different developmental stages, including mouse, rat, and zebrafish. We demonstrate the utility of DMC-BrainMap by mapping and quantifying cell bodies, axonal densities, injection sites as well as placement of optical fibers and Neuropixels probes.
