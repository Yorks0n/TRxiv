Persistently elevated autoantibodies have been found in some individuals with long COVID (LC). Using a >21,000 human protein array, we identified diverse AAB targets in LC patients that correlated with their symptoms. Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196688

The rapid evolution of H5 HPAIVs continues to raise concern with heightened zoonotic and pandemic risks. The immunodominant haemagglutinin glycoprotein (HA) is crucial for influenza virus receptor binding and pH-induced fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Mutations in HA are frequent due to polymerase error, immune pressure and host adaptation, resulting in antigenic modulation and/or an expansion of host tropism, respectively, ultimately hindering control strategies. We evaluated a comprehensive panel of H5 viruses representing prevalent genotypes from UK outbreaks spanning 2020 to 2022 for HA functionality. HA genes from each genotype were assessed through receptor binding, pH of fusion, thermostability and HA inhibition assays to evaluate factors contributing to zoonotic potential, stability, and antigenicity. The viruses only bound to avian receptors and exhibited fusion at a pH of 5.8, above the pH range (pH 5.0 to 5.5) associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Therefore, these H5 viruses have low immediate zoonotic threat. Contemporary H5 viruses were more thermostable and showed antigenic drift compared to the earlier 2017-2018 clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 viruses, and N236D in HA was identified as a significant antigenic epitope. The findings of this study underscore the evolving nature of the HA of these viruses and highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance and characterisation efforts to identify factors that might contribute to zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196688

Here, we demonstrate that RTN4IP1 deficiency causes a CI assembly defect in both patient fibroblasts and knockout cells, and report that RTN4IP1 is a bona fide CI assembly factor. Complexome profiling revealed accumulation of unincorporated ND5-module and impaired N-module production. RTN4IP1 patient fibroblasts also exhibited defective coenzyme Q biosynthesis, substantiating this emerging function of RTN4IP1.

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha).

Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes inside Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes are segregated into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively.

To maintain the infection cycle, soil phages must travel from one suitable host to the next. However, traversing the soil matrix presents a dangerous journey for phages, which need to encounter the right hosts in this spatially complex habitat, but are not capable of active motion and can adsorb to soil particles. Here, we tested the hypothesis that bacterial-feeding nematodes (roundworms) present a reliable vehicle of soil transport for phages. First, we demonstrated that the bacterivorous nematode Caenorhabditis elegans vectored the laboratory model phage T7 as well as the soil phage {Phi} Ppu-W11 on agar. Sorption assays carried out with paralyzed and non-paralyzed nematodes showed that phage transport can occur via both external cuticular attachment and ingestion, and that the presence of host bacteria is not required for phage vectoring. Finally, we designed a microcosm to test phage transfer in compost and sandy soil using C. elegans and its sister species, C. remanei, respectively. This experiment confirmed that nematodes also enable phage movement through complex spatial habitats. This novel mechanism of phage vectoring extends our understanding of virus transmission in soil, revealing new multitrophic interactions that may influence soil functioning.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

We assessed immune responses in n=42 health-care workers (median age 47 years, interquartile range, IQR 19,5 years, 48% male), who in August 2024 were vaccinated with 30 microg of the updated mRNA omicron JN.1 vaccine (bretovameran, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany). Humoral immune responses were analyzed directly prior to and 13 days after vaccination. The omicron JN.1 vaccination resulted in a significant 1,2-fold increase of anti-S IgG and 1,2-fold increase of omicron anti-S IgG (p<0,0001). To assess plasma neutralisation capacity, we employed a pseudovirus particle (pp) neutralisation assay including S proteins of seven SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Baseline response rates were 100% for XBB.1.5pp, 90% for JN.1pp and KP.2pp, 82% for KP.2.3pp, 92% for KP.3pp, and 72% for LB.1pp. Before JN.1 vaccination, particles bearing KP sublineage S proteins were slightly less efficiently neutralised compared with JN.1pp (median change, 1,2-fold to 2,6-fold), while LB.1pp neutralisation was 3-fold reduced, indicating antibody evasion. After vaccination, the response rates increased significantly for all pseudoviruses except XBB.1.5pp and KP.3pp. Thus, we observed a significant increase in neutralisation of JN.1pp, KP.2pp, KP.2.3pp, and LB.1pp, showing a median change of 2.2-fold, 3.8-fold, 3.3-fold, and 4.9-fold, respectively. In summary, bretovameran increased anti-S IgG and strengthened neutralising responses against circulating SARS-CoV-2-variants, except for KP.3. We wish to point out that our study population exhibited high pre-vaccination omicron-related hybrid immunity and may not be representative of other populations. Our data supports the notion that the new mRNA vaccine against omicron JN.1 most likely increases protection against hospitalization and post-COVID sequelae caused by most current variants.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

In this study, we report on the neutralizing antibody (nAb) escape, infectivity, fusion, and stability of these subvariants-LB.1, KP.2.3, KP.3, and KP.3.1.1. Our findings demonstrate that all of these subvariants are highly evasive of nAbs elicited by the bivalent mRNA vaccine, the XBB.1.5 monovalent mumps virus-based vaccine, or from infections during the BA.2.86/JN.1 wave. This reduction in nAb titers is primarily driven by a single serine deletion (DelS31) in the NTD of the spike, leading to a distinct antigenic profile compared to the parental JN.1 and other variants. We also found that the DelS31 mutation decreases pseudovirus infectivity in CaLu-3 cells, which correlates with impaired cell-cell fusion. Additionally, the spike protein of DelS31 variants appears more conformationally stable, as indicated by reduced S1 shedding both with and without stimulation by soluble ACE2, and increased resistance to elevated temperatures. Molecular modeling suggests that the DelS31 mutation induces a conformational change that stabilizes the NTD and strengthens the NTD-Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) interaction, thus favoring the down conformation of RBD and reducing accessibility to both the ACE2 receptor and certain nAbs. Additionally, the DelS31 mutation introduces an N-linked glycan modification at N30, which shields the underlying NTD region from antibody recognition. Our data highlight the critical role of NTD mutations in the spike protein for nAb evasion, stability, and viral infectivity, and suggest consideration of updating COVID-19 vaccines with antigens containing DelS31.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups.

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

We have generated 3D genomic datasets consisting of promoter-focused Capture-C, Hi-C, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq and integrated these data with GWAS of 16 autoimmune traits to physically map disease-associated variants to the effector genes they likely regulate in 57 human cell types. These 3D maps of gene cis-regulatory architecture are highly powered to identify the cell types most likely impacted by disease-associated genetic variation compared to 1D genomic features, and tend to implicate different effector genes than eQTL approaches in the same cell types. Most of the variants implicated by these cis-regulatory architectures are highly trait-specific, but nearly half of the target genes connected to these variants are shared across multiple autoimmune disorders in multiple cell types, suggesting a high level of genetic diversity and complexity among autoimmune diseases that nonetheless converge at the level of target gene and cell type. Substantial effector gene sharing led to the common enrichment of similar biological networks across disease and cell types. However, trait-specific pathways representing potential areas for disease-specific intervention were identified. To test this, we pharmacologically validated squalene synthase, a cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme encoded by the FDFT1 gene implicated by our approach in MS and SLE, as a novel immunomodulatory drug target controlling inflammatory cytokine production by human T cells. These data represent a comprehensive resource for basic discovery of gene cis-regulatory mechanisms, and the analyses reported reveal mechanisms by which autoimmune-associated variants act to regulate gene expression, function, and pathology across multiple, distinct tissues and cell types.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

Predictive processing has been repeatedly demonstrated and seemingly explains expectation suppression (ES), or the attenuation of neural activity in response to expected stimuli. However, the mechanisms behind ES are unclear and various models of the mechanisms supporting ES have been suggested with conflicting evidence. Sharpening models propose that expectations suppress neurons that are not tuned to the expected stimulus, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for expected stimuli. In contrast, dampening models posit that expectations suppress neurons that are tuned to the expected stimuli, increasing the relative response amplitude for unexpected stimuli. Previous studies have used decoding analyses to examine these effects, with increases in decoding accuracy interpreted in terms of sharpening and decreases related to dampening. The opposing process theory (OPT) has suggested that both processes may occur at different time points, namely that initial sharpening is followed by later dampening of the neural representations of the expected stimulus as learning progresses. In this study we aim to test this theory and shed light on the dynamics of expectation effects, both at single trial level and over time. Thirty-one participants completed a statistical learning task consisting of paired scene categories whereby a 'leading' image from one category is quickly followed by a 'trailing' image from a different category. Multivariate EEG analyses focussed on decoding stimulus information related to the trailing image category. Within-trial, decoding analyses showed that stimulus expectation increased decoding accuracy at early latencies and decreased decoding accuracy at later latencies, in line with OPT. However, across trials, stimulus expectation decreased decoding accuracy in initial trials and increased decoding accuracy in later trials. We theorise that these dissociable dynamics of expectation effects within and across trials can be explained in the context of hierarchical learning mechanisms. Our single trial results provide evidence for the OPT, while our results over time suggest that sharpening and dampening effects emerge at different stages of learning.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

However, the prevalence of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs among Japanese has remained unclear. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in Japan using a nationwide survey of 28,175 residents aged 16-81 years old. Methods: A nationally representative, cross-sectional self-administered survey was conducted from September to October 2021. To assess the number of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, we used three questions from the Oxford Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey. Independent variables included general vaccine conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic variables, information sources for COVID-19, trust in authorities, and fear of COVID-19. Results: After applying sampling weights and imputation, the estimated prevalence of holding at least one COVID-19 conspiracy belief was 24.4%. From a linear regression model, several factors were independently associated with conspiracy beliefs. Notably, people with the lowest level of education (lower secondary school) endorsed fewer COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (B -0.089, vs. upper secondary school). Furthermore, higher socioeconomic backgrounds-such as higher income, higher wealth, and regular employment-were associated with endorsing conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, only 37.3% of respondents trusted the government of Japan, but paradoxically, trust in the government was positively associated with conspiracy beliefs (B 0.175, vs. distrust). Conclusions: Conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 were prevalent in about a quarter of the Japanese population. Certain groups are more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, and targeting interventions towards these groups might be efficient in stemming the spread of conspiracy beliefs.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

As a COG-UK partner, Quadram Institute Bioscience (QIB) in Norfolk sequenced over 87,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, contributing to the region becoming densely sequenced. Retrospective analysis of SARS-CoV-2 lineage dynamics in this region may contribute to preparedness for future pandemics. Methods: 29,406 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences and corresponding metadata from Norfolk were extracted from the COG-UK dataset, sampled between March 2020 and December 2022, representing 9.9% of regional COVID-19 cases. Sequences were lineage typed using Pangolin, and subsequent lineage analysis carried out in R using RStudio and related packages, including graphical analysis using ggplot2. Results: 401 global lineages were identified, with 69.8% appearing more than once and 31.2% over ten times. Temporal clustering identified six lineage communities based on first lineage emergence. Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern (VOC) accounted for 8.6%, 34.9% and 48.5% of sequences respectively. These formed four regional epidemic waves alongside the remaining lineages which appeared in the early pandemic prior to VOC designation and were termed pre-VOC lineages. Regional comparison highlighted variability in VOC epidemic wave dates dependent on location. Conclusion: This study is the first to assess SARS-CoV-2 diversity in Norfolk across a large timescale within the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 was both highly diverse and dynamic throughout the Norfolk region between March 2020 - December 2022, with a strong VOC presence within the latter two thirds of the study period. The study also displays the utility of incorporating genomic epidemiological methods into pandemic response.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Catatonic symptoms are treatable with pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy, but the longitudinal effectiveness of these treatments has not been described. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of patients with autism and co-morbid catatonia who received outpatient care in a specialized outpatient clinic from July 1st, 2021 to May 31st, 2024. Data investigating pharmacologic interventions, and clinical measures including the Bush Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), Kanner Catatonia Severity Scale (KCS), Kanner Catatonia Examination (KCE), and Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) were collected. Results: Forty-five patients were identified with 39 (86.7%) meeting criteria for profound autism. All patients received pharmacotherapy. 44 (97.8%) were treated with benzodiazepines with a mean maximal daily dose of 17.4 mg (SD=15.8) lorazepam equivalents. Thirty-five patients (77.8%) required more than one medication class for treatment. Fourteen patients (31.1%) attempted to taper off benzodiazepines during the study period; of these, 5 patients (11.1%) were successfully tapered off, and the remaining 9 (17.8%) discontinued the taper due to a return of catatonic symptoms. Statistically significant improvement was observed across all clinical domains except the KCS. However, the majority remained symptomatic over the study period. Conclusions: Despite clinical improvements while receiving the gold standard for psychopharmacologic management of catatonia, chronic symptoms remained for the majority of catatonia patients over the study period, and few were able to taper and discontinue benzodiazepine treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

In addition, individual European countries developed their own risk classifications for severe COVID-19 to select individuals recommended for annual COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the discordance between the European and respective national medical risk classifications in assigning children and adults to risk groups for developing severe COVID-19 in populations of the Netherlands and Norway. Methods: This multi-country, healthcare data-linkage study covered 17.4 million inhabitants of the Netherlands and 5.6 million inhabitants of Norway by 1 January 2020. Medical conditions were defined based on ICD-10 hospital discharge codes in the European and Dutch classifications, and on ICD-10 and ICPC-2 primary care codes in the Norwegian classification. Subjects were classified as high-, moderate-, or low-risk. Discordance was calculated as the proportion of the population with a different risk status in the respective national compared to the European classification. Findings: The overall discordance between European and national risk classification was 12.0% in the Dutch and 13.8% in the Norwegian population. The European classification assigns more individuals to high-risk (9.0% and 9.2% of the Dutch and Norwegian populations, respectively) than the national classifications (1.5% and 3.0%, respectively). National classifications define more individuals as moderate-risk (11.3% and 12.7%, respectively) than the European classification (1.0% and 1.3%, respectively). Classification discordances most frequently involved subjects with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and diabetes mellitus. Interpretation: The European classification defines a substantially larger percentage of the population as high-risk for severe COVID-19 than the national classifications. This may have implications for post-pandemic vaccination programs. Further research should assess to what extent the medical conditions responsible for the classification discordances determine the risk of developing severe COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

However, most lack a formal approach to analyse the parameters and context-specific variations of these regulatory components. This study addresses this gap by establishing formal and convenient methods for characterising regulatory circuits. We model the bacterial cell as a collection of a small number of proteome fractions. Then, we derive the proteome fraction over time and obtain a general theorem describing its change as a function of its expression fraction, which represents a specific portion of the total biosynthesis flux of the cell. Formal deduction reveals that when the proteome fraction reaches a maximum, it becomes equivalent to its expression fraction. This equation enables the reliable measurement of the expression fraction through direct protein quantification. In addition, experimental data demonstrate a linear correlation between protein production rate and specific growth rate over a significant time period. This suggests a constant expression fraction within this window. The expression fractions estimated from the slopes of these intervals and those obtained from maximum protein amount points can both be independently fitted to a Hill function. In the case of an IPTG biosensor, in five cellular contexts, expression fractions determined by the maximum method and the slope method produced similar dose-response parameters. Additionally, by analysing two more biosensors, for mercury and cumate detection, we demonstrate that the slope method can be effectively applied to various systems, generating reliable Hill function parameters.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Thousands of ATAC-seq samples have been collected that hold information about chromatin accessibility across diverse cell types and contexts, but most of these are not paired with genetic information and come from diverse distinct projects and laboratories.

ResultsWe report here joint genotyping, chromatin accessibility peak calling, and discovery of quantitative trait loci which influence chromatin accessibility (caQTLs), demonstrating the capability of performing caQTL analysis on a large scale in a diverse sample set without pre-existing genotype information. Using 10,293 profiling samples representing 1,454 unique donor individuals across 653 studies from public databases, we catalog 23,381 caQTLs in total. After joint discovery analysis, we cluster samples based on accessible chromatin profiles to identify context-specific caQTLs. We find that caQTLs are strongly enriched for annotations of gene regulatory elements across diverse cell types and tissues and are often strongly linked with genetic variation associated with changes in expression (eQTLs), indicating that caQTLs can mediate genetic effects on gene expression. We demonstrate sharing of causal variants for chromatin accessibility and diverse complex human traits, enabling a more complete picture of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex human phenotypes.

ConclusionsOur work provides a proof of principle for caQTL calling from previously ungenotyped samples, and represents one of the largest, most diverse caQTL resources currently available, informing mechanisms of genetic regulation of gene expression and contribution to disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Methods We analyzed the seroprevalence for CHIKV and ONNV in 470 non-febrile subjects from three regions in Senegal (Sindia, 2018; Thies, 2018; and Kedougou, 2022/2023) using retrospective samples. We assessed the presence of anti-CHIKV IgG and neutralizing titers against CHIKV and ONNV via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microneutralization tests, respectively, and determined risk factors of CHIKV and ONNV exposure by binary logistic regression.  Results The overall seroprevalence of anti-CHIKV IgG was 24.89% (117/470). Regional seroprevalences were 14.89% (14/94) in Sindia, 28.72% (27/94) in Thies, and 26.95% (76/282) in Kedougou.

Conclusions Our study confirms significant exposure to CHIKV and ONNV across Senegal, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance and alphavirus testing among the population.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

Herein we found that the RNA m6A methyltransferase METTL3 was upregulated in lung carcinoma tissues. Elevated METTL3 level was correlated with diminished CD8+ T cell infiltration and cancer progression in lung carcinoma patients. METTL3 deficiency exacerbated nuclear DNA leakage into the cytoplasm, activating the cGAS pathway and thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, METTL3 deficiency reduced the homologous recombination repair efficacy via downregulation of MSH5, a mutS family protein involved in DNA mismatch repair, leading to increased cytosolic DNA levels. m6A methylation of A2521 of MSH5 stabilized its mRNA via binding with IGF2BP2. On the other hand, m6A methylation of A1545 at the CDS of cGAS decreased mRNA stability and regulates its protein expression. Functionally, knockdown of METTL3 sensitized lung carcinoma cells to the PARP inhibitors. In vivo and clinical data confirmed the positive roles of METTL3 inhibition-activated cGAS/STING axis in tumor growth and lung adenocarcinoma progression. Collectively, METTL3 inhibition activates the cGAS/STING-mediated anti-tumor immunity via induction of cytosolic DNA and cGAS expression, which in turn regulate PARP inhibitor response and cancer progression in lung carcinoma.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

While these chemicals are often considered to have restricted activity and are labelled as such, there are concerns over a broader toxicity range. Here we report the impact of 1076 pollutants spanning diverse chemistries and indicated applications on 22 prevalent commensal gut bacteria. Our systematic investigation uncovered 588 interactions involving 168 chemicals, the majority of which were not previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact with circa 30% exhibiting anti-commensal properties. We find that the sensitivity to chemical pollutants across species surprisingly correlates with that to human-targeted drugs, suggesting common susceptibility mechanisms. Using a genome-wide chemical-genetic screen, we identified membrane transport and fatty acid metabolism as major modulators of the off-target toxicity of chemicals. Mutants exhibiting chemical resistance include those defective in producing human-health-relevant metabolites like branched short-chain fatty acids, indicating that chronic exposure could lead to selection against production of beneficial metabolites. Toxicokinetic modelling suggested gut bacteria could be used as more sensitive in vitro toxicity indicators for chemicals of concern than animal models. Together, our data uncovers the off-target activity of industrial and agricultural chemicals with widespread exposure against human gut bacteria. Impact on the structure and function of the microbiota should therefore be considered in assessing chemical safety.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Available data support that the burst of cytokines and bradykinin, observed in some COVID-19 patients, sustains systemic inflammation and the hypercoagulant state, thus increasing thrombotic risk. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) can play a direct role in the activation of the coagulation cascade. Adding Mpro to human plasma from healthy donors increased clotting probability by 2.5-fold. The results of enzymatic assays and degradomics analysis indicate that Mpro triggers plasma clotting by proteolytically activating coagulation factors zymogens VII and XII at their physiological activation sites, i.e. Arg152-Ile153 bond for FVII and Arg353-Val354 bond for FXII, where FVII and FXII are strategically positioned at the very beginning of the extrinsic or intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation. These findings are not compatible with the substrate specificity of the protease known so far, displaying a prevalence for a Gln-residue in P1 and a hydrophobic amino acid in P2 position. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by High Throughput Protease Screen assay, unveiling an extended, time-dependent, secondary specificity of Mpro for Arg-X bonds, which was further confirmed by Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass spectrometry analysis of Arg-containing inhibitors binding to Mpro and by enzymatic assays showing that the protease can cleave peptide substrates containing Arg in P1. Overall, integrating biochemical, proteomics and structural biology experiments, we unveil a novel mechanism linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to thrombotic complications in COVID-19.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

Evolutionary transitions between sex-chromosome systems-- which change the chromosome pair that determines sex, the system of heterogamety, or both--are frequent in some clades. In others, however, sex chromosome systems show long-term stability. Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex linkage, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that the ordinary operation of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits can, as a by-product, promote stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection on a trait permits individual chromosomes genetic contributions to the trait to drift upwards or downwards, subject only to the constraint that they all sum to the trait optimum. This chromosome-specific drift causes reduced fitness in individuals with unusual chromosomal constitutions, such as the novel sexual genotypes that sex chromosome turnovers always produce. The theory can explain a suite of patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems. Applied to interspecific hybrids, it can also explain two key observations concerning their reduced fitness: Haldanes rule and the large-X effect.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Thus, TRAIP promotes DNA inter-strand crosslink repair by triggering the disassembly of CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicases that have converged on these lesions. However, disassembly of single CMGs that have stalled temporarily would be deleterious, suggesting that TRAIP must be carefully regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. We further show that TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37s response to topological stress. In conclusion, we propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

The developing conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) secretes factors which modify the endometrium and can be critical for early pregnancy processes such maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) and enhancing uterine receptivity to implantation. For example, a competent bovine conceptus secretes IFNT to initiate MRP. The bovine conceptus also secretes other proteins at the time of MRP, including CAPG and PDI, which are highly conserved among placental mammals. We have previously shown that these proteins act upon the endometrium to modulate receptivity, embryo development, and implantation in species with different implantation strategies (humans and cattle). We hypothesise that developing a novel 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system will enhance our understanding of the role of conceptus-derived factors in altering the endometrium and/or ULF secretion. Here we have developed a 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system, comprising both stromal and epithelial cell culture combined with culture medium flow better mimics the in vivo endometrium and exposure to conceptus-derived factors than conventional 2D endometrial cell culture. We have demonstrated that the conceptus-derived proteins CAPG and PDI modulate the endometrial transcriptome and secretory response to promote pathways associated with early pregnancy and alter ULF composition. This work highlights the critical need for more robust and in vivo -like culture systems to study endometrial-conceptus interactions in vitro to further investigate the role of conceptus derived factors for pregnancy success.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe have developed an in vitro 3D bovine endometrium-on-a-chip system comprising both primary stromal cells under static conditions and epithelial cells under flow conditions to mimic the in vivo endometrial environment from the conceptuses perspective. The secretome of the 3D endometrium-on-a-chip was characterised, was found to contain proteins associated with cell adhesion and tissue development, and contained proteins previously identified in in vivo uterine luminal fluid. PDI and CAPG (previously identified conceptus-derived factors) altered the transcriptome and secretome of cells within the system. Exposure to CAPG or PDI altered the secretome of proteins previously identified in pregnant uterine luminal fluid or associated with early pregnancy, and exposure to CAPG or PDI also altered the transcriptome to support processes such as immune response, secretion, proliferation, and adhesion related pathways. This data supports previously published works and highlights the need for the use of more in vivo-like in vitro models to study conceptus-endometrial interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

The valproic acid (VPA) rodent model is the most widely used model for the study of idiopathic ASD, but almost all of the studies have used male rodents.

MethodTo fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated sex differences for neuronal activity, morphology, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) signaling in primary cortical (CTX) and hippocampal (HIP) neurons prepared from rats exposed to VPA in utero. In vivo, sex-specific VPA-induced alterations in the frontal CTX transcriptome at birth were also determined.

ResultsOverall, VPA induced more robust changes in neuronal function and structure in the CTX than in the HIP. Male- and female-derived primary CTX neurons from rats exposed to prenatal VPA had elevated activity and showed more disorganized firing. In the HIP, only the female VPA neurons showed elevated firing, while the male VPA neurons exhibited disorganized activity. Dendritic arborization of CTX neurons from VPA rats was less complex in both sexes, though this was more pronounced in the females. Conversely, both female and male HIP neurons from VPA rats showed elevated complexity distal to the soma. Female VPA CTX neurons also had an elevated number of dendritic spines. The relative activity of the  and {beta} isoforms of GSK-3 were suppressed in both female and male VPA CTX neurons, with no changes in the HIP neurons. On postnatal day 0, alterations in CTX genes associated with neuropeptides (e.g., penk, pdyn) and receptors (e.g., drd1, adora2a) were seen in both sexes, though they were downregulated in females and upregulated in males.

LimitationsPrimary neuron studies may not recapitulate findings performed in vivo or at later stages of development.

ConclusionTogether these findings suggest that substantial sex differences in neuronal structure and function in the VPA model may have relevance to the reported sex differences in idiopathic ASD.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

The toroidal molecular architecture of the Hfq hexamer contains three well characterised surfaces which allow it to bind sRNAs to stabilise them and engage target transcripts. Hfq-interacting sRNAs are categorised into two classes based on the surfaces they use to bind Hfq. By characterising a systematic alanine mutant library of Hfq to identify amino acid residues that impact survival of Escherichia coli experiencing nitrogen starvation, we corroborated the important role of the three RNA binding surfaces for Hfq function. Surprisingly, we uncovered two conserved residues, V22 and G34, in the hydrophobic core of Hfq, to have a profound impact on Hfqs RNA binding activity in vivo. Transcriptome-scale analysis revealed that V22A and G34A Hfq mutants cause widespread destabilisation of both sRNA classes. However, the alanine substitutions at these residues had no measurable impact on protein stability, structure or equilibrium binding to target sRNAs in vitro. We propose that V22 and G34 are key to the cooperative function among the RNA-binding surfaces of Hfq, a mechanism especially critical under cellular conditions when there is an increased demand for Hfq.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

To enable precision health, it is essential to understand how genetic variants contribute to earlier death or prolonged survival. In this study, we tested the association of common genetic variants and the burden of rare non-synonymous variants in a survival analysis, using age-at-death (N = 35,551, median [min, max] = 72.4 [40.9, 85.2]), and last-known-age (N = 358,282, median [min, max] = 71.9 [52.6, 88.7]), in European ancestry participants of the UK Biobank. The associations we identified seemed predominantly driven by cancer, likely due to the age range of the cohort. Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis. A direction-agnostic (SKAT-O) approach additionally identified significant associations with C1orf52, TERT, IDH2, and RLIM, highlighting a link between telomerase function and longevity as well as identifying additional oncogenic genes.

Our results emphasize the importance of understanding genetic factors driving the most prevalent causes of mortality at a population level, highlighting the potential of early genetic testing to identify germline and somatic variants increasing ones susceptibility to cancer and/or early death.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

Until now, the mechanism of sex determination in cephlaopods has been a mystery. Using a chromosome-level genome assembly generated with long read sequencing, we report the first evidence for genetic sex determination in cephalopods. We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1725833196689

However, only a limited number of clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized so far, from a limited number of regions.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17 of the 26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 429/603 (71.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples from 337 patients. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to clade I, among which 17 were clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (>95%) of the new strains fall within previously described clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows that multiple lineages circulate in a large urban center, indicating separate introduction events.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic is predominated by zoonotic spill-over events involving clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725833196689
