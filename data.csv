Their model predicted 63.3 million cases and 364,000 deaths, with a claimed 95% confidence interval of less than 1% of the estimated values. Objective: To validate the transmission model used by Kayano et al. by simulating infection counts in Japan during 2020 and assessing the impact of errors in the reproduction number of the Delta variant on infection count estimates in the counterfactual scenario. Methods: We replicated the model used by Kayano et al. to simulate infection dynamics in Japan during 2020. We evaluated the model's performance by comparing the simulated infection surges with actual data. Additionally, we analyzed the sensitivity of infection count estimates to {+/-}10% errors in the reproduction number of the Delta variant, corresponding to the 95% confidence interval reported in the cited study. Results: The model successfully reproduced the first infection surge in early 2020, but it failed to replicate the second and third infection surges in the summer and winter of 2020. Sensitivity analysis revealed that a {+/-}10% error in the reproduction number led to an estimated infection count error range of -25% to +42%. Conclusion: The results suggest potential limitations in the validity of the counterfactual simulation results presented by Kayano et al., particularly regarding the accuracy of infection count estimates and the confidence interval.","NA","medrxiv",1739743665950

In contrast to folded proteins, IDRs lack a stable 3D structure and are instead described in terms of a conformational ensemble, a collection of energetically accessible interconverting structures. This unique structural plasticity facilitates diverse molecular recognition and function; thus, a convenient way to view IDRs is through their ensembles. Here, we combine advances in physics-based force fields for IDPs with the power of modern multi-scale generative modeling to develop STARLING, an approach for the rapid and accurate prediction of IDR ensembles directly from sequence. STARLING enables ensembles of hundreds of conformers to be generated in seconds and works on GPUs and CPUs. This, in turn, dramatically lowers the barrier to the computational interrogation of IDR function through the lens of emergent biophysical properties in addition to traditional bioinformatic approaches. We evaluate STARLING's accuracy against experimental data and offer a series of vignettes illustrating how STARLING can enable rapid hypothesis generation for IDR function or the interpretation of experimental data.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

However, the capacity of exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex), present during chronic antigen exposure, to form memory after antigen clearance remains unclear. Here, we performed longitudinal single cell RNA/T cell receptor sequencing and ATAC-sequencing on antigen-specific T cells after the clearance of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. These data revealed the formation of a robust population of memory CD8+ T cells that transcriptionally, epigenetically, and functionally resemble central memory T cells (Tcm) that form after clearance of acute infection. To lineage trace the origin and memory recall response of Tex-derived memory clones, we utilized T cell receptor sequencing over the course of primary infection and rechallenge. We show that chronic Tcm are a clonally distinct lineage of Tex derived from progenitor exhausted cells, persist long-term in the absence of antigen, and undergo rapid clonal expansion during rechallenge. Finally, we demonstrate that PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade after chronic LCMV infection preferentially expands clones which form Tcm after clearance. Together, these data support the concept that chronically stimulated T cells form bona fide functional memory T cells through an analogous differentiation pathway to acutely stimulated T cells, which may have significant implications for enhancing immune memory to cancer through checkpoint blockade and vaccination.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Here, we assess the neutralizing activity of the authorized antibody pemivibart and the candidate antibody SA55 against major historical and currently dominant viral variants, including the JN.1 subvariants KP.3.1.1 and XEC. Our findings show that SA55 demonstrates broad neutralizing potency while pemivibart exhibits reduced neutralizing activity against currently dominant variants. Then we employ replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus with the JN.1 spike (rVSV{Delta}G-JN.1) to select escape variants of SA55. Following this, we conduct a systematic comparison of escape profiles for these two antibodies, revealing that SA55 is remarkably resilient to escape mutations under antibody selection, which is consistent with our SPR data indicating that SA55 possesses a substantially stronger binding affinity. Moreover, an immunobridging analysis suggests that SA55 may have superior clinical efficacy to pemivibart in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection under the current variant landscape. Together, this work highlights the promise of SA55 as a potential therapeutic option in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised populations.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

We find rapid evolution of genome architecture, including ~100 Mb variation in genome size driven by dynamic satellite landscapes with unexpectedly long (> 10 kb) repeat units and widespread variation in gene content, influencing gene expression. SVs exhibit slightly deleterious dynamics modulated by variant length and population size, with strong evidence of adaptive fixation only in large populations.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mrx6 belongs to the Pet20-domain-containing protein family, consisting of Mrx6, Pet20, and Sue1. Notably, absence of Mrx6 leads to increased mtDNA copy number. Here, we identify the C-terminus of Mrx6 as essential for its stability and interaction with the mitochondrial matrix protein Mam33. Deletion of Mam33 mimics the effect of Mrx6 loss, resulting in elevated mtDNA copy number. Bioinformatics, mutational analyses, and immunoprecipitation studies reveal that a subcomplex of Mam33 and Mrx6 trimers interacts with the substrate recognition domain of the conserved mitochondrial Lon protease Pim1 through a bipartite motif in the Pet20 domain of Mrx6. Loss of Mrx6, its paralog Pet20, Mam33, or mutations disrupting the interaction between Mrx6 and Pim1 stabilize key proteins required for mtDNA maintenance, the RNA polymerase Rpo41 and the HMG-box-containing protein Cim1. We propose that Mrx6, alongside Pet20 and Mam33, regulates mtDNA copy number by modulating substrate degradation through Pim1. Additionally, Mrx6 loss alters Cim1's function, preventing the detrimental effect on mtDNA maintenance observed upon Cim1 overexpression. The presence of three Pet20-domain proteins in yeast implies broader roles of Lon protease substrate recognition beyond mtDNA regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

While the design and modeling of peptides in general has seen rapid advances since the advent of modern machine learning methods, existing deep learning models cannot effectively predict cyclic peptide structures containing non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), which are often crucial for peptide therapeutics. To address this limitation, we here extend the recent AF3-style model Boltz to cyclic peptides with ncAAs. In addition to the positional encoding offset, we used a simple yet effective extension of the cyclic offset encoding based on AlphaFold3 tokenization scheme that allows the modeling of cyclic peptides with modified residues. On a test set of peptides with ncAAs, our approach outperforms HighFold2 on 13/17 cases, with an average C RMSD of 1.877[A] and an average all-atom RMSD of 3.361[A]. Our results show that the cyclic offset encoding shown for AlphaFold2 generalizes to AlphaFold3-based models and can be extended to incorporate ncAAs, showing potential in the design of novel cyclic peptides with ncAAs for therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

The simultaneous in vitro synthesis of minimal yet sufficient tRNA species (at least 21) poses a challenge for constructing a self-reproducible artificial cell. A key obstacle is the processing of the 5' and 3' ends, which requires a multi-step reaction in natural cells. In this study, we developed a simplified processing method that allows simultaneous expression of all 21 tRNAs in a reconstituted transcription/translation system (PURE system). We tested three available methods (leader, 5'-G variants, and HDVR attachment methods) and one new method (direct tRNA linkage method). Using these methods, we succeeded in simultaneous expression of six non-G-start tRNA from monocistronic six DNA templates in the PURE system. Furthermore, we developed a method that combines the direct tRNA linkage and HDVR attachment methods (termed tRNA array method). Using this method, we succeeded in simultaneous expression of all 21 tRNAs from a single polycistronic DNA template in the PURE system. The tRNA mixture produced by the tRNA array method supported a similar level of translation to the individually synthesized tRNA mixture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the minimal tRNA sets prepared by the tRNA array method can be used for genetic code engineering. This study represents a step toward the realization of self-reproducible artificial cells and also provides an easy method for preparing all tRNAs useful for genetic code engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

MEG scans demonstrated substantial preservation of neural activity across multiple brain regions in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls following viral challenge. This approach not only underscores the role of vaccination in mitigating severe neurological outcomes but also highlights the capability of MEG to detect subtle yet significant changes in brain function that may be overlooked by other imaging modalities. These findings advance our understanding of vaccine-induced neuroprotection and establish MEG as a powerful tool for monitoring brain function in the context of viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Here, to explore hyperparasitism in Archaea, we focused on ultra-small archaea of the phylum Nanohaloarchaeota, a distinct lineage within the DPANN superphylum, which establish obligate symbiotic interactions with extreme halophiles of the class Halobacteria. We assembled five metagenomes originating from geothermally influenced salt lakes in the Danakil Depression, Ethiopia, and reconstructed the viromes associated with both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea. Both archaeal lineages were associated with viruses from four distinct groups, including head-tailed viruses (class Caudoviricetes), tailless icosahedral viruses, pleomorphic viruses and spindle-shaped viruses, which represent 12 previously undescribed families. The haloarchaeal viruses (HVs) and nanohaloarchaeal viruses (NHVs) are only distantly related, suggesting that viruses from the four groups co-evolved with their respective hosts for an extended period, likely since the divergence of the two archaeal lineages from their last common ancestor. Consistently, our results show that HVs and NHVs are well-adapted to replicate in their respective hosts and to thrive in hypersaline environments. No evidence of host switching between haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea was obtained, but multiple horizontal transfers of genes implicated in virion structure and morphogenesis between HVs and NHVs were detected. We also identified several NHVs-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes implicated in nucleotide and amino acid metabolisms, which could enhance the metabolic capabilities of the nanohaloarchaeal hosts that have highly reduced genomes. Finally, in addition to HVs and NHVs, we describe plasmid-derived virus satellites that appear to have originated convergently to parasitize spindle-shaped viruses of both haloarchaea and nanohaloarchaea, uncovering an additional layer of parasitism. Collectively, our findings fill the knowledge gap on the diversity of HVs and NHVs, highlight the complexity of virus-host and virus-virus interactions in hypersaline environments, and open doors for further mining of the virosphere of the globally distributed DPANN archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Here, we introduce a deep model to generate a person's entire connectome exclusively based on their age, sex, body phenotypes, cognition, and lifestyle factors. Using the richly phenotyped UK Biobank connectome cohort (N=8,086), we demonstrate that our model can generate network architectures that closely recapitulate connectomes mapped empirically using diffusion MRI and tractography. We find that age, sex, and body phenotypes exert the strongest influence on the connectome generation process, with an impact approximately four times greater than that of cognition and lifestyle factors. Regional differences in the importance of measures were observed, including an increased importance of cognition in the association cortex relative to the visual system. We further show that generated connectomes can improve the training of machine learning models and reduce their predictive errors. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of inferring brain connectivity from an individual's personal data and enables future applications of connectome generation such as data augmentation and anonymous data sharing.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

In this study, we created a mouse model of PD by overexpressing -synuclein through a combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the medial and lateral substantia nigra (SN). We also demonstrated that chronic administration of the c-Abl inhibitor PD180970 provides neuroprotection in this model. Mice injected with the AAV6--synuclein and PFF combination showed a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN and their projections in the striatum over 24 weeks. This neuronal loss coincided with a time-dependent accumulation of phosphorylated -synuclein (p-syn) in the SN. The p-syn aggregates spread to synaptically connected DARPP-32-positive neurons in the striatum and further extended to the cortex. We also observed a contralateral spread of p-syn aggregates. Additionally, -synuclein overexpression led to a significant increase in activated microglia and astrocytes at all timepoints, with the strongest activation occurring early and gradually diminishing over time. Daily administration of PD180970 significantly reduced the loss of DA neurons caused by -synuclein injection and decreased the accumulation of p-syn in the SN. PD180970 treatment also reduced the neuroinflammation significantly. Overall, the combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils into the mouse brain establishes a robust PD model, enabling detailed mechanistic studies of the disease. We further demonstrate the model's utility for chronic neuroprotection studies using the potential drug PD180970, highlighting its broad applicability.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Chronic- restraint stress (CRS) and ethanol intake are independently known to induce changes in brain structure and function, however, their combined effects on neurodevelopment over long periods of time remains largely unexplored. We conducted an in vivo longitudinal rat model with three main goals. 1) to determine if chronic stress increases ethanol intake; 2) to determine the effect of chronic- stress and ethanol intake in behavioral measures, brain structure, and function; and 3) to investigate the effect of sex. This observational study included Wistar rats assigned to four groups: 1) ethanol consumption (EtOH+/CRS-), 2) stress exposure (EtOH-/CRS+), 3) both ethanol and stress exposure (EtOH+/CRS+), and 4) control group (EtOH-/CRS-). Our results showed that chronic stress did not affect ethanol intake but led to reduced body weight gain, elevated corticosterone levels, and impaired recognition memory. Structural MRI revealed that both exposures produced additive brain volume changes in regions such as the olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics identified disrupted cortical-subcortical connections. Results found here were sex-dependent in terms of volumetric changes (higher effects on males) and functional connectivity (higher effects on females). Findings suggest sex-dependent mechanisms where both chronic- ethanol intake and stress affect brain plasticity during neurodevelopment. Understanding these region-specific vulnerabilities is crucial for addressing alcohol use disorders and stress-related neuropathology.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Residents of Sydney have reported increasing cases of bin-opening behavior by sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), with evidence this behavior is socially learned between birds. Households protected their bins, yet cockatoos have learned to defeat these defences. In response, residents increase their defence-level, setting the stage for a behavioral ""arms race"". Here, we investigate this arms race by combining field observations with agent-based modeling. We systematically document protections in a suburban locality over two years, revealing spatial clustering of protections indicative of social learning among residents. We find that protections have decreased since 2019, and overly-costly protection is dispreferred. With a controlled assay, we characterize the knowledge of local cockatoos, finding differential proficiency in defeating protections. Surprisingly, we identified several cockatoos that can defeat high-efficacy protections, such as locks. Finally, we simulate interactions between two populations of learning agents representing households and cockatoos. We find that social learning accelerates adaptation in both species, while coordination reduces costs associated with defensive escalation.

To address this, we performed genome-wide CRISPR knockout and focused base editor screens in PPP perturbed conditions to establish a high-resolution functional map of PPP regulation that pinpoints novel regulatory mechanisms. Through this, we identify the orphan reductase CYB5R4 as an evolutionarily conserved activator of PP4 and PP6, but not the closely related PP2A. Heme binding is essential for CYB5R4 function and mechanistically involves the reduction of the metal ions in the active site. Importantly, CYB5R4-mediated activation of PP4 is critical for cell viability when cells are treated with DNA damage-inducing agents known to cause oxidative stress. The discovery of a dedicated PPP reductase points to shared regulatory principles with protein tyrosine phosphatases, where specific enzymes dictate activity by regulating the active site redox state. In sum, our work provides a resource for understanding PPP function and the regulation of intracellular signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Understanding the neural mechanism of cognitive reserve could help assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of interventions in AD. To address this, here, 38 elderly participants performed a sustained attention task during high-density EEG while awake and during drowsiness. Operationally, the degree to which performance was impaired under drowsiness signalled the extent of cognitive reserve, with less impairment indicating a higher level of cognitive reserve. Investigating performance variations during the active management of neural challenges offers a novel approach to studying cognitive reserve, capturing dynamics that mirror everyday cognitive demand. We related cognitive reserve to various measures, including informational complexity using the Lempel-Ziv (LZSUM) algorithm. We found a significant interaction effect between arousal and performance, where LZSUM values increased in high performers when drowsy but decreased in low performers. This effect was most pronounced in the frontal and central areas. Our findings suggest LZSUM to be indicative of a compensatory mechanism and thus show potential for LZSUM as a neural marker in assessing cognitive reserve. However, we found no consistent relationship between performance and structural brain measures, and proxies of cognitive reserve. Critically, our findings present a counterexample to the prevailing view that informational complexity purely reflects conscious level. Further research, such as a study with the same paradigm in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may lead to additional insights of whether we are truly measuring cognitive reserve.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

This genetic variation is vital for populations to adapt to their environments, but it is also surprising given that nature (after all) ''selects'' the best genotypes at the expense of those that fall short. Explaining the extensive genetic variation of fitness-related traits is thus a longstanding puzzle in evolutionary biology, with cascading implications for ecology, conservation, and human health. Balancing selection--an umbrella term for scenarios of natural selection that maintain genetic variation--is a century-old explanation to resolve this paradox that has gained recent momentum from genome-scale methods for detecting it. Yet evaluating whether balancing selection can, in fact, resolve the paradox is challenging, given the logistical constraints of distinguishing balancing selection from alternative hypotheses and the daunting collection of theoretical models that formally underpin this debate. Here, we track the development of balancing selection theory over the last century and provide an accessible review of this rich collection of models. We first outline the range of biological scenarios that can generate balancing selection. We then examine how fundamental features of genetic systems--including non-random mating between individuals, differences in ploidy, genetic drift, and different genetic architectures of traits--have been progressively incorporated into the theory. We end by linking these theoretical predictions to ongoing empirical efforts to understand the evolutionary processes that explain genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

IMPACC participants who experienced LC had lower recovery factor scores compared to participants without LC. Biologic characterization revealed increased levels of plasma proteins associated with inflammation, elevated transcriptional signatures of heme metabolism, and decreased androgenic steroids in LC patients. The recovery factor was also associated with altered circulating immune cell frequencies. Notably, recovery factor scores were predictive of LC occurrence in patients as early as hospital admission, irrespective of acute disease severity.

Sources of somatic mutations include imperfect DNA repair, replication errors, and exogenous damage such as ultraviolet radiation. A previous study estimated a surprisingly low number of somatic mutations in a 234-year-old individual of the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), known as the Napoleon Oak. It has been suggested that the true number of somatic mutations was underestimated due to gaps in the reference genome and too conservative filtering of potential mutations. We therefore generated new high-fidelity long-read data for the Napoleon Oak (n = 12) to produce both a pseudo-haploid genome assembly and a partially phased diploid assembly. The high heterozygosity allowed for complete reconstruction of phased and gapless centromeres for 22 of the 24 chromosomes. On the other hand, the high heterozygosity posed challenges for short-read alignments. Use of only the pseudo-haploid assembly as a reference led to potential misalignments, while use of only the diploid assembly reduced variant detection sensitivity. Since most somatic mutations are layer-specific, the observed frequency is expected relatively low, even where all cells in a single layer contain a specific mutation. To address this challenge, we employed a read assignment strategy, selecting the appropriate reference sequence (pseudo-haploid or diploid) based on alignment score and mapping quality. Ultimately, we identified 198 high-confidence somatic mutations, compared with 17 somatic mutations identified before with the same set of short reads. Our approach thus increased the total estimated annual mutation rate by a factor of five.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

However, the drivers of these effects intracellularly remain unclear. Here, in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that loss of coordinated inter-organelle dynamics causally initiates metabolic inflexibility with age. In young animals, peroxisomes emerge as the priming orchestrators of the fasting response, simultaneously governing lipid droplets (LDs) utilization and mitochondrial bioenergetics. With age, peroxisomal priming is lost, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired dynamic nutrient responses during fasting. Notably, dietary restriction (DR) exerts a rejuvenating effect on peroxisomal function, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity and promoting longevity. Our study uncovers the expansive network of organelles enabling lipid mobilization during youth, providing critical context to the poorly understood role of peroxisomes in actively maintaining organelle homeodynamics and metabolic flexibility throughout the aging process.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Here we introduce, POLEGON, a novel approach for estimating branch lengths for ARGs which uses an uninformative prior. Using extensive simulations, we show that this method provides improved estimates of coalescence times and lead to more accurate inferences of effective population sizes under a wide range of demographic assumptions. It also improves other downstream inferences including estimates of mutation rates.

Although the frequency of P values near the 0.05 threshold has declined modestly, this likely reflects increases in statistical power rather than decreases in P hacking.","NA","medrxiv",1739743665950

We investigate the likelihood of evolutionary rescue on a mutator background that either emerges de novo or pre-exists in the population prior to a severe environmental change. If such an evolutionary rescue event occurs, the mutator lineage sweeps into the population, and thus the environmental stress has promoted mutators. Our findings indicate that mutation rate evolution can substantially boost rescue probabilities, but stronger mutators are most effective when the wildtype has a low mutation rate, while their advantage diminishes for higher wildtype mutation rates. Interestingly, at intermediate wildtype mutation rates, emerging mutators can be almost equally likely to sweep no matter how slowly or quickly the environment changes. However, at low wildtype mutation rates, mutators are only likely to sweep for very slow environmental changes due to the sequential nature of necessary mutations for such sweeps to occur. Finally, we show that pre-existing mutators can be significantly more likely to rescue the population compared to the wildtype, provided the wildtype's mutation rate is relatively low. This research opens new avenues for investigating mutator dynamics in response to environmental stress.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Both neutralising activity and effector function activity of Spike-specific antibodies have been shown to be important for their protective and therapeutic activity. However, several recent studies have reported that vaccination with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines can lead to elevated levels of Spike-specific IgG4, an isotype which is often considered anti-inflammatory due to its reduced binding to Fc{gamma} receptors on immune cells. Here we show that the level of Spike-specific IgG4 produced following BNT162b2 vaccination is impacted by the interval between and frequency of vaccines boosts, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (hybrid immunity), breakthrough infection and bivalent vaccine boosters. Despite the increase in Spike-specific IgG4 between the 2nd and 3rd BNT162b2 vaccine dose, neutralisation, ADCD and ADCP activity all increased. Through expression of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies cloned as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, we demonstrated that whilst Spike-specific IgG4 had reduced effector function activity, including ADCC, ADCD and ADCP, IgG4 was only inhibitory when directly competing with functional IgG subclasses binding to an overlapping epitope. In the context of polyclonal plasma, ADCC and ADCD activity could not be depleted by addition of high concentrations of a Spike-specific IgG4 mAb cocktail suggesting the non-stimulatory effect of Spike-specific IgG4 may be hidden in more complex scenarios, such as polyclonal mixes in serum.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Similar to advancements in AI for other scientific fields, deeper research into biological LLMs has begun to focus on using these models to rediscover important existing biological laws or uncover entirely new patterns in biological sequences. This study leverages GPT-like LLMs to utilize language transfer capabilities to rediscover the genetic code rules of the central dogma. In our experimental design, we transformed the central dogma into a binary classification problem of aligning DNA sequences with protein sequences, where positive examples are matching DNA and protein sequences, and negative examples are non-matching pairs. We first trained a GPT-2 model from scratch using a dataset comprising protein sequences, DNA sequences, and sequences from languages such as English and Chinese. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the model using the English similarity judgment dataset from PAWS-X. When tested on a dataset for DNA and protein sequence alignment judgment, the fine-tuned model achieved a classification accuracy of 76%. The study also analyzed factors contributing to this zero-shot capability, including model training stability and types of training data. This research demonstrates that LLMs can, through the transfer of natural language capabilities and solely relying on the analysis of sequences themselves, rediscover the central dogma without prior knowledge of it.

The tropical bont tick, Amblyomma variegatum, is a significant natural vector of Ehrlichia ruminantium, the causative agent of heartwater. This disease is endemic in many countries, including those in sub-Saharan Africa and certain Caribbean islands. Due to the potential of heartwater and its vector to pose an economic and health threats to non-endemic regions, they have been designated as high-consequence foreign animal diseases and pests by the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Understanding the ecology and biology of A. variegatum is critical for developing effective control methods to limit its spread to other geographic regions. A key step in this process is the isolation of tick organs and further elucidation of their functions (i.e. vector competence). However, the literature contains limited documentation of the complete internal structure of Amblyomma tick species. In this study, we describe the internal structure of unfed nymphs, partially engorged males, and unfed and partially engorged females of the tick species A. variegatum. The objective is to facilitate the identification and the localization organs of interest while highlighting the morphological differences between the tropical bont tick and other tick species. This foundational work will support the development of various applications following the isolation of tick organs.

In a previous study, we showed that oligomers of A{beta}1-42 (oA{beta}1-42) induced PM damage, resulting in PM repair cascade via lysosomal exocytosis coupled with endocytosis, and facilitation of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs)-like membrane protrusions to promote direct cell-to-cell transfer of aggregates. In this study, we demonstrated that PM damage induced by oligomers of the aggregation-prone peptide A{beta}1-42 significantly facilitates PM repair by enhancing phosphorylated p21-activated kinase 1 (pPAK1)-dependent endocytosis and Rab3a-dependent exocytosis in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH neuronal cells compared to control and oA{beta}1-40 treated cells. We studied the kinetics of pPAK1-dependent endocytosis and the fusion of EGFP-Rab3a vesicles near the PM using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. IPA-3, a selective non-ATP competitive inhibitor of PAK1, inhibits endocytosis of oA{beta} peptides and Rab3a-dependent PM repair. Further, shRNA-mediated knockdown of the Rab3a gene inhibits pPAK1 and disrupts PM repair. Repair of damaged PM is a vital protective mechanism for non-proliferative cells like neurons, as disruption in PM repair leads to gradual neuronal cell death.

However, computational deconvolution of cfDNA remains challenging due to the complexity of methylation data, the diverse cellular compositions in cfDNA mixtures, and the limited interpretability of current methods. We present cfDecon, an efficient deep-learning framework for cfDNA deconvolution at the resolution of individual reads. cfDecon employs a multichannel autoencoder core module and an iterative refinement process to estimate cell-type proportions and generate condition-aware cell-type-specific methylation profiles. We rigorously evaluate cfDecon through comprehensive simulation experiments, including scenarios with normal cellular compositions, rare cell types, and unknown cell types, where cfDecon consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in deconvolution. Using strict data separation and careful control for potential data leakage, cfDecon shows scalability and applicability to large-scale studies by raising Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over 33% on an atlas-level reference dataset. We further validate cfDecon's utility in disease diagnosis on two clinical datasets, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). cfDecon raises the performance of disease detection from 0.53 to 0.79 compared to existing methods on the ALS dataset and 0.55 to 0.77 on the HCC dataset. The capacity of cfDecon to predict condition-specific DNA methylation patterns across cell types offers a valuable framework for studying differentially methylated CpGs. Furthermore, integrating cfDecon with enrichment analysis facilitates the exploration of functional variations in CpGs across different conditions. cfDecon represents a significant advancement in cfDNA analysis, offering improved accuracy, interpretability, and potential for personalized medicine applications.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Thus, we hypothesized that sensitivity to CDK2 inhibition is linked to the absence of this CDK4/6-mediated compensatory mechanism. Here we show that Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancers often co-express the tumor suppressor p16, which inhibits CDK4/6. We show that ovarian cancer cells expressing p16 exhibit heightened sensitivity to CDK2 inhibitors and that depletion of p16 renders them significantly more resistant. Multiplexed immunofluorescence of 225 ovarian patient tumors reveals that at least 18% of tumors express high Cyclin E1 and high p16, a group that we expect to be particularly sensitive to CDK2 inhibition.

Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequent molecular event in this malignancy. p53 inactivation occurs either through TP53 mutations in HPV-negative cases or via HPV-mediated p53 degradation in HPV-positive (HPV+) cases, where most retain a wild-type (WT) TP53 allele. This underscores the critical role of p53-regulated processes in HNSCC pathogenesis. Clinically, HPV+ HNSCC is associated with significantly better outcomes than HPV-negative cases. Despite HPV E6-mediated degradation of p53, 10% of HPV+ HNSCC cases have mutant TP53 alleles, suggesting an additional need to suppress p53 signaling. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV+ TP53-WT HNSCC cells have residual p53 activity, with tumor-suppressive effects. Specifically, ablation of p53 in HPV+ TP53-WT HNSCC cells lead to increased proliferation, migration, and invasion. RNA-sequencing revealed that p53 regulates gene transcription (both activation and repression) in the presence of HPV, and we confirmed that these functions are p53-specific. Human tumor data further reveal that among HPV+ HNSCC cases, those with WT TP53 have significantly better survival outcomes than HPV+ cases with TP53 mutations. Notably, HPV+ TP53-WT HNSCC tumors show decreased PI3K-AKT signaling, increased gene methylation in oncogenic pathways, and fewer chromosomal alterations compared to HPV+ TP53-mutant tumors. These findings challenge the prevailing notion that p53 is entirely inactivated in HPV+ HNSCC and provide critical insights into HNSCC-specific, p53-driven tumor suppression mechanisms with implications for targeted therapies in HNSCC.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

We generated and tested three predictors for the degree of cross-tolerance, based on the similarity between pairs of metal environments in (1) their physiochemical properties, (2) the overlap in genes known to impact tolerance to both metals, and (3) their co-occurrence in the environment. None of these predictors explained significant variation in cross-tolerance. Instead, we observed that adapted lines in one metal were frequently cross-tolerant to certain metals (manganese and nickel) and intolerant to others (cobalt and zinc). Furthermore, cross-tolerance between pairs of metals was not reciprocal, with mutations accumulating in one metal (e.g., copper) providing adaptation to another metal (e.g., manganese), but not vice versa. Evolved lines also differed in their degree of specialization, with lines evolved in manganese or copper more specialized to that metal, but lines evolved in cobalt or zinc more generally tolerant. To determine the genetic basis of these metal adaptations, we sequenced the genomes of 109 metal-adapted yeast lines. The SNP mutation spectrum was significantly different in cadmium, cobalt, and manganese than expected in a mutation accumulation experiment in S. cerevisiae. In addition, two lines were highly mutated, bearing defects in DNA repair genes (both in manganese). Thirteen genes exhibited parallel adaptation to different metals; three of these genes generated broad cross-tolerance. Several mutations were found in vacuolar transporter genes, suggesting an important role for vacuolar proteins in adapting to metal stress. Our results with these metal-adapted lines indicate that cross-tolerance is challenging to predict, depending on the combined stressors experienced and the nature of the mutations involved.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Droplet-based barcoding technology allows sample multiplexing, thereby facilitating high-scale of single cell sequencing. The resulting processing complexity, sample contamination and the underlying chemistries can all contribute to cell mis-labelling and consequent spurious cell-to-sample assignment. Approaches for barcode-free de-multiplexing which leverage natural genetic variation have been developed, but generally require an external source of genotype information. Results We propose a novel method to exploit genome imputation and clustering to assign cells to inferred donor groups in the absence of a priori genetic information. Using tumor-derived single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, our workflow successfully assigned individual cells to donor-of-origin with high concordance. Conclusions This imputation-clustering approach represents a quality-assessment and quality-control strategy for barcode-free single cell donor-origin deconvolution with the capacity to resolve cases of sample cross-contamination.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

In conversations, comprehension and production processes are intertwined, as speakers soon become listeners, and listeners become speakers. Nonetheless, the neural systems underlying these faculties are typically studied in isolation using paradigms that cannot fully engage our capacity for interactive communication. Here, we used an fMRI hyperscanning paradigm to measure neural activity simultaneously in pairs of subjects engaged in real-time, interactive conversations. We used contextual word embeddings from a large language model to quantify the linguistic coupling between production and comprehension systems within and across individual brains. We found a highly overlapping network of regions involved in both production and comprehension spanning much of the cortical language network. Our findings reveal that shared representations for both processes extend beyond the language network into areas associated with social cognition. Together, these results suggest that the specialized neural systems for speech perception and production align on a common set of linguistic features encoded in a broad cortical network for language and communication.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Using complementary reporter mouse models, CCL2-mCherry to label CCL2-producing cells, and CCR2-CRE/mKate2 marking CCR2 expressing monocytes, we demonstrated that RELMa-positive perivascular macrophages secrete CCL2 to recruit monocytes predominantly to the synovial interstitium at the onset of antigen-induced arthritis. The inflamed synovial environment guides the differentiation of the recruited monocytes into tissue-resident macrophages, including but not limited to macrophages expressing VSIG4, a characteristic marker of lining macrophages. Thus, RELMa-positive macrophages orchestrate monocyte recruitment to the synovium during articular inflammation, contributing to a local replenishment of synovial lining macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Targeting the parasites invasion mechanisms offers a promising therapeutic strategy. In this study, we leveraged a novel agentic foundational model, Moremi Bio Agent, to design monoclonal antibodies targeting the AMA1-RON2 complex, a critical component in the parasite's invasion of human red blood cells. Using advanced structural modeling, we generated 999 antibodies, which were evaluated for binding affinity, structural integrity, and physicochemical properties. Binding affinity analysis using PRODIGY identified 864 antibodies with successful target interactions, exhibiting binding free energies ranging from -116.8 kcal/mol to -5.6 kcal/mol. The strongest candidates demonstrated exceptionally tight binding, with dissociation constants in the femtomolar to attomolar range, indicative of highly stable interactions. Additionally, structural validation confirmed that the antibodies were thermodynamically stable with robust fold reliability, essential for functional efficacy. Epitope mapping revealed highly conserved regions within the target complex, enhancing the likelihood of cross-strain efficacy. Glycosylation analysis identified key sites that could improve antibody stability and immune recognition, while BLAST comparison with known therapeutic antibodies demonstrated significant homology, underscoring their potential for clinical development. This study highlights the power of generative AI-driven computational pipelines in antibody discovery, providing a scalable and cost-effective framework for therapeutic development. The findings establish a foundation for experimental validation and optimization, with the potential to advance novel interventions against malaria and other infectious diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

We do this based on a series of piecemeal GWASs of segments of a target (continuous) trait distribution, and the genetic correlations between those GWASs and a second trait. Simulations confirm that we are able to retrieve the shape of the relationship given certain assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the traits. We applied the method to the genetic relationship between BMI, sleep duration, and height, and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and depression) using data from approximately 450K individuals from UK Biobank. In the relationship between BMI and psychiatric traits, we found that the expected value of depression is a nonlinear function of BMI i.e. there is a nonlinear genetic relationship between both traits. We observed similar findings for the genetic relationship between BMI and anorexia, sleep duration and depression, and sleep duration and ADHD. We observed no underlying nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between height and psychiatric traits. Using a novel statistical approach, we show that nonlinear genetic relationships between traits are detectable and genetic associations as quantified using global estimators like genetic correlations are not informative about underlying complexities in these relationships. Our findings challenge assumptions of linearity in genetic epidemiology and suggest that bivariate genetic associations are not uniform across the phenotypic spectrum, which may have implications for the development of targeted interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Many redundant muscle patterns can solve a given task, and this high dimensionality allows flexibility but poses a problem for efficient learning 4. Although a feasible solution invokes subcortical innate motor patterns, or primitives, to reduce the dimensionality of the control problem, how cortex learns to utilize such primitives remains an open question 5-7. To address this, we studied cortical and subcortical interactions as head-fixed mice learned contextual control of innate hindlimb extension behavior. Naive mice performed reactive extensions to turn off a cold air stimulus within seconds and, using predictive cues, learned to avoid the stimulus altogether in tens of trials. Optogenetic inhibition of large areas of rostral cortex completely prevented avoidance behavior, but did not impair hindlimb extensions in reaction to the cold air stimulus. Remarkably, mice covertly learned to avoid the cold stimulus even without any prior experience of successful, cortically-mediated avoidance. These findings support a dynamic, heterarchical model in which the dominant locus of control can change, on the order of seconds, between cortical and subcortical brain areas. We propose that cortex can leverage periods when subcortex predominates as demonstrations, to learn parameterized control of innate behavioral primitives.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

To investigate how animals perceive these intermittent cues, we developed a behavioral task in which head-restrained mice made binary decisions based on the total number of discrete odor pulses presented stochastically over several seconds. Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation. Our study reveals that mice can integrate intermittent odor signals across dozens of breaths, but respiratory modulation of sensory inputs imposes limits on information acquisition that cortical circuits cannot overcome to improve behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

Nascent proteins can begin to fold on their parent ribosome but formation of the native state is often inhibited well beyond the emergence of the necessary residues from the exit tunnel. The dominant forces driving this apparent destabilisation have remained unclear. We investigate this here, combining NMR experiments and atomistic simulations of a folded nascent chain on and off the ribosome. While its native structure and internal dynamics remain unaltered, co-translational folding is disfavoured due to intermolecular electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged ribosome surface and nascent protein. Partially folded intermediates are less destabilised, resulting in their high populations. Specifically, we show that the polypeptide's net charge is the dominant factor determining nascent folding thermodynamics, with smaller contributions from charge distribution. Consequently, positively charged proteins can fold on the ribosome without populating stable intermediates. These findings reconcile conflicting observations of previous studies and establish the general physical principles underpinning de novo protein folding.","NA","biorxiv",1739743665950

However, the field currently lacks consistently curated datasets with accurate labels, especially for non-coding variants, that are necessary to comprehensively benchmark these models and advance the field. In this work, we present TraitGym, a curated dataset of regulatory genetic variants that are either known to be causal or are strong candidates across 113 Mendelian and 83 complex traits, along with carefully constructed control variants. We frame the causal variant prediction task as a binary classification problem and benchmark various models, including functional-genomics-supervised models, self-supervised models, models that combine machine learning predictions with curated annotation features, and ensembles of these.

One physiological change during the vertebrate stress response is the release of glucocorticoid hormones. Here, we measured plasma corticosterone in female domesticated budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to test whether human presence, restraint, or removal and return of a newly stressed neighbor increases corticosterone. The presence of humans for 15 minutes at the beginning of the experiment did not significantly elevate corticosterone above baseline levels, suggesting that birds that acclimate to humans are minimally affected by their presence. However, at the end of the experiment after multiple blood sampling events, the same human presence test significantly elevated corticosterone above baseline and human presence levels measured at the beginning of the experiment. Thus, repeated blood sampling could cause progressively stronger stress responses to human presence. Restraint-induced corticosterone levels were significantly higher than all other treatments, indicating that human handling activates the stress response. After stressed birds were returned home, corticosterone levels of their neighbors were significantly higher than baseline at 25- and 45-minutes post-return. However, the 25- and 45-minute corticosterone levels were not significantly different from each other, or levels induced by human presence at the beginning or end of the experiment. This outcome suggests that social transmission of stress was limited across the sampled time frame. These data highlight the importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of different human-animal interactions in captivity, including in domesticated species that are more tolerant of forced proximity to humans.
