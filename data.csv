Across species, cooperative behaviors are often organized by distinct social roles such as leaders and followers, yet the neural mechanisms supporting such role-based coordination remain elusive. Here we introduce a new paradigm for studying cooperation in mice, where pairs of animals engage in a joint spatial foraging task that naturally gives rise to stable leader-follower roles predictive of learning speed. Disruption of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity, particularly in followers, impairs cooperation and induces reciprocal shifts in how animals weigh self- and partner-related cues for decision-making. Calcium imaging reveals that mPFC encodes both leadership dynamics and an egocentric social value map of the partners position, each in an asymmetric, role-specific manner. Combining this behavior with a novel multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning framework, we identify latent value functions that guide cooperative decisions and are decodable from mPFC activity. These findings uncover fundamental neural computations that support cooperation, revealing how social roles shape decision-making in real time. Our work opens new avenues for investigating the cellular and circuit basis of social cognition and collective behavior.","[{""name"":""Alfred P.

Remote sensing technologies such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) now enable the 3D mapping of entire landscapes. However, we lack the large, harmonized and geographically representative ALS collections needed to build a global picture of woody ecosystem structure. To address this challenge, we developed the Global Canopy Atlas (GCA): 3,458 standardized and analysis-ready maps of canopy height and elevation at 1 m2 resolution derived from high-resolution ALS acquisitions. The GCA covers 56,554 km2 across all major biomes. Of its acquisitions 19% of have been scanned multiple times and 87% are publicly available, covering 95% of the total area. To showcase its wide range of applications, we applied the GCA in three case studies. First, we validated three global satellite-derived canopy height maps, finding poor performance at native resolution (1-30 m, R2 < 0.38) and moderate performance at 250 m resolution (R2 < 0.65). Second, analyzing global patterns in canopy gap size frequency we discovered an unexpectedly large variation of power law exponents from branch to stand level ( = 1.52 to 2.38), pointing to fundamental scale-dependencies of forest structure. Third, we developed a framework to standardize forest turnover quantification from multi-temporal ALS. Applied to repeat acquisitions in a temperate forest in North America, it revealed that 21% of canopy gaps closed within 12 years of opening and would thus be missed by infrequent monitoring. As demonstrated by these case studies, the GCA provides a novel data source for ecologists, foresters, remote sensing scientists and the ecosystem modelling community that substantially advances our ability to understand the structure and dynamics of woody ecosystems at global scales.","[{""name"":""Leverhulme

Here, we demonstrate that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus promoted lung tumor progression by reprogramming the local immune landscape. Retrospective clinical analysis revealed that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 exhibited increased lung cancer incidence. Using multiple murine lung cancer models, we show that prior severe respiratory viral infections accelerated tumor growth and reduced survival. Mechanistically, prior viral pneumonia epigenetically remodeled the lung to establish a pro-tumor microenvironment, including the local accumulation of SiglecFhi tumor-associated neutrophils, a transcriptionally reprogrammed, immunosuppressive population whose signature predicted poor prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma. In parallel, epithelial compartments exhibited altered differentiation trajectories, with persistence of injury-associated alveolar intermediates positioned along tumorigenic lineages. We observe sustained chromatin remodeling at key cytokine loci in immune and structure cells, linking inflammatory memory to persistent immune suppression. Therapeutically, combined inhibition of neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 and PD-L1 signaling restored CD8 T cell infiltration and suppressed tumor growth. Together, our findings establish a direct causal relationship between viral pneumonia, including COVID-19, and lung tumorigenesis, highlighting the urgent need to monitor survivors for elevated cancer risk and to develop targeted interventions and therapies aimed at preventing potential cancer bursts in COVID-19 convalescents.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI147394, AG069264, AI112844, HL170961, AI176171 and AG090337;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Here we show that two major lineages of fungi, Glomeromycotina and Microsporidia, lost DNA polymerase complexes involved in replication and translesion synthesis. Catalytic and non-catalytic subunits of DNA polymerases are co-eliminated, consistent with their physical and functional interactions described in other eukaryotes. We detect lineage-specific variation in genome-wide mutation rates, showing that DNA polymerase gene losses correlate with increased genetic variation. We find that the Glomeraceae family of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi has lived for [~]360 My without a leading strand replisome, raising the question of how these fungi can replicate DNA. We provide evidence that the cell cycle of Rhizophagus irregularis is active when in symbiosis with a host, but not without. This indicates a higher level of integration between AM fungi and plants than previously appreciated, and suggests the existence of a regulatory or functional contribution provided by a host to the fungal cell cycle. We propose that alternative modes of DNA replication and cell cycle provide mutational opportunities for fungal adaptation, and play roles in the evolution of endosymbioses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Occasional use of large carcasses by early hominins has been considered by some as opportunistic, possibly a fallback dietary strategy, and for others a more important survival strategy. At Olduvai Gorge, evidence for megafaunal butchery is scarce in the Oldowan of Bed I, but becomes more frequent and widespread after 1.8 Ma in Bed II, coinciding with the emergence of Acheulean technologies. Here, we present the earliest direct evidence of proboscidean butchery, including a newly documented elephant butchery site (EAK). This shift in behavior is accompanied by larger, more complex occupation sites, signaling a profound ecological and technological transformation. Rather than opportunistic scavenging, these findings suggest a strategic adaptation to megafaunal resources, with implications for early human subsistence and social organization. The ability to systematically exploit large prey represents a unique evolutionary trajectory, with no direct modern analogue, since modern foragers do so only episodically.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

In the presence of tobacco smoke these gain mutations that significantly increase their risk of transformation to lung squamous cell carcinoma. A small proportion of stem cells avoid the mutational damage caused by carcinogens in tobacco and are more abundant in the lungs of former smokers than ongoing smokers, indicating unexplained tissue-level genomic recovery. This mirrors epidemiological risk, which falls rapidly after quitting smoking. Somatic evolutionary mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed to explain these observations. Here, we present a computational framework to model each of these hypotheses within the upper airway epithelial stem cell population over the entire patient lifetimes of a cohort with diverse smoking histories. Applying a mechanistic learning approach based on a set of biologically informed metrics to single cell-derived whole-genome sequencing data, we identified subtle differences between epithelia modelled under different combinations of hypotheses. A slow-cycling subpopulation of stem cells, combined with suppression of immune predation of highly mutated stem cells while smoking, best matched observed data, a result converged upon by multiple distinct machine learning methodologies. Our findings, drawing on an evolutionary model of mutagen exposure at a whole-lifetime scale that is not feasible to model in vivo, reveal the mechanisms behind reduction in lung squamous cell carcinoma risk on cessation of smoking and inform future therapeutic interventions to prevent lung cancer initiation.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W025051/1;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EDDCPGM100002;CDEPIL-Jan24/100032;C11496/A30025;DRCPFA-Nov23/100003;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/P034616/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219478/Z/19/Z;211179/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UF130039;""},{""name"":""UCL Hospitals Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mz0pr34"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Rosetrees Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04e3zg361"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UCL Biomedical Research Centre"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03r9qc142"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Elucidating MHC-I-independent immune recognition mechanisms is therefore crucial for enhancing treatment responses and improving clinical outcomes in a greater number of patients. Leveraging single cell approaches, we discovered {gamma}{delta} T cell infiltration in biospecimens from patients with SCLC. Despite PD-1 expression, {gamma}{delta} T cells maintained a cytotoxic transcriptional profile, suggestive of an anti-tumor role. Indeed, high {gamma}{delta} T cell infiltration predicted improved response to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy in patients with SCLC. Moreover, using pre-clinical models, we demonstrated that {gamma}{delta} T cells are effective at tarlatamab (DLL3-CD3 BiTE) redirected SCLC killing and that zoledronate, an FDA-approved compound, can sensitize SCLC cells to {gamma}{delta} T cell-mediated killing.

However, the resulting signals are vulnerable to multiple sources of noise, such as those related to non-neuronal physiological fluctuations and head motion, which can alter FC estimates and influence their associations with behavioral outcomes. The best strategy for acquiring and processing rsfMRI data to mitigate noise remains an open question. In this study of 358 healthy individuals, we compared the denoising efficacy of 60 multi-echo (ME) and 30 single-echo (SE) rsfMRI preprocessing pipelines across six distinct measures of data quality. We also evaluated how each pipeline influences the effect sizes of FC-based predictive models of personality and cognitive measures estimated via cross-validated kernel ridge regression. We found that ME pipelines generally showed superior denoising efficacy to SE pipelines, but that no single pipeline was associated with both superior denoising efficacy and behavioural prediction. Using a heuristic scheme to rank pipelines across benchmark evaluations, we found that an ME acquisition combined with Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts Independent Component Analysis (ICA-AROMA) and Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offered a reasonable compromise between denoising efficacy and brain-behavior predictions for both ME and SE data.

Existing chelation therapeutics remove excess copper but lack intrinsic antioxidant capacity and frequently cause systemic toxicity. Here we evaluate melatonin, an FDA-approved indoleamine with antioxidant and putative metal-chelating activity, as a candidate therapeutic for WD. In ATP7B-/- hepatocytes, melatonin restored copper-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) to basal levels, reduced apoptosis twofold, and attenuated Nrf2 nuclear translocation leading to reduction of Hemoxygenase-1 abundance. Live-cell ratiometric analysis of GSSG/GSH using GRX1-roGFP2 expressed in melatonin-treated ATP7B-/- hepatocytes revealed a significant reduction in intensity-ratio, indicating an effective mitigation of copper-induced glutathione oxidation. Isothermal calorimetric titration revealed moderate Cu2+ affinity (K ITC=4.54 x 103 M-{superscript 1}), rationalized by MD-simulations showing an interaction energy of 18.5 x 10-3 kcal{middle dot}mol-{superscript 1} via amide-Cu{superscript 2} coordination. In-cellulo studies also revealed that copper-induced vesicularized ATP7B reinstates to Golgi in melatonin-treated hepatocytes. In vivo, melatonin treatment reduced copper-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos and lowered copper burden in Caenorhabditis elegans WD model. Our studies revealed that encapsulation of melatonin within an engineered polymeric nanocapsules having dithiol linkers, susceptible to cleavage by GSH, extended melatonins circulatory half-life ten-fold and enhanced its ROS-scavenging efficacy three-fold relative to free melatonin. This work introduces a unique dual-function therapeutic strategy that integrates antioxidant activity with copper chelation, simultaneously addressing copper overload and redox imbalance. Repurposing melatonin, with its established clinical safety, offers rapid and cost-effective translational pathway toward WD-therapy while providing a generalizable platform for redox- and metal-associated disorders.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Using this list of adaptive differences as a foundation for laboratory experiments, we find that the ecological strategy of the ecospecies is to hunt, kill and devour bacterial prey in viscous liquids. Instead of swarming on surfaces, Molassodon strains have differentiated and repurposed their lateral flagella to enhance swimming. We functionally link Type VI secretion and nutrient uptake to this motility phenotype and reconstruct the evolution of Molassodon, showing that several key genes have been imported from other Vibrio species.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

In particular, curation of morphological datasets are prone to human errors such as typographical errors, inconsistent formatting, and incomplete metadata, which hinder reproducibility and compliance with Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a transformative solution for enhancing research efficiency by automating data validation, improving accuracy, and streamlining curation workflows. This study explores the integration of an AI-based curation tool developed for MorphoBank, an open access repository established to enhance standardization and usability of morphological datasets. We present an AI-assisted curation tool designed to extract, structure, and standardize morphological character data from published literature into the NEXUS file format, a widely used format for phylogenetic analyses. This tool leverages machine learning techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the extraction of character names and states from text in various formats, reducing manual data entry errors and improving data completeness. By integrating this AI-driven approach into MorphoBank, we enhance dataset interoperability and improve metadata accuracy. The AI-assisted curation system significantly accelerates the processing of phylogenetic morphological character datasets while maintaining high accuracy in character extraction and classification. AI is reshaping scientific data management by offering scalable and automated solutions for curating complex phylogenetic datasets. Our findings highlight how AI can assist in ensuring dataset reproducibility, minimizing curation bottlenecks, and improving the accessibility of large-scale morphological datasets. By enhancing compliance with FAIR principles, AI-based curation tools provide researchers with standardized, high-quality data for evolutionary and taxonomic studies.

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

While some ART procedures, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, are known to alter the epigenetic landscape of early embryonic development, their impact on DNA sequence stability is unclear. Here, we leverage the strengths of the laboratory mouse model system to investigate whether a standard ART regimen--ovarian hyperstimulation, gamete isolation, IVF, embryo culture, and embryo transfer--affects genome stability. Age-matched cohorts of ART-derived and naturally conceived C57BL/6J inbred mice were reared in a controlled setting and whole genome sequenced to [~]50x coverage. Using a rigorous pipeline for de novo single nucleotide variant (dnSNV) discovery, we observe a [~]30% increase in the dnSNV rate in ART-compared to naturally-conceived mice. Analysis of the dnSNV mutation spectrum identified signature contributions related to germline DNA repair activity, affirming expectations and evidencing the quality of our dnSNV calls. We observed no enrichment of dnSNVs in specific genomic contexts, suggesting that the observed rate increase in ART-derived mice is a general genome-wide phenomenon. Similarly, we show that the developmental timing of dnSNVs is similar in ART- and natural-born cohorts. Together, our findings show that ART is moderately mutagenic in house mice and motivate future work to define the precise procedure(s) associated with this increased mutational vulnerability. While we caution that our findings cannot be immediately translated to humans, they nonetheless emphasize a pressing need for investigations on the potential mutagenicity of ART in our species.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis study investigates whether assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) increase the risk of inherited genetic mutations in offspring. Using a well-controlled mouse model system, we compared the de novo mutation burden in genomes of mice conceived through ART to a naturally conceived cohort. We find a [~]30% increase in new DNA mutations in ART-conceived mice, suggesting that ART procedures have a genome destabilizing effect. This increase in mutation rate appears to be uniform across the genome, rather than attributable to specific genomic contexts. While we caution against the direct translation of our findings to humans, our work nonetheless highlights the need for further research into the genetic safety of ART in people.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 GM133415;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

The physical principles guiding this centromere positioning remain unknown. Here, we reveal that human core centromeres are directed to the chromatin surface by repulsion of centromere-associated proteins - independent of condensin-mediated loop extrusion and microtubule engagement. Using cellular perturbations, biochemical reconstitution, and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that chromatin surface localisation emerges from repulsion between condensed chromatin and both the kinetochore and the highly negatively charged centromere protein, CENP-B. Together, these elements form a centromeric region composed of two domains with opposing affinities, one favouring integration within the mitotic chromosome and the other favouring exposure to the surrounding cytoplasm, thereby driving surface positioning. Tethering synthetic negatively charged proteins to chromatin was sufficient to recapitulate this surface localisation in cells and in vitro, indicating that electrostatic repulsion is a key determinant of surface localisation. These findings demonstrate that centromere layering is not hardwired by chromatin folding patterns but instead emerges from phase separation in chromatin. Our work uncovers electrostatic polarity as a general and programmable mechanism to spatially organise chromatin.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Here, we investigate how prior acclimation impacts algal fitness upon a change in daylight intensity and how quickly Chlamydomonas can reprogram its photoprotective strategy in a diurnal context. We performed a systems analysis of synchronized populations acclimated to diurnal LL when subjected to HL days and of populations acclimated to diurnal HL when subjected to LL days. In the latter case, diurnal photoacclimation decreased fitness during the first day at a new light intensity: HL-acclimated cells barely increased in size over the first LL period, and they failed to complete a cell cycle. However, although LL-acclimated cells showed severe photodamage after 6 hours of HL, they recovered chloroplast form and function later that afternoon and successfully divided at nightfall. These cells rapidly altered their thylakoid membrane ultrastructure, increased their photoprotective quenching capacity, and decreased their inventory of photosystem and antenna proteins by the end of the first HL day. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed rapid induction of thousands of genes, including those encoding proteases, chaperones, and other proteins involved in the chloroplast unfolded protein response. These results show that the alga is highly flexible and competent to rapidly acclimate to changes in diurnal light intensity.","[{""name"":""Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006wxqw41"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GBMF9203;""},{""name"":""US Department of Energy Office of Science"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Office of Biological and Environmental Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0114b2m14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-AC05-76RL01830;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1S10OD025063;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Due to the lack of an internal protein synthesis machinery, they entirely depend on the import of target proteins to carry out their functions within peroxisomes. While the process of cargo/receptor recognition is well understood, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the subsequent translocation steps, including cargo release and receptor recycling, is lacking behind. Here, we provide structural and functional evidence on the role of Pex8 in these processes. First, we show that Pex8 in yeast is essential for peroxisomal cargo translocation, irrespective of the mechanism of receptor/cargo recognition. Next, we reveal that Pex8 binds through an irregular twelvefold HEAT repeat array to a short three-helical bundle within the otherwise unfolded N-terminal domain of the Pex5 receptor. Impairing this interaction abolishes peroxisomal protein translocation. It is complemented by a secondary autonomous Pex8 cargo-like interaction site with the C-terminal domain of Pex5, thus generating a bipartite interaction between the two proteins.

Our data support a model in which Pex5/Pex8 complex formation allows assembly with the peroxisomal Pex2/Pex10/Pex12 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to initiate recycling of the receptor. In summary, our findings provide in-depth insight into the transition from cargo release into peroxisomes to receptor recycling, which is essential to uncover the overall process of the peroxisomal cargo translocation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

However, acquisition times often span minutes to hours as a single fluorophore is measured at a time. Applying it to study cellular processes in living cells therefore requires careful consideration of where and when to apply MINFLUX data acquisition, a consideration where manual control limits its potential applications. Here, to overcome the limitations of acquisition speed, acquisition initiation, and data throughput, we present a smart microscopy method that uses confocal imaging as a monitoring method, runs real-time image analysis, and only applies MINFLUX data acquisition exactly where and when deemed necessary based on the analysis outcome. The method, event-triggered MINFLUX, is controlled through a custom-written and open source Python widget that automatically controls a commercial MINFLUX microscope. We apply this method to investigate molecular membrane dynamics and organization during three different cellular events: two-dimensional lipid dynamics at caveolae; three-dimensional membrane topography during dynamin-mediated endocytosis; and three-dimensional membrane fluidity and topography during budding site formation of HIV-1 proteins. Thanks to rapid event detection and minimal regions of interest the method provides data that would be unfeasible or impossible to acquire through manual control of the microscope.","[{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-06139_VR;""},{""name"":""German Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INST 275_405_1;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390713860;316213987;44711651;460889961;""},{""name"":""Photonics Research Germany"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""13N15713;13N15717;""},{""name"":""Free State of Thuringia"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FGI 0031;FGR 0054;""},{""name"":""Leibniz Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01n6r0e97"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K548/2023;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

We aimed to map the production of scientific publications worldwide in terms of democracy and freedom of press ratings of countries. Democracy ratings used the Democracy Index in 2024 and in 2006 (when first released by the Economist Intelligence Unit) and Freedom of Press ratings used the 2024 index by Reports Without Borders. The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press. Proportions of publications originated from countries with problematic or worse situations were 81%, 91%, 61%, 62%, and 63% for political, economic, legislative, sociocultural, and safety/security dimensions, respectively. Results were similar when limited to articles published in 2024 in journals with continuous annual presence in Scopus during 2006-2024. In conclusion, most published science originates from countries struggling or suffering in democracy and/or freedom of press. The deeper causes and implications of this emerging landscape require further study.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091262

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1757110091263
