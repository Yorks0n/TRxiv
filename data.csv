However, the subcellular processes during cell death following resistosome activation remain unclear. Here, we visualized the changes in calcium signaling and organelle behavior after activation of the NRC4 (NLR-required for cell death 4) resistosome. We found that NRC4 membrane enrichment coincided with calcium influx. This is followed by sequential mitochondria and plastid disruption, endoplasmic reticulum fragmentation and cytoskeleton depolymerization. Subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity, nuclear shrinkage, and vacuolar collapse mark the terminal stage of cell death. Our findings reveal a spatiotemporally-resolved cascade of subcellular events downstream of resistosome activation, providing new mechanistic insight into the execution phase of plant immune cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

SINEs retain sequence features recognized by the POL III machinery and constitute a substantial portion of vertebrate genomes. Despite their impact on genome stability and evolution, the mechanisms governing SINE transcription remain poorly understood. Although DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation have been implicated in their repression, we find these pathways play only a minor role in mouse embryonic stem cells. Instead, we identify the ChAHP complex as a key repressor of SINE B2 elements. ChAHP directly inhibits POL III transcription by blocking TFIIIB recruitment without affecting TFIIIC binding. This selective interference prevents transcription initiation and highlights a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our findings establish ChAHP as a non-canonical repressor of POL III-dependent SINE transcription, offering new insights into the control of this pervasive class of non-coding genomic elements.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

While prior work has shown that tool use alters body representation, little is known about how artificial augmentations alter body representations as they are worn and used. Here, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, simply wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, following active use, both biological and artificial finger representations expanded significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a lasting aftereffect on biological finger representation was observed even after device removal. Our findings demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into the body representation, with dynamic adjustments in proprioceptive space shaped by both structural and functional properties of the device. This work advances our understanding of how the sensorimotor system accommodates artificial extensions and highlights the potential for body- augmenting technologies to be intuitively integrated into body representation. These results have direct implications for the design of prosthetics, exoskeletons, and other assistive technologies aimed at extending human physical capacity.

Significance statementHow do wearable augmentations reshape our sense of the body? Using a custom- built exoskeleton that extended the fingers, we tracked changes in body representation across four stages of wear and use. We found that the sensorimotor system rapidly integrates artificial extensions into its somatosensory map: first contracting, then expanding perceived finger length in response to structure and function, with the shifts persisting after device removal. Our findings reveal dynamic, use-dependent plasticity in body representation, which has direct relevance for designing prosthetics, exoskeletons, and assistive devices.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

We transformed our library into 72 diverse strains of E. coli. Each strain natively harbors a different suite of antiphage systems whose activation typically inhibits growth. By tracking plasmids that were selectively depleted, we identified over 100 candidate phage trigger-E. coli pairs.

While many aspects of Patescibacteria remain enigmatic, an intriguing feature is the widespread occurrence of introns within their compact genomes. To better understand the diversity, roles, and evolution of bacterial introns, we focused on tRNA introns and analyzed Patescibacteria complete genome. Notably, 20% of these genomes lacked at least one tRNA gene for a canonical amino acid, primarily tRNAAsn and tRNAAsp, whereas other tRNA genes were readily detected. This observation led us to conduct further analyses, resulting in the discovery of a novel group I intron insertion site at position 35/36 within the anticodon loop that likely prevented detection by conventional annotation tools. Splicing assays demonstrated that these bacterial introns are catalytically active and capable of self-splicing. To assess the broader distribution of this insertion site across bacteria, we analyzed 4,934 bacterial genomes and identified 269 group I introns within tRNA genes across 14 phyla. Nearly 70% of introns at position 35/36 originate from Patescibacteria, indicating that this feature is largely confined to the phylum. Subgroup classification showed that 79% of all tRNA introns belonged to the IC subgroup, whereas almost all Patescibacteria introns were assigned to IA, suggesting a distinct evolutionary origin. As most tRNA introns lacked homing endonuclease genes, horizontal transfer appears limited. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary history of bacterial group I introns in tRNAs, with particular emphasis on Patescibacteria. IMPORTANCE Group I introns in bacterial tRNA genes were previously known only in a limited number of phyla. Our study expands this knowledge by identifying a novel insertion position in tRNA genes of phylum Patescibacteria and mapping their phylogenetic distribution across bacterial lineages. Our result revealed that group I introns inserted in tRNA genes differed in subgroups between Patescibacteria and other bacteria, highlighting the evolutionary uniqueness of introns of Patescibacteria. Additionally, we found that group I introns are maintained in 43% of bacterial phyla, with tRNA insertions being the most common. Our findings highlight that even in complete genomes, the presence of group I introns can hinder the detection of all 20 canonical tRNA genes by conventional tRNA annotation tools. This study illustrates the overlooked phylogenetic distribution of group I introns across the bacterial domain.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

MethodsThis in vitro study used sixty dental enamel specimens, divided into 12 groups: traditional Red Bull(R) energy drink modified with three concentrations each of calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex (0.71, 1.43, and 2.15g), dicalcium malate (0.83, 1.66, and 2.50g), and calcium citrate malate (1.26, 2.53, and 3.80g); unmodified traditional Red Bull(R) energy drink; deionized water; and commercially available calcium-supplemented Life Mix Baixa Caloria(R) orange juice. The pH of all drinks was measured using a pHmeter. Specimens were exposed to the drinks for two minutes. Surface roughness and microhardness were assessed before and after exposure using a rugosimeter and a Vickers microhardness tester, respectively.

ResultsThe addition of calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex increased the energy drinks pH proportionally to the concentration added. Specimens exposed to modified drinks showed reduced roughness (p < 0.004) compared to control drinks. Drinks modified with 2.50g of dicalcium malate and 2.15g of the calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex significantly preserved enamel microhardness (p < 0.004) compared to the unmodified energy drink. Across all modifications, enamel surface microhardness loss was lower than in control groups, except for deionized water.

ConclusionThe addition of calcium formulations to the energy drink effectively reduced its erosive potential at all concentrations, with the calcium/phosphorus/potassium complex demonstrating the greatest protective effect.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

Despite an improved knowledge of the A. fumigatus genome, we still know little about the transcriptome, with key regulatory sequences like the untranslated regions of mRNA based only on in silico predictions and bulk-RNA-seq. Here, we provide an improved description of 5' and 3' untranslated regions of A. fumigatus poly(A)-enriched RNA through experimental mapping of transcription start sites and polyadenylation sites using 5' and 3' End-Seq. We assigned high-quality 5' ends to 2,747 genes (average length 126 nt), 3' ends to 7,079 genes (average length 268 nt), and improved our understanding of the regulatory landscape of A. fumigatus gene expression. We leveraged the refined 5' UTRs to identify upstream open reading frames and binding sites for important RNA binding proteins like the translational regulator Ssd1 and the 3' UTRs to define binding sites for PUF proteins known to contribute to mRNA localization and regulation. Although a single isoform typically dominated expression, we observed 148 instances of alternative start sites and 1,675 alternative stop sites. Interestingly, we detected multiple examples of premature transcriptional termination, including the first evidence for promoter-proximal premature transcriptional termination in a member of the Eurotiomycetes.

Here, we investigated the role of transcriptomic entropy in aging and cancer processes by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from thousands of human and mouse samples. We found that entropy changes during aging are highly tissue-specific, with some tissues showing increased entropy while others exhibit decreased or stable entropy levels. Transcriptomic entropy strongly correlates with age-related processes, showing positive associations with proliferation, cellular senescence, and somatic mutation burden, while negatively correlating with stemness. Surprisingly, cellular reprogramming also increases transcriptomic entropy. In cancer, we observed that primary tumors generally display higher entropy than normal tissue, with entropy levels further increasing in metastatic stages. Notably, treatment-resistant tumors showed distinct entropy patterns, with acquired resistance associated with increased entropy, while primary resistance and immediate post-treatment responses showed decreased entropy. Higher entropy levels predicted poor survival outcomes in multiple cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Furthermore, differential expression analysis revealed that entropy-associated genes are enriched in developmental processes and depleted in metabolic pathways, indicating a possible link to cellular dedifferentiation. Finally, we found increased entropy in various age-related diseases beyond cancer, suggesting that transcriptomic disorder may be a common feature in age-related pathologies. Our findings establish transcriptomic entropy as a fundamental parameter in aging and cancer progression, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and challenging the current view that increased disorder is always detrimental.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

However, it is unclear if ramping activity is related to the cognitive process of estimating time, or to other behavioral factors such as anticipating reward or regulating movements. Here, we harnessed two novel approaches to determine how these factors contribute to prefrontal and striatal ramping activity in mice performing an interval timing task. First, to determine how movement contributes to ramping activity, we tracked movement velocity using DeepLabCut as well as task-specific movements while recording prefrontal or striatal ensembles during interval timing. We found that time was more accurately decoded by ramping neurons than movement-modulated neurons, with the exception of prefrontal velocity-modulated neurons. Second, to disambiguate temporal signals from anticipatory reward signals we compared activity patterns in neurons that were recorded during interval timing to the same neurons recorded during a Pavlovian conditioning task. We found more ramping activity and more accurate temporal decoding by neuronal ensembles during interval timing compared to Pavlovian conditioning. Together, these data quantify contributions of time estimation, movement, and reward anticipation in prefrontal and striatal ensembles, and they suggest that ramping is a cognitive signal that estimates time. Our results provide insight into how prefrontal and striatal ensembles multiplex information to effect temporal control of action.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

To better understand bronchial tissue responses to viral infection, we have developed a preclinical in vitro model mimicking the multiciliated airway epithelium, from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and cultured in an air-liquid interface (iALI). By using iPSCs reprogrammed from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we successfully generated a fully differentiated and functional bronchial epithelium exhibiting key COPD features with goblet and basal cell hyperplasia and tissue inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 could infected and replicated for several weeks in both healthy and COPD models, with a recurrent peak at 3 days after infection. Infected iALI exhibited cilia destruction and increased mucus secretion. Innate immune response of different infected iALI reveals a differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Notably, COPD iALI displayed an earlier innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to healthy iALI, suggesting a genetic susceptibility of COPD iALI towards inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a less efficient response to antivirals. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the iALI bronchial organoid model is a powerful tool for investigating bronchial tissue responses to long term respiratory viral infections, antivirals, and patients with COPD or other airway pathology.

Short AbstractSARS-CoV-2 causes severe lower respiratory tract infection in COVID-19 patients, which can persist over time. Here, we used an in-house developed in vitro airway organoid derived from induced human pluripotent stem cells (iALI) to study SARS-CoV-2 infection over long term in healthy or COPD patients whom respiratory failure is at risk during infection. Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in high and lethal infection of bronchial epithelial cells, that persist over time, inducing mucus secretion, destruction of ciliated cells and specific cytokine release. A late innate immune response is observed in the healthy iALI, while in iCOPD, it appears earlier and stronger, suggesting a different sensing of SARS-CoV-2 in COPD patients, accompanied by a reduce sensitivity to antivirals. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the iALI organoid model is a powerful tool for investigating bronchial tissue responses to long term respiratory viral infections, from healthy to pathologic patients.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

However, their contents, functions, and evolutionary mechanisms remain unclear. We performed comparative genomics on long-read assembled GRCs from male House Finch (Haemorhous mexicanus), Common Rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus), and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), the first two of which are newly presented and annotated here. These long-read GRCs are repeat-rich (63-74%), despite their wide variation in size (16-160 megabases), individually distinct gene content, and variable evolutionary histories. These GRCs have accumulated intact long terminal repeat (LTR) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), and their proliferation co-occurs with speciation events of passerine birds. In contrast, normal chromosomes (autosomes and sex chromosomes) are known to purge ERVs through ectopic recombination of LTRs that generate solo LTRs. Furthermore, transcriptomic data reveal significantly higher ERV transcription on GRCs than on A-chrs in House Finch testis. We propose that GRCs act as reservoirs of active ERVs, promoting germline transposition and potentially accelerating adaptation and speciation. This study suggests that GRCs play an indispensable role and likely contribute to adaptive diversification in birds.

We subjected human endothelial cells (ECs) and muscle cells (MCs) to cyclic mechanical stretch and investigated acute transcriptomic and metabolomic changes. Mechanical loading induced several responses typically seen after exercise in vivo. Both cell types released acetate in response to stretching, but surprisingly, many of the other changes were in opposite directions. For instance, electron transport chain genes were downregulated in ECs and upregulated in muscle cells. Additionally, ECs shifted their transcriptomic profile to a growth-oriented direction and 13C-(U)-glucose tracing experiments revealed increased serine synthesis in ECs. Mechanistic experiments related to the serine synthesis pathway enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) revealed its importance in EC anabolism. Our data suggest that mechanical loading induces cell type-specific responses in ECs and MCs, and several of these effects recapitulate exercise effects in vivo. In ECs, mechanical loading activates the serine synthesis pathway, and the serine-synthesizing enzyme PHGDH was highlighted as essential in regulating EC growth, a process indispensable in angiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

They are used to treat metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer, but resistance is common, and this has been associated with TP53 loss and senescence evasion. We show here that enlarged CDK4/6i-treated cells that evade senescence mis-segregate chromosomes due to defective chromosomal alignment and a weakened mitotic checkpoint, leading to aneuploidy and DNA damage. The chromosome alignment errors are associated with impaired Sgo1 localisation to centromeres and defective sister chromatin cohesion during mitosis. Importantly, all these mitotic defects can be rescued by constraining cell size during the CDK4/6i-treatment, and specifically restoring cohesion rescues the chromosome segregation errors. Together, this demonstrates mechanistically how cell enlargement drives genetic and karyotypic change in cells that re-enter the cell cycle following CDK4/6 inhibition. This could help fuel the rapid emergence of chemotherapy-resistant clones, especially in p53-null cells that evade senescence to drive drug-resistance in patients.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

However, the full diversity of circulating strains and key reservoirs facilitating transmission within hospitals is unknown. We investigated the population structure and within-sample diversity of K. pneumoniae in a Malawian neonatal unit. We recruited 94 mother-neonate pairs and collected regular stool samples, hand swabs, cot swabs and swaddling cloth samples. Additionally, we collected ward surface-swab samples and staff hand swabs weekly. To establish within sample diversity we employed a dual sequencing approach; (i) single colony picks from Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase selective chromogenic agar for short-read whole genome sequencing; and (ii) post-enrichment metagenomics using plate sweeps from a non-selective agar. In total, we analysed 552 single-colony picks and 772 plate-sweeps from neonate, maternal and environmental samples. Comparing sequence types, surface antigens, antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, and plasmid replicons, between sample types and sequencing approaches, we identified key advantages and limitations of post-enrichment metagenomics. Our approach revealed high diversity at both the ward and individual level, with a high proportion of the overall diversity likely due to Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase negative organisms. ST15 and ST307 were found in high numbers using both methodologies, whilst ST14 was identified primarily from the non-selective post-enrichment metagenomic samples. Isolates and samples from ward surface swabs had more antimicrobial resistance genes and plasmid replicons than those isolated from human stool. This approach demonstrates the value of combining colony-based and metagenomic sequencing approaches, as a cost-effective alternative to shotgun metagenomics to study health care associated infections.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and postnatal brain resulted in rich DNA-RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The two modalities concordance and distinction in spatial patterns highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics of both epigenome and transcriptome underlying mammalian embryogenesis, revealing details in sequence, cell type, and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to DNA cytosine methylation for a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology over development and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) outbreaks are frequently caused by strains belonging to two phylogenetic lineages of the human-adapted strains of the Mtb Complex, namely lineages (L) 2 and L4. We hypothesized that members of L2 and L4 are more intrinsically drug tolerant, and as such, more readily evolve drug resistance. To explore this, we devised a high throughput in vitro assay to measure drug tolerance in Mtb. We selected a cohort of strains representative of the globally most frequent lineages L1-L4. We measured tolerance to rifampicin and bedaquiline and found L3 and L4 strains to have higher tolerance compared to L1 and L2 strains. In addition, phylogenetically closely related strains exhibited similar levels of tolerance, suggesting that tolerance is heritable. Finally, we explored genes previously reported to be associated with tolerance in Mtb and found significant enrichment in mutations in genes involved in cell wall and cell processes, intermediary metabolism and respiration, as well as lipid metabolism in high-tolerance strains.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

It is a risk factor for eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and the proposed ""orthorexia nervosa"") and psychological distress, but its biological mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesised that this mechanism operates through the stomach: increased gastric power differentiates appetising from unappetising foods, vagal stimulation reduces food liking, and gastric proto-nausea can be evoked by disgust; all contributors to disordered eating. We used electrogastrography alongside high-density facial landmark tracking to gauge responses to minimally processed (""healthy""), highly processed (""unhealthy""), and culturally unaccepted (""disgusting"") foods in a non-clinical sample (N=77). Trait orthorexia was associated with increased self-reported desire to eat healthy foods. Moreover, we found that higher orthorexia was associated with increasing disgust-related facial responses to unhealthy and disgusting foods. We then identified a relationship between food-healthiness ratings and gastric power: those who generally assigned lower healthiness ratings to foods showed higher gastric power for unhealthy than healthy foods, whereas those who expressed higher healthiness ratings showed higher gastric power for healthy over unhealthy foods. This suggests that the stomach tracks individual differences in eating preferences. Crucially, and contrary to our expectations, higher trait orthorexia was associated with a paradoxical increase in gastric power to unhealthy foods. One explanation is that higher gastric power for unhealthy foods reflects increased appetite for self-denied foods. Alternatively, orthorexia itself could be an adaptive response to exert stronger cognitive control over a pre-existing gastric appetite for unhealthy foods.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Here, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 20 years of neural data from the BrainGate and BrainGate2 pilot clinical trials. This dataset spans 2,319 recording sessions and 20 arrays from the first 14 participants in these trials. On average, arrays successfully recorded neural spiking waveforms on 35.6% of electrodes, with only a 7% decline over the study enrollment period (up to 7.6 years, with a mean of 2.8 years). We assessed movement intention decoding performance using a ""decoding signal-to-noise ratio"" (dSNR) metric, and found that 11 of 14 arrays provided meaningful movement decoding throughout study enrollment (dSNR > 1). Three arrays reached a peak dSNR greater than 4.5, approaching that achieved during able-bodied computer mouse control (6.29). We also found that dSNR increases logarithmically with the number of electrodes, providing a pathway for scaling performance. Longevity and reliability of Utah array recordings in this study were better than in prior nonhuman primate studies. However, achieving peak performance consistently will require addressing unknown sources of variability.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

Movement has opposite effects on population synchrony in the two layers, desynchronizing L2/3 by abolishing spontaneous population oscillations, and synchronizing L5, where excitatory cells are less entrained by oscillation and more strongly correlated with movement itself. Spontaneous activity is lower-dimensional in L2/3 than L5, with L2/3 population activity dominated by a single dimension of overlap between spontaneous and stimulus-evoked subspaces. We conclude that the population code of in different layers of the visual cortex differentially balances visual and non-visual signals.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Here, we present a large-scale single-cell analysis of transcriptomic sex differences in the human brain, using 169 samples from 15 females and 15 males across six cortical regions, selected based on in vivo neuroimaging measures of sex-biased volume. We find that sex effects on gene expression are highly patterned across cortical regions, cell types, and genes. They are most pronounced in: i) multiple cell types in the fusiform cortex (linked to male-biased volume and sex-biased behaviors); ii) oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and excitatory neurons across regions; and iii) a subset of sex chromosome and autosomal genes. Over 3,000 unique genes exhibit sex-biased expression, with 133 genes (119 autosomal) showing consistent sex differences across all region x cell type combinations. Sex chromosome genes show the largest sex differences in expression, driven by conserved X-Y gametologs, cell-type-specific biases in certain X- and Y-linked genes, and escape from X-inactivation - with the list of known escapees substantially expanded through our single-cell allele-specific expression analysis. Broader effects of sex on autosomal expression are captured in 13 core signatures with varying cell type vs. region specificity. These signatures are: i) shaped by regional differences in metabolism and laminar architecture; ii) enriched for diverse cellular compartments and biological processes; iii) regulated by sex steroids and X-linked transcription factors; and iv) linked to sex-specific genetic risk factors in sex-biased neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. This study substantially advances the breadth, depth, and granularity of knowledge on sex differences in the human brain, and provides a new open data resource to support future research.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

While prior studies using RNA interference suggested that Ptbp1 loss promotes neurogenesis, recent genetic studies have failed to replicate glia-to-neuron conversion following Ptbp1 loss of function. To evaluate the role of Ptbp1 in developmental neurogenesis in vivo, we conditionally disrupted Ptbp1 in retinal progenitors. Ptbp1 was robustly expressed in both retinal progenitors and Muller glia but absent from postmitotic neurons, and efficient loss of function in mutant animals was confirmed using immunostaining for Ptbp1. Furthermore, bulk RNA-Seq at E16 revealed accelerated expression of late-stage progenitor and photoreceptor-specific genes and altered splicing patterns in Ptbp1 mutants, including increased inclusion of rod photoreceptor-specific exons. However, we observed no defects in retinal lamination, progenitor proliferation, or cell fate specification in mature retina. ScRNA-Seq of mature mutant retinas revealed only modest transcriptional changes which partially recapitulate alterations seen following selective deletion of Ptbp1 in mature glia. Our findings demonstrate that Ptbp1 is dispensable for retinal development and suggest that its proposed role as a central repressor of neurogenesis should be reevaluated.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Linguistic laws such as Menzerath's law -predicting shorter elements in longer sequences -have emerged as widespread principles across vocal communication in many species. While these laws have been predominantly studied at the species level, the influence of individual and social factors remain underexplored. In this study, we investigated adherence to Menzerath's law in the vocal communication of carrion crows, Corvus corone corone, hooded crows, Corvus corone cornix and hybrids. Our findings show that crow call sequences adhere to Menzerath's law, with shorter calls occurring in longer sequences, demonstrating structural efficiency in vocal communication. In carrion crows specifically, we analysed call sequences in relation to individual characteristics (sex, age) and social variables (group size, dominance status, strength of affiliative relationships). Interestingly, adherence to Menzerath's law was stronger in males and younger individuals, while no effects were found for group size, dominance, or affiliative relationships. This study provides the first evidence of Menzerath's law in corvid vocal communication and suggests that individual-level traits, rather than broader social dynamics, may shape vocal efficiency. These findings broaden our understanding of widespread principles in animal communication and raise new questions about the ontogeny and flexibility of vocal efficiency in complex social species.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

The NOD-like receptor NLRP3 senses a variety of danger signals and environmental insults, resulting in pro-inflammatory response, inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. Its aberrant activation has been linked to many acute and chronic diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimers disease and cancer, making NLRP3 an attractive therapeutic target. Here we report the discovery, characterization, and structure of an indazole-based NLRP3 antagonist, BAL-1516, which potently inhibits inflammasome formation in monocytes and microglia. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of BAL-1516 bound to NLRP3 reveals a previously undescribed compound binding site at a surface groove of the nucleotide-binding domain with contacts to the FISNA and WHD subdomains. The characteristic feature of BAL compound binding is the formation of three hydrogen bonds to the peripheral beta-strand of the triple-ATPase; two from the indazoles nitrogen atoms and a third from the compounds linker region. Additional phenyl and thiazole moieties render the compound hydrophobic, allowing excellent blood-brain barrier penetration. The compound binding site is highly specific for NOD-like receptors, and the optimized compound BAL-1516 is able to directly bind mouse NLRP3 despite two conservative residue changes in the binding interface. The BAL compounds represent a first-in-class family of NLRP3 inhibitors, providing a broad design space, including covalent and degradative properties, for the development of NLRP3-directed therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

However, divergence may occur earlier than expected. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of bovine embryos from the 2- to 8-cell stages to examine transcriptional asymmetry. While gene expression was uniform at the 2-cell stage, variability increased at the 4-cell stage and became pronounced by the 8-cell stage. At this stage, blastomeres showed heterogeneity in MAPK pathway genes (e.g., RAC1, MAPK14) and the trophectoderm marker CDX2. These differences were associated with blastomere size; larger blastomeres more frequently initiated cavity formation, a functional marker of trophectoderm fate. Our findings suggest that both molecular and physical asymmetries contribute to early lineage bias, and that developmental plasticity may be lost in an asynchronous, cell-specific manner before visible morphological events such as compaction.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings.

ObjectiveTo develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser.

MethodsWe fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions.

ResultsThe fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%).

ConclusionsFine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment. This approach addresses key barriers to AI adoption in healthcare: privacy preservation, cost reduction, and accessibility for resource-constrained environments.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025.

Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

Local condensates or transcription factor hubs are a proposed mechanism for facilitating gene activation by nuclear complexes. To investigate their importance in endogenous Notch signalling, we deployed multi-colour live-imaging to measure Notch transcription-complex enrichment at a target gene locus in combination with the transcription dynamics. The co-activator Mastermind (Mam) was present in signalling-dependent nuclear foci, during Notch active developmental stages. Tracking these highly-dynamic Mam hubs together with transcription in the same nucleus, revealed that their condensation precedes and correlates with the profile of transcription and becomes stabilized if transcription is inhibited. Manipulations to signalling levels had concordant effects on hub intensities and transcription profiles, altering their probability and amplitude. Together the results argue that signalling induces the formation of transcription hubs whose properties are instrumental in the quantitative gene expression response to Notch activation.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Despite the abundance of tissue resident activated T cells, their contributions to these various roles remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a dominant population of IL-10 producing, T-bet expressing CD4+ Tr1 T cells, residing in the small intestinal lamina propria at homeostasis. Remarkably, these intestinal Tr1 cells emerge at the time of weaning and accumulate independently of the microbiota displaying similar abundance, function and TCR repertoire under germ-free conditions. Instead, the small intestinal T-bet+ Tr1 program is driven and shaped by dietary antigens, and accumulates in a cDC1-IL-27 dependent manner. Upon activation, these cells robustly express IL-10 and multiple inhibitory receptors, establishing a distinct suppressive profile. Altogether, this work uncovers a previously unappreciated dominant player in homeostatic small intestinal immunity with the potential to play critical suppressive roles in this tissue, raising important implications for the understanding of immune regulation in the intestine.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

As medical implants move towards smart technology and IoT, it is more important than ever to understand the electrical properties of biofilm formation. Here we present an attempt at understanding how C. albicans biofilm formation effects sensor technology. We propose that as the biofilm matures, it becomes increasingly hydrophobic and undergoes a reduction in effective dielectric constant and ionic conductivity. This results in an impedance mismatch that disrupts capacitive coupling between the sensor and surrounding media, this effect that can be reliably detected. We show that a C. albicans biofilm changes its dielectric properties during maturation and, once mature, can be equated to a thin dielectric insulator. We demonstrate that these properties can be used to enable constant monitoring of a C. albicans biofilm using passive RFID, offering a new detection methodology that may be applied to surfaces known to be readily colonise.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

A significant portion of this clearance occurs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via receptor-mediated transport. However, current models fail to capture the complex kinetics and spatial heterogeneity of receptors at the BBB. In this study, we derive a novel boundary condition that accounts for finite receptor kinetics, receptor density, and bidirectional transport across the BBB. Specifically, we develop a nonlinear homogenized boundary condition that ensures mass conservation and incorporates receptor-mediated Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We then implement this boundary condition in a cylindrical geometry representing a capillary surrounded by brain tissue. After verifying that the model matches an analytical steady state solution that we derive and that it yields realistic blood A{beta} concentrations, we explore how realistic variations in parameter values drive changes in both steady state A{beta} concentration and transient dynamics. Simulations and analytical results reveal that A{beta} concentrations in the brain are sensitive to receptor number ratios, while concentrations in the blood are primarily affected by the blood clearance rate. Additionally, we use the model to investigate A{beta} clearance during sequential sleep cycles and due to a pathological phenomenon, spreading depolarization. This work presents the first biophysically consistent boundary condition for A{beta} transport across the BBB, offering a powerful tool for studying brain waste clearance under both physiological and pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

However, it is still unclear whether reaching performance toward auditory and proprioceptive targets is modality-specific and whether performance improves under multisensory compared to unisensory conditions. Here, we addressed these questions by measuring reaching performance toward auditory, proprioceptive, and combined audio-proprioceptive targets. Accuracy was generally similar across conditions, but precision was lower for auditory targets compared to proprioceptive and audio-proprioceptive targets. A second experiment investigated whether providing additional proprioceptive information while reaching for an auditory target could improve precision in subsequent auditory-only trials. A slight improvement was observed, indicating that proprioceptive cues may help reduce spatial variability in auditory-guided actions, though not to the level seen in the multisensory condition. Overall, the results suggest that while the target modality slightly impacts movement accuracy, it has a significant impact on movement precision, with proprioceptive input playing a crucial role in enhancing precision. The concurrent availability of auditory and proprioceptive target information does not enhance precision beyond that achieved with proprioceptive information alone, whereas proprioception can modestly improve subsequent auditory-guided reaching.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) demonstrates remarkable tropism for motor neurons (MNs) and represents an exciting candidate to target genetic causes of motor neuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, systemic delivery risks immunogenicity and off-target effects, therefore localised delivery to the CNS is advantageous. New method: We assessed MN transduction in wild-type mice using AAV9-controlled, cytomegalovirus-promoter driven, enhanced GFP expression. Intra-cisterna magna (ICM) and intra-cerebroventricular (ICV) methods were compared. Four weeks post-delivery, GFP positivity in MN and astrocytes were quantified via immunohistochemical approaches and viral genome copy number determined by qPCR. Results: All delivery methods achieved high MN transduction in lumbar spinal cord (>68%). Unilateral ICV delivery provided the highest and most consistent levels (89 {+/-} 3%), and minimal peripheral viral copies. ICV delivery resulted in higher astrocytic transduction, most notably in the cortex. Brainstem MN transduction was high with all methods (>55%). We failed to find evidence of neuronal transduction in motor cortex. Viral genome copies trended higher in spinal cord and brainstem with ICV approaches, however further work is required to understand how bilateral delivery leads to such profound increases. Comparison to existing methods: Whilst several routes of administration into cerebrospinal fluid exist, direct comparisons for targeting MNs in vivo remain limited. Conclusions: Overall, consideration of gene therapy delivery methods is critical to ensure that the most appropriate administration route is chosen to reach MNs effectively, selectively, and at high levels to exact biological effects.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

However, experimental evidence that quantifies the impact of HWs on insects in their ecological context is limited. Here, we measured across multiple biological scales (e.g. fitness, physiology, transcriptomic and microbiota) the stage-specific responses of the arboviral vector Aedes albopictus when experiencing an ecologically relevant HW. In arboviral vectors, only females require a blood-meal thus contributing to the transmission cycle, but males, eggs and larvae can also be the target of control strategies to reduce population size. As such the understanding of the responses to a HW during mosquito development has both biological and epidemiological relevance. We observed stage-specific responses, starting at the egg stage. We saw egg hatching decreasing and delaying after HW exposure. On the contrary, larvae showed to be resilient to HW. Larvae repurposed their energy resulting in trivial mortality, but delayed development. At the adult stage, we observed a marked sex difference, with extensive (>50%) male mortality, accompanied by a small (16) number of genes elicited following HW exposure, which indicates that males have limited coping mechanisms against hot events. In females, we observed a reduced reproductive output, but only when HW occurred after a blood-meal. Finally, we saw extensive HW-dependent changes in the microbial composition of larvae, but female microbiota remained dominated by Wolbachia regardless of the thermal challenge. Our results have relevant implications for both the understanding of mosquito biology and the implementation of vector control strategies as the climate crisis progresses.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endoreplicate throughout the flys life, increasing their ploidy and cell volume, while at the same time nearby cells are lost into the gut lumen in an age-dependent process. These cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when endocycling in these cells is experimentally increased or decreased, nuclear and cellular volume as well as peritrophic membrane synthesis is concomitantly enhanced or reduced. Further, we show that blocking endocycling in these cells leads to functional defects in the peritrophic membrane, ultimately leading to increased susceptibility to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function over the course of the adult lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

DesignNationally-representative household survey, January-March 2025.

SettingGreat Britain.

Participants5,893 adults ([&ge;]18y).

Main outcome measuresParticipants were asked whether they had used medication in the past year to manage type 2 diabetes (excluding insulin), reduce the risk of heart disease, or support weight loss and, if so, whether they had used five specific GLP1-RAs. Those who had not used medication to support weight loss in the past year were asked how likely they would be to consider doing so in the next year. Estimates were reported stratified by participant characteristics and extrapolated to the national population.

ResultsOverall, 2.9% [2.4-3.4%] - [~]1.6 million adults - reported using a GLP-1RA to support weight loss in the past year, with 1.7% [1.4-2.1%] ([~]910,000 adults) using them exclusively for this purpose. The majority of those who used them exclusively for weight loss (91.4% [85.6-97.2%]) reported using GLP-1RAs that are licensed for this purpose in Great Britain, most commonly Mounjaro (tirzepatide; 80.2% [71.9-88.6%]). Of those who had not used weight-loss medication in the past year, 6.5% [5.7-7.3%] ([~]3.3 million adults) expressed an interest in doing so in the next year. Use and interest were more prevalent among women, people in mid-life, and those reporting past-month psychological distress. Interest was also higher among people facing greater socioeconomic disadvantage, including those in financial difficulty or unemployed due to long-term illness or disability.

ConclusionsIn the first quarter of 2025, 4.2 million adults in Great Britain - nearly one in ten - either had recently used a GLP-1RA to support weight loss or were interested in doing so in the near future. A substantial minority reported using a type of GLP-1RA that was not licensed for weight management, suggesting off-label use. Interest was particularly high among less advantaged socioeconomic groups, while use was similar across groups, highlighting the importance of addressing equity in access. These findings underscore the need to monitor who is accessing these medications and to ensure their safe, appropriate, and equitable provision.

Golgi defects and RUSH (Retention under Selective Hook) substantiated the role of AP-3 in trans-Golgi DCV budding. Proteomics revealed the loss of specific known and putative novel DCV proteins, which were mislocalized and rerouted to lysosomes in AP-3-depleted cells.

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

Concomitant release of miRNAs results in their rapid turnover. ZSWIM8-deficient mice exhibit reduced body size, cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental defects, and perinatal lethality. Despite widespread dysregulation of miRNAs in these animals, the vast majority of presumptive trigger RNAs that induce decay of ZSWIM8-regulated miRNAs remain undefined. Here, using AGO crosslinking and sequencing of hybrids (AGO-CLASH), a high-throughput method for identifying miRNA binding sites, we report the identification of Plagl1 as a TDMD trigger for miR-322-5p, and Lrrc58 and Malat1 as TDMD triggers for miR-503-5p in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In mice, deletion of the miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p trigger sites in the Plagl1 and Lrrc58 3' UTRs, respectively, abrogated TDMD of these miRNAs and resulted in miR-322/503-dependent embryonic growth restriction, recapitulating a key feature of the Zswim8--/-- phenotype. Thus, Plagl1 and Lrrc58 act as triggers for degradation of miR-322-5p and miR-503-5p, revealing a noncoding function for these mRNAs as regulators of mammalian body size.","NA","biorxiv",1751753316850

We analysed genotype array and exome sequence data from two birth cohorts (Millenium Cohort Study and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; n=5,320-8,622) to assess common and rare variant contributions to internalising and externalising symptoms across development. For both symptom domains, we identified associations with several polygenic indices (PGIs) that generally remained stable across development. For externalising symptoms, many of these associations reflected direct genetic effects. Concordant results were observed in the Born in Bradford cohort. A higher exome-wide burden of deleterious rare variants was associated with increased externalising (p-adj<0.03) and internalising symptoms (p-adj<0.01); trio models indicated direct genetic effects on externalising in MCS (p<0.05; p-adj>0.05) and on internalising symptoms in ALSPAC (p-adj<0.02). Common and rare genetic variants contributed independently, jointly explaining 2% of the variance in internalising and 5-7% in externalising symptoms. Finally, we show that the direct genetic effects of several PGIs and of deleterious rare variants on adolescent mental health are mediated by childhood externalising behaviours and/or cognitive ability. This study provides new insights into the genetic architecture of early-life mental health and identifies promising avenues for future research.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population-based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of over $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted) and $9.3 billion (undiscounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1751753316850
