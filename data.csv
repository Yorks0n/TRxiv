Coinfection is restricted by a mechanism known as superinfection exclusion (SIE), which prohibits the infection of a previously infected cell by a related virus after a period of time. SIE regulates coinfection for many different viruses, but its relevance to the infection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was unknown. In this study, we investigated this using a pair of SARS-CoV-2 variant viruses encoding distinct fluorescent reporter proteins. We show for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 coinfection of individual cells is limited temporally by SIE. We defined the kinetics of the onset of SIE for SARS-CoV-2 in this system, showing that the potential for coinfection starts to diminish within the first hour of primary infection, and then falls exponentially as the time between the two infection events is increased. We then asked how these kinetics would affect the potential for coinfection with viruses during a spreading infection. We used plaque assays to model the localised spread of SARS-CoV-2 observed in infected tissue, and showed that the kinetics of SIE restrict coinfection, and therefore sites of possible genetic exchange, to a small interface of infected cells between spreading viral infections. This indicates that SIE, by reducing the likelihood of coinfection of cells, likely reduces the opportunities for genetic exchange between different strains of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is an underappreciated factor in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) disproportionately affect females, suggesting modulation by sex hormones. We sought to investigate whether symptom severity is influenced by changes in sex hormones over the menstrual cycle, or by hormonal contraception. Methods. We carried out a retrospective analysis of menstrual and symptom data, prospectively collected via the Visible app from individuals with long COVID, ME/CFS, or both, who had regular menstrual cycles, between 7 September 2022 and 6 March 2024. Mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between symptom severity, menstrual cycle phase and contraception type. Findings. 948 users were included; 100% of users were female and 92.6% identified as women. The most tracked symptoms were fatigue (99.5% of users), brain fog (88.3%), headaches (85.1%) and muscle aches (78.6%). All menstrual cycle phases showed a modest, but significant, improvement compare to the menstrual phase, most markedly in the early luteal (IRR 0.963%, 95% CI: 0.958 - 0.968), but also the follicular (IRR = 0.985, 95% CI: 0.981 - 0.990) and late luteal phase (IRR = 0.980, 95% CI: 0.974-0.985). Crashes (sudden and severe worsening of symptoms following exertion) were significantly more frequent during menstruation than in other phases. Users of combined hormonal contraception (n=70) had a statistically significant reduction in overall symptom score (OR = 0.827, 95% CI: 0.690 - 0.992) and crash incidence (OR = 0.548, 95% CI: 0.350 - 0.856) compared to those not using hormonal contraception (=786). Interpretation. Menstruation is associated with worsened symptoms in long COVID and ME/CFS. Users of combined hormonal contraception report a lower symptom burden than non-users, suggesting a modulatory role of ovarian hormones. These findings could empower menstruating people living with long COVID and ME/CFS to anticipate cyclical changes in symptoms and plan their activities accordingly, and could also inform their use of contraception.","NA","medrxiv",1738102079229

It has often been considered as a source of novel genes but quantitative assessments of this claim are lacking. To investigate the potential role of natural transformation in gene acquisition, we analysed a large collection of genomes of Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) and Legionella pneumophila (Lp) for which transformation rates were experimentally determined. Natural transformation rates are weakly correlated with genome size. But they are negatively associated with gene flow in both species. This might result from a negative balance between transformation's ability to cure the chromosome from mobile genetic elements (MGEs), resulting in gene loss, and its facilitation of gene acquisition. By focusing on the latter, we found that transformation was significantly associated with small gene acquisition events while MGEs-driven gene acquisition tend to be associated with larger ones. Events of gene gain by transformation were spread more evenly in the chromosome than MGEs encoding the ability to integrate autonomously. We estimated the contribution of natural transformation to gene gains by comparing recombination-driven gene acquisition rates between transformable and non-transformable strains. Natural transformation may have caused the acquisition of up to 6.4% (Ab) and 1.1% (Lp) of the novel genes. This low contribution of natural transformation to the acquisition of novel genes implies that most novel genes must have been acquired by other means. Interestingly, the ones potentially acquired by transformation include almost 15% of the recently acquired antibiotic resistance genes in A. baumannii. Hence, natural transformation may drive the acquisition of relatively few novel genes but these may have high fitness impact.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

With the elaboration of large banks of data describing the presence and absence of narrative motifs around the world, scholars have been able to statistically investigate their potential routes and mechanisms of diffusion. However, despite genetic data allowing for increasingly refined demographic movement inferences, few have integrated it into their models, and none at a global scale. In this work, we capitalise on the augmenting availability of modern and ancient genetic data and on Yuri E. Berezkins database of more than 2000 mythological motifs worldwide to investigate the mechanisms involved in generating their present-day distribution at a global scale. The direct combination of both kinds of evidence allows us to explore in more depth the respective influences of population movement and replacement versus cultural diffusion on motif transmission. Our results show that both processes have played important roles in shaping their present-day distribution. By leveraging available ancient DNA (aDNA) and deepening the temporal scale of the detected signals, we reveal that correlations between mythemes and genetic patterns can be traced back to population movements that pre-date the Last Glacial Maximum and go back to at least 38,000 years ago, and possibly even earlier to the human expansion out of Africa some 60,000 years ago. Our work shows the earliest evidence for the transmission of stories and storytelling in human history, and supports the joint use of cultural evolutionary theory and population genetics to illuminate the biocultural processes that shaped our species.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

However, functional characterization of smRNAs remains limited by the scale and simplicity of phenotypic readouts. Recently, single-cell perturbation screening methods, which link CRISPR-mediated genetic perturbations to rich transcriptomic profiling, have emerged as foundational and scalable approaches for understanding gene functions, mapping regulatory networks, and revealing genetic interactions. However, a comparable approach for probing the regulatory consequences of smRNA perturbations is lacking. Here, we present Decoy-seq as an extension of this approach for high-content, single-cell perturbation screening of smRNAs. This method leverages U6-driven tough decoys (TuD), which form stable duplexes with their target smRNAs, for inhibition in the cell. Lentiviral-encoded TuDs are compatible with conventional single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies, allowing joint identification of the smRNA perturbation in each cell and its associated transcriptomic profile. We applied Decoy-seq to 336 microRNAs (miRNAs) and 196 tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) in a human breast cancer cell line, demonstrating its ability to uncover complex regulatory pathways and novel functions of these smRNAs. Notably, we show that tRFs influence mRNA polyadenylation and regulate key cancer-associated processes, such as cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, Decoy-seq provides a powerful framework for exploring the functional roles of smRNAs in normal physiology and disease, and holds promise for accelerating future discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

In the insect mushroom body (MB), odours are encoded by the activity of Kenyon cells (KCs). The random wiring of olfactory projection neurons (PNs) and KCs in the MB calyx is thought to enhance odour discrimination. Here, we examined the impact of deviations from random wiring and demonstrated their significant roles in shaping odour representations. We confirm that different KC types have distinct PN input biases correlated with the contextual relevance of the odour information delivered by the PNs. By recording the functional responses of different KC types to ethologically defined odour categories, we found that the {beta} and '{beta}' KCs produce segregated representations of relevant odour groups, potentially enhancing the categorisation of odours based on ethological relevance. Simultaneously, these same KC types displayed distinct representations for food-related odours, supporting precise discrimination. In contrast, {gamma} KCs lacked significant segregation of odour representations by ethological category. Computational simulations refined with our functional data indicated that the specific PN input connection pattern of individual KC types largely accounts for the observed representations. Taken together, we propose that individual KC types process odour information with distinct objectives, supporting both ethological categorisation and discrimination.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Using single-molecule assays that monitor DNA loop extrusion (LE) in the presence of NTR fragments, we identify two amino acid motifs, YDF and KTYQR, that hinder LE. KTYQR is found to fully impede LE activity, while YDF hinders cohesin to complete LE step cycles and converts cohesin into a unidirectional extruder by strengthening the affinity of STAG1 to DNA. We thus identify two distinct NTR motifs that stall LE via different yet synergistic mechanisms, highlighting the multifaceted ways employed by CTCF to modulate LE to shape and regulate genomes.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing.

We show that a single assumption of timescale invariance, formulated as an hierarchical generative model, is sufficient to explain a puzzling set of learning phenomena, including the power-law dependence of acquisition on inter-trial intervals and timescale invariance in response profiles.

To better understand the diversity of S. haemolyticus among preterm infants, we generated genome sequences of S. haemolyticus strains (n=140), which were isolated from 44 stool samples of 22 preterm infants from four different hospitals in the United Kingdom. Core genome phylogenetic analyses, incorporating 126 publicly available S. haemolyticus genome sequences, showed that 85/140 (60.1%) of the isolates, from three different hospitals, formed a clonal group with 79/85 (92.9%) strains being assigned to Multi-Locus Sequence Type (ST) 49. Antibiotic resistance genes were highly prevalent in the genome sequences. Using logistic regression, we found a strong association between the presence of the gene mecA and phenotypic resistance to oxacillin (odds ratio [OR]: 158.00, p<0.0001), and the aacA-aphD gene and phenotypic resistance to gentamicin aacA-aphD (OR: 162.00, p<0.001).

Using hybrid genome assemblies, we found it to be present on the chromosome (54.5% of strains) or on diverse plasmids (27.3%). Four strains (18.2%) had Tn4001 copies on both plasmid and chromosome. Our data suggest the existence of a distinct sub-population of S. haemolyticus that has adapted to colonise the gut of preterm infants. Prevalent resistance to antibiotics is of clinical concern and the diversity of genetic contexts of mecA and Tn4001 suggests widespread horizontal gene transfer and recombination in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Atherosclerosis is driven by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the formation of foam cells, accompanied by oxidative stress and the deposition of oxidized LDL (OxLDL), a pro-inflammatory molecule. Lowering LDL is the mainstay of current medical treatment in addition to blood pressure control and lifestyle changes, but to date, specifically targeting the inflammatory pathways contributing to plaque development without significant systemic side effects has not been feasible. Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have treated cancer and restored immune imbalance in autoimmune diseases in patients and resolved cardiac fibrosis in preclinical models. Using an inducible T regulatory cell (Treg) platform, we created an anti-OxLDL-specific CAR Treg therapy that exerts cell- and cytokine-mediated immunosuppression to reduce macrophage-foam cell formation in vitro. Murine anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs inhibited 80% of atherosclerotic plaque formation in immunocompetent mouse models of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. These studies illustrate the potential of anti-OxLDL CAR Tregs to mitigate the inflammation and plaque deposition associated with OxLDL, potentially offering a new therapeutic option for atherosclerosis.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Fungal endophytes that live inside plant leaves and roots could potentially mitigate plant heat stress from global warming. Conversely, disruptions of these symbioses could exacerbate the negative impacts of warming. To better understand the consistency and strength of warming-induced changes to fungal endophytes, we examined fungal leaf and root endophytes in three grassland warming experiments in the US ranging from 2 to 25 years and spanning 2000 km, 12 {degrees}C of mean annual temperature, and 600 mm of precipitation. We found that experimental warming disrupted symbiosis between plants and fungal endophytes. Colonization of plant tissues by septate fungi decreased in response to warming by 90% in plant leaves and 35% in roots. Warming also reduced fungal diversity and changed community composition in plant leaves but not roots. The strength, but not direction, of warming effects on fungal endophytes varied by up to 75% among warming experiments. Finally, warming decoupled fungal endophytes from host metabolism. Overall, warming-driven disruption of fungal endophyte community structure and function suggests that this symbiosis may not be a reliable mechanism to promote plant resilience and ameliorate stress responses under global change.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Cilia structures rely on intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves dynein-2 for retrograde and kinesin-2 for anterograde movements along doublet microtubules. Unlike dynein-1, which works on singlet microtubules within the cytoplasm, dynein-2 specifically works on the doublet microtubules inside the cilia. Previous cryo-electron tomography studies have shown that retrograde IFT, driven by dynein-2, occurs on the A-tubule of the doublet, suggesting a specialized regulatory mechanism involving dynein-2. However, the molecular basis of this specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigated this mechanism using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with Volta Phase Plate (VPP), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical analysis. Our biochemical assay revealed that the microtubule-binding domain of dynein-2 exhibits a higher affinity for the ciliary doublet microtubule compared to dynein-1. Cryo-ET with VPP further visualized the preferential binding of dynein-2 to the A-tubule of the doublet microtubule. MD simulations suggest that the preferential binding of dynein-2 is attributed to the tyrosinated tubulin in the A-tubule. These findings uncover a tyrosination-dependent regulatory mechanism that governs the bidirectional transport of IFT on doublet microtubules, providing new insights into the spatial and functional specialization of ciliary transport systems.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits also occur during aging, and notably in the absence of disease. The cerebellum, which modulates movement and cognition, is susceptible to cell loss in both aging and disease. Here, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in aged mice is not spatially random but rather occurs in a pattern of parasagittal stripes. We also find that aged mice exhibit impaired motor coordination and more severe tremor compared to younger mice. However, the relationship between patterned Purkinje cell loss and motor dysfunction is not straightforward. Examination of postmortem samples of human cerebella from neurologically typical individuals supports the presence of selective loss of Purkinje cells during aging. These data reveal a spatiotemporal cellular substrate for aging in the cerebellum that may inform about how neuronal vulnerability leads to neurodegeneration and the ensuing deterioration of behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

In zebrafish, by contrast, fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix deposition and inflammation are tightly regulated to facilitate regeneration. However, the regulatory cross-talk between fibroblasts and the innate immune system in the regenerating CNS remains poorly understood. Here, we show that zebrafish fibroblasts possess a dual role in inducing and resolving inflammation, which are both essential for regeneration. We identify a transient, injury-specific cthrc1a+ fibroblast state with an inflammation-associated, less differentiated, and non-fibrotic profile. Induction of this fibroblast state precedes and contributes to the initiation of the inflammatory response. At the peak of neutrophil influx, cthrc1a+ fibroblasts coordinate the resolution of inflammation. Disruption of these inflammation dynamics alters the mechano-structural properties of the lesion environment and inhibits axon regeneration. This establishes the biphasic inflammation control by dedifferentiated fibroblasts as a pivotal mechanism for CNS regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

However, limited knowledge exists about the environmental, physiological, and genetic factors influencing mosquito activity patterns. This knowledge gap is partly due to a lack of tools to accurately quantify the behavior of free-flying mosquitoes over extended periods. Here, we introduce BuzzWatch, an open-source, low-cost platform designed to continuously monitor mosquito flight behavior over several weeks with high temporal resolution. BuzzWatch records videos of mosquitoes freely flying in a transparent cage and automates the extraction, analysis, and visualization of behavioral data, including flight trajectories and population-level flight and sugar-feeding statistics. Using BuzzWatch, we quantified the daily rhythms of 10 Aedes aegypti populations from various geographic origins. Globally invasive Ae. aegypti showed increased sugar feeding and flight activity during midday compared to native African populations. Our platform further revealed subtle, long-lasting effects of blood feeding on activity patterns and a complex response to extended daylight periods. By integrating a host-seeking module in BuzzWatch to deliver CO2 and heat pulses, we observed a twofold increase in Ae. aegypti's response to host-associated cues during the daytime compared to nighttime. Combined, these results demonstrate BuzzWatch's potential to investigate responses to host cues over seconds, natural variability in daily rhythms over hours, and phenotypic plasticity over days. BuzzWatch offers a novel perspective on mosquito behavior over multiple timescales, paving the way for advanced ecological and epidemiological studies that can inform targeted and effective vector control strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

These tasks demand considerable manual effort from bioinformaticians, creating inefficiencies and limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-powered agents offer promising solutions to streamline and automate these workflows. However, existing automated systems, while effective for short, well-defined tasks, often struggle with long, multi-step workflows due to challenges such as error propagation, limited adaptability to emerging tools, and the inability of LLMs to generalize to niche bioinformatics tasks. Achieving effective workflow automation requires robust task coordination, dynamic knowledge retrieval, and mechanisms to ensure errors are identified and resolved before they impact downstream processes. Results: We present BioMaster, a multi-agent framework designed to automate and streamline complex bioinformatics workflows. BioMaster incorporates specialized agents with role-based responsibilities, enabling precise task decomposition, execution, and validation. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to dynamically retrieve domain-specific knowledge, improving adaptability to new tools and niche analyses. BioMaster also introduces enhanced control over input and output validation to ensure pipeline consistency and employs a memory management strategy optimized for handling long workflows. Experiments across diverse bioinformatics tasks, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, and Hi-C processing, demonstrate that BioMaster significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. By addressing key limitations in workflow automation, BioMaster offers a robust solution for modern bioinformatics challenges.

Ecdysone hormones play a crucial role in regulating the molting process of different ecdysozoan taxa. Interestingly, despite this highly conserved function of ecdysone, the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has lost the ecdysone receptor (ECR) genes and their molting appears to be ecdysone-independent. The loss of ecr has only been reported in Caenorhabditis within ecdysozoans, and the evolutionary background behind this loss has remained enigmatic. Here, we show that loss of ecr is not exceptional in Caenorhabditis, but has occurred at least three times in Rhabditina and Tylenchina nematodes. Our genome-wide analysis of 160 nematode species revealed the multiple losses of ecr and its typical heterodimer partner usp during nematode evolution. Furthermore, using genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we identified two factors that likely underlie and buffer the loss of ECR gene/function: molting regulation by an alternative nuclear receptor HR3 (NHR-23) and a lineage-specific expansion of nuclear receptors in the ecr-deficient taxa. Taken together, it is suggested that ecdysone/ECR function in nematodes is only minor or redundant. We propose a novel scenario for the evolution of molting regulation, highlighting the importance of HR3 as the potential core regulator.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

A key obstacle is the extracellular matrix (ECM) in solid tumors, which significantly impedes CAR T cell infiltration. In clinical trials, neuroblastoma (NB) has shown responsiveness to GD2-directed CAR T therapy, however, the failure of GD2.CAR Ts to effectively clear bulky disease - characterized by dense ECM - highlights the critical challenge of infiltration. In this study, we demonstrate that GD2.CAR Ts exhibit a unique infiltration-restriction compared to other CAR Ts and endogenous T cells. A separate analysis of clinical datasets identified MMP7 and SPP1 (OPN) as candidate genes to improve the infiltration of GD2.CAR Ts as these were upregulated in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. MMP-7 and OPN overexpression enhanced CAR T extravasation (p < .001) and interstitial movement (p < .05) in ECM-dense environments in vitro. Overexpression of either OPN (p < .0001) or MMP-7 (p < .001) improved tumor infiltration in a xenograft model of NB. This resulted in improved tumor control (94% reduction in tumor burden, p < .05) and a survival extension in OPN-GD2.CAR T treated mice compared to unmodified GD2.CAR Ts (median of 148 days, p < .05). OPN overexpression did not increase off-target infiltration into healthy tissues or promote tumor metastasis, highlighting its potential for safe therapeutic application.

We address this challenge through the lens of continuous-attractor networks, which model how neural circuits may represent continuous variables, such as head direction or spatial location, through collective dynamics. In classical continuous-attractor models, a continuous symmetry of the connectivity generates a manifold of stable states, resulting in tuning curves that are identical up to shifts. However, mouse head-direction cells show substantial heterogeneity in their responses that appears incompatible with this classical picture. To understand the mechanistic origin of these data, we use an optimization principle to construct recurrent-network models that match the observed responses while exhibiting quasi-continuous-attractor dynamics. To study how such systems scale with increasing numbers of neurons N, we develop a statistical generative process that produces artificial tuning curves that match many features of the experimental data quantitatively. Due to a continuous symmetry in the generative process, the connectivity matrix exhibits doublet degeneracy in its spectrum at large N, reflecting an underlying circular geometry. Unlike classical models, where the ring structure is embedded in the neuronal space through a structured Fourier embedding, our model uses a random, disordered embedding. Analysis of the network dynamics in the large-N limit through dynamical mean-field theory reveals that the system becomes equivalent to a classical ring-attractor model. We extend this approach to higher-dimensional symmetries, applying it to grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex and showing that the mean-field description recovers classical continuous-attractor models. Our work implies that large mammalian neural circuits could represent continuous variables using continuous-attractor dynamics, complete with continuous symmetry, in a way that is fully compatible with their heterogeneity and disorder.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

In Arabidopsis, responses to light are heavily regulated at the transcriptional level. Shade, for example, can limit photosynthesis and is rapidly perceived by phytochromes as a reduction of red to far-red light ratio (LRFR). Under shade, phytochromes become inactive, enabling PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs), particularly PIF7, to promote genome-wide reprogramming essential for LRFR responses. An initial strong and fast regulation of shade-responsive genes is followed by attenuation of this response under prolonged shade. We wanted to determine whether the transcriptional response to shade depends on chromatin accessibility. For this, we used ATAC-seq to profile the chromatin of seedlings exposed to short (1h) and long (25h) simulated shade. We found that PIF7 binding sites were accessible for most early target genes before LRFR treatment. The transcription pattern of most acute shade-responsive genes correlated with a rapid increase in PIF levels and chromatin association at 1h, and its decrease at 25h of shade exposure. For a small subset of acutely responding genes, PIFs also modulate chromatin accessibility at their binding sites early and/or late in the response to shade. Our results suggest that in seedlings a state of open chromatin conformation allows PIFs to easily access and recognize their binding motifs, rapidly initiating gene expression triggered by shade. This transcriptional response primarily depends on a transient increase in PIF stability and gene occupancy, accompanied by changes in chromatin accessibility in a minority of genes.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Inferring organism abundance or biomass from sequence counts derived from metabarcoding data has been an exciting but contentious concept in the biomonitoring community for some time. Although demonstrating a strong correlation with abundance has proven difficult, many researchers have assumed that quantitative metabarcoding data can at least provide broad-scale ranking of abundance. However, robust field validations of this widely-held assumption remain scarce.
C_LIO_LIHere, we analyse metabarcoding read counts of fish eDNA data derived from 20 lakes and use betabinomial mixed effects models to compare this to rank abundance generated from long-term fish survey data. Rank abundance data for 18 species was generated within-species across-sites, meaning that ranks compare the abundance of the same species in different lakes. We also investigated a possible allometric effect on eDNA production by analysing a subset of data for effects of fish body mass on the amount of eDNA sequences.
C_LIO_LIWe found a good relationship between species-specific eDNA sequences and within-species rank abundance categories for fishes, with rare fish producing 3% of sequences in a library, moderately abundant producing 7% and abundant fish producing 29%, according to model predictions.
C_LIO_LIWe found a small negative effect of body mass on the amount of eDNA sequences, where the proportion of reads recovered significantly decreased with increased mean body mass of the population.
C_LIO_LISynthesis and applications: The benefit of this approach is the potential for rapid assessment of rank abundance for multiple species, including smaller species which are often missed by conventional methods such as gillnetting, with relatively low amounts of additional effort.

Here we characterized the immune related cell program in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a model organism representing the phylum Cnidaria that diverged ~600 million years ago from the rest of animals. By using a Nematostella transgenic reporter line expressing mCherry under the RLRb antiviral promoter we show that cells fluorescent upon stimulation with the viral mimic poly(I:C) are morphologically and transcriptomically distinct. These cells exhibit upregulation of immune effector and regulator genes. Cellular assays revealed an increase in phagocytic activity upon poly(I:C) treatment in this cell population. Lastly, we used a combination of immunofluorescent staining followed by FACS and bulk RNA sequencing, accompanied by single-cell transcriptomic analysis, to reveal the gene regulatory programs associated with immune cells in Nematostella. Comparing the sea anemone immune expression profile with gene expression of stony corals treated with the immunostimulant 2'3'-Cyclic GMP-AMP revealed remarkable similarity, suggesting that the immune response to viral challenge is conserved across the cnidarian class Hexacorallia. Altogether, this research uncovers the characteristics of a novel cnidarian immune cell type involved in antiviral immunity and offers insights into the evolutionary history of the innate immune system.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

However, such synthesis depends on the integration of vast amounts of mostly scattered and often hard-to-extract information that is published and dispersed across hundreds of thousands of scientific papers, for example describing species-specific interactions and trophic relationships. Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and in particular the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offer a novel, and potentially revolutionary solution to this persistent challenge, for the first time creating the opportunity to access and extract virtually all data ever published. Here, we demonstrate the transformative potential of LLMs by extracting all types of biological interactions among species directly from a corpus of 83,910 scientific articles. Our approach successfully extracted a network of 144,402 interactions between 36,471 taxa. Performance analysis shows that the model exhibits a high sensitivity (70.0%) and excellent precision (89.5%). Our approach proves that LLMs are capable of carrying out complex extraction tasks on key ecological data on a very large scale, paving the way for a multitude of potential applications in ecology and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

However, existing computational models often struggle to incorporate essential biological knowledge, handle sparse and noisy data, and scale effectively across large datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce RegFormer, a novel foundation model specifically designed for scRNA-seq analysis. RegFormer integrates hierarchical relationships from gene regulatory networks (GRNs) through an innovative architecture based on Mamba Blocks, enabling more effective modeling of gene interactions and cellular states. Pretrained on a vast dataset of 22 million human cells and comprising approximately 50 million parameters, RegFormer employs dual embeddings to separately capture gene expression levels and gene identities. This approach enhances interpretability by aligning gene expression data with regulatory hierarchies, offering more precise biological insights. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that RegFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, such as scGPT, Geneformer, scFoundation, and scBERT, across a wide range of tasks, including cell annotation, GRN construction, genetic perturbation prediction, and drug response prediction. By combining cutting-edge deep learning techniques with biological knowledge, RegFormer not only improves accuracy and interpretability but also provides deeper insights into cellular processes and regulatory mechanisms, positioning it as a powerful tool for advancing biological discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Long-lived, resident tissue macrophages concentrated in the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal, whereas short-lived monocyte-derived macrophages, instead, were abundant around distal vessels. Specific depletion of resident tissue macrophages triggered elevated intraocular pressure and outflow resistance, linked to aberrant extracellular matrix turnover in the resistance-generating tissues of the trabecular meshwork.

Orofacial movements must be coordinated with rhythmic breathing to avoid aspiration and because they share muscles. Understanding how brainstem circuits coordinate rhythmic motor programs requires neurophysiological measurements in behaving animals. We used Neuropixels probe recordings to map brainstem neural activity related to breathing, licking, and swallowing in mice drinking water. Breathing and licking rhythms were tightly coordinated and phase-locked, whereas intermittent swallowing paused breathing and licking. Multiple clusters of neurons, each recruited during different orofacial rhythms, delineated a lingual premotor network in the intermediate nucleus of the reticular formation (IRN). Local optogenetic perturbation experiments identified a region in the IRN where constant stimulation can drive sustained rhythmic licking, consistent with a central pattern generator for licking. Stimulation to artificially induce licking showed that coupled brainstem oscillators autonomously coordinated licking and breathing. The brainstem oscillators were further patterned by descending inputs at moments of licking initiation. Our results reveal the logic governing interactions of orofacial rhythms during behavior and outline their neural circuit dynamics, providing a model for dissecting multi-oscillator systems controlling rhythmic motor programs.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Methods: In this randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial, several possible treatments were compared with usual care in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 pneumonia. In the sotrovimab comparison, eligible and consenting patients were randomly allocated to either usual care alone or usual care plus a single 1g dose of sotrovimab, using web-based unstratified randomisation. Participants were retrospectively categorised according to their baseline serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen concentration as high-antigen or low-antigen, using the median concentration as a cut-off. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality assessed by intention to treat. Secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital, and, among those not on invasive ventilation at baseline, progression to invasive ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding ended. ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936). Findings: From 4 January 2022 to 19 March 2024, 1723 patients were recruited to the sotrovimab comparison. 720 (42%) were classified as high-antigen, 717 (42%) as low-antigen, and 286 (17%) had unknown antigen status. Over 80% of patients were vaccinated, over 80% had anti-spike antibodies at randomisation, and almost all were infected with Omicron variants. In the prespecified primary efficacy population of high-antigen patients, 82/355 (23%) allocated sotrovimab versus 106/365 (29%) allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.56-0.99; p=0.046). In an analysis of all randomised patients (regardless of antigen status), 177/828 (21%) allocated sotrovimab versus 201/895 (22%) allocated usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.77-1.16; p=0.60). Interpretation: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, sotrovimab was associated with reduced mortality in the primary analysis population of patients with a high serum SARS-CoV-2 antigen concentration at baseline, but not in the overall population.","NA","medrxiv",1738102079229

Here, we show that the use of ESM-2 protein embeddings explains this performance gain irrespective of model architecture. We compared the performance of models with varying complexity, per-protein, and per-token embeddings, as well as the influence of self- or cross-attention, where all models plateaued at an accuracy of 0.65.

Mtb exhibits heterogeneity in redox metabolism inside macrophages to evade killing by anti-TB drugs. If and how macrophage physiology correlates with bacterial redox heterogeneity and drug tolerance remains unclear. Using a fluorescent reporter of mycobacterial redox potential, flow sorting, and RNA sequencing of infected macrophages, we characterized transcriptional and metabolic responses of macrophages harboring redox-diverse Mtb populations. We found that macrophages with suppressed glycolysis and elevated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) correlated with Mtb populations exhibiting reductive stress and drug tolerance. Conversely, macrophages with elevated glycolysis and suppressed OXPHOS displayed higher mitochondrial reactive oxygen species through reverse electron transport, resulting in oxidative stress in Mtb and enhancing drug efficacy. Computational and genetic approaches identified Nrf2 as a key regulator of macrophage bioenergetics driving redox heterogeneity and drug tolerance in Mtb. Redirecting macrophage metabolism from OXPHOS to glycolysis using an FDA- approved antiemetic drug, meclizine, subverted redox heterogeneity and diminished drug tolerance in macrophages and mice. The pharmacological profile of meclizine (Cmax and AUClast) indicated no adverse interactions with first-line anti-TB drugs in mice.

Here, we studied the effects of highly pleiotropic point mutations in Escherichia coli over a 15,000-generation adaptive trajectory. The fitness effects of both beneficial and deleterious mutations were attenuated with increased adaptation over time. In contrast, pleiotropic effects in new environments became more severe and widespread with greater adaptation.

Of the 23 sequence modifications tested, two induced the DNA duplex to adopt a Z-like left-handed conformation under physiological salt conditions, bypassing the specific sequences typically required for a left-handed Z-DNA structure. The impact of these modifications varied with the linker type: flexible propyl linkers exhibited distinct effects compared to rigid propargyl linkers. Notably, modifications positioned directly on or near a restriction site emphasized the pivotal role of linker rigidity in controlling DNA conformation. Specifically, the conformational change induced by the flexible linker impacted nuclease and restriction endonuclease cleavage, reducing sequence specificity. In contrast, the rigid linker suppressed this effect. Furthermore, our findings indicate that nucleic acid duplexes modified with indole-linked nucleotides using a flexible propyl linker have a pronounced tendency to form BZ or Z-like regions in longer DNA sequences. A higher density of modifications may even induce a full Z-like conformation throughout the duplex.

Many of these functions are upregulated on demand, therefore cells control peroxisome abundance, and by extension peroxisome function, in response to environmental and developmental cues. The mechanisms upregulating peroxisomes in mammalian cells have remained unclear. Here we identify a signaling regulatory network and a mechanism that coordinate cellular demand for peroxisomes and peroxisome abundance by regulating peroxisome proliferation. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) promotes peroxisome PEX11b-dependent formation. PKC activation leads to an increase in peroxisome formation, promoting peroxisome-ER contact site formation through inactivation of GSK3{beta}. We show that removal of VAPA and VAPB impairs peroxisome biogenesis and PKC regulation. Inhibition of PKC reduces peroxisome-ER interactions, leading to a decrease in peroxisome abundance. During neuronal differentiation, active PKC leads to a significant increase in peroxisome formation. We propose that peroxisomal regulation by transient active PKC signaling enables rapid and fine-tuned responses to the need for peroxisomal activity.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

Cell competition (CC) is a cell non-autonomous quality control in which ""winner"" cells eliminate viable but suboptimal ""loser"" cells based on their relative difference in fitness. Due to its central role in fitness perception, loss of p53 results in the emergence of ""supercompetitor"" cells, which stand at the apex of cell competition and induce apoptosis in neighboring wild-type (WT) cells.

Here, we investigate CC dynamics using mosaic 3D mouse gastruloids, an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based in vitro model of gastrulation, composed of defined numbers of WT and p53-KO cells. In mosaic gastruloids, even low numbers of p53-KO cells robustly outcompete WT cells, and introduction of as few as two p53-KO cells is sufficient to measurably impair neighboring WT cell growth. CC in gastruloids is independent of cell proliferation rates, nutrient availability, or reactive oxygen species (ROS), and not influenced by Nodal and ERK signaling. However, we observe that Wnt and BMP signaling protect from CC, which is exclusively driven by intrinsic apoptosis, as indicated by Bcl2-mediated complete rescue of WT cells. During gastruloid development, CC is temporally restricted to a window of 48-96 hours after aggregation, mirroring embryonic days E5.5-E7.5 in the mouse. Heterochronic mosaic gastruloid experiments demonstrate that relative differences in pluripotency levels are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause supercompetition, but that CC is contingent on both competitors residing within the developmental window permissive to CC. Neither pluripotent mosaic 3D aggregates, nor 3D EpiGastruloids, which model more advanced developmental processes, display any competition, supporting the hypothesis that developmental CC is specific to the onset of gastrulation. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms of cell fitness evaluation in mammalian embryogenesis and establish gastruloids as a powerful 3D model for investigating developmental stage-specific cell competition.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

New treatment options are thus required. Even though HLA expression in neuroblastoma is low and immune cell infiltrates are limited, the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is indicative for better patient survival. Here, we show that most tumor lesions contain viable immune cell infiltrates after induction chemotherapy, with high percentages of CD3+ T cells. We therefore expanded the TILs and tested their anti-tumoral activity. With sufficient starting material, TIL expansion was as efficient as for adult solid tumors. However, whereas TIL products from adult tumors almost exclusively contained {beta} T cells, in neuroblastoma-derived TILs, {gamma}{delta} T cells expanded with similar efficacy as {beta} T cells. Importantly, the anti-tumor responses in response to autologous tumor digest primarily originated from (V{delta}1- and V{delta}3-expressing) {gamma}{delta} T cells, and not from {beta} T cells. In conclusion, this finding creates a window of opportunity for immunotherapy for neuroblastoma patients, with {gamma}{delta} T cells as potential prime responders.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

We established genome acceptability criteria and determined the performance characteristics of the panel including assay sensitivity, specificity, breadth of genome recovery, accuracy, and precision using contrived and remnant clinical specimens. High-quality genomes (>95% genome completeness; >500X and >1000X average depth for whole genome and fusion gene respectively) were recovered from samples with Ct [&le;] 30 (~594 and 2,004 copies per reaction for RSV-A and RSV-B respectively). Minor variants were accurately identified in sample mixtures of 5:95 and higher. The assay showed high accuracy when compared against Sanger, shotgun metagenomic, and hybridization capture-based sequencing; and high repeatability and reproducibility. The UW-ARTIC RSV panel has utility in genomic surveillance, clinical and research applications. It has been used to generate FDA-reportable data for clinical trials of RSV antiviral products, with robust performance characteristics in samples from around the globe from as recently as the 2023/24 season.

Fungi encode genes with features similar to non-self recognition systems in plants, animals, and bacteria. However, limited functional or mechanistic evidence exists for the surveillance-system recognition of heterologous microbes in fungi. We found that Neurospora species coexist with Pseudomonas in their natural environment. We leveraged two model organisms, Neurospora crassa and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PSTDC3000) to observe immediate fungal responses to bacteria. PSTDC3000 preferentially surrounds N. crassa cells on a solid surface, causing environmental dependent growth responses, bacterial proliferation and varying fungal fitness. Specifically, the Type III secretion system (T3SS) {Delta}hrcC mutant of PSTDC3000 colonized N. crassa hyphae less well. To dissect initial cellular signaling events within the population of germinated asexual spores (germlings), we performed transcriptomics on N. crassa after PSTDC3000 inoculation. Upon contact with live bacteria, a subpopulation of fungal germlings initiate a response as early as ten minutes post-contact revealing transcriptional differentiation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) mechanisms, trace metal warfare, cell wall remodeling dynamics, multidrug-efflux transporters, secondary metabolite synthesis, and excretion. We dissected mutants of plausible receptors, signaling pathways, and responses that N. crassa uses to detect and mount a defense against PSTDC3000 and found seven genes that influence resistant and susceptibility phenotypes of N. crassa to bacterial colonization. Mutants in genes encoding a ctr copper transporter (tcu-1), ferric reductase (fer-1), superoxide reductase (sod-2), multidrug resistance transporter (mdr-6), a secreted lysozyme-Glycoside hydrolase (lyz) and the Woronin body tether leashin (NCU02793, lah-1 and lah-2) showed a significant reduction of growth in the presence of bacteria, allowing the bacteria to fully take over the fungal mycelium faster than wildtype. In this study we provide a bacterial-fungal model system within Dikarya that allows us to begin to dissect signaling pathways of the putative fungal immune system.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

SOMs occur seasonally and are hypothesized to result from elevated microbial net primary productivity (NPP). Here, we set out to identify mechanistic drivers of the SOM near the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) site in the Sargasso Sea in October 2019. Coupled time-series analysis of metatranscriptomics, flow cytometry, and family-specific cyanophage quantification revealed elevated Prochlorococcus abundances, cyanophage abundances, and cyanophage-specific transcriptional activity in the SOM. These findings spurred us to analyze historical oxygen saturation profiles at BATS - identifying a repeated, seasonal cycle in SOM emergence associated with elevated virus-like particles and Prochlorococcus numbers. Returning to the 2019 study site, we found that transcriptional markers for increased dissolved organic matter uptake by copiotrophic bacteria were enriched in the SOM, consistent with enhanced catabolic activity due to the viral shunt. In addition, Prochlorococcus exhibited enrichment in ammonium transport transcripts at the SOM, consistent with increased responsiveness to remineralization activity by heterotrophs. Altogether, these findings suggest that enhanced viral lysis leads to locally elevated nutrient recycling and oxygen production, further reinforcing hypotheses that viruses may play a critical role in the emergence of SOMs in the oligotrophic ocean.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1738102079229

Compared to their shallower counterpart, MCEs have been traditionally understudied, primarily due to their inaccessibility with traditional monitoring methodologies. In this study, we aim to provide an interdisciplinary assessment of the biodiversity of Bermudan reef fish communities from the upper/lower mesophotic interface (60 m) by utilising a combination of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and baited remote underwater videos (BRUVs). In total, 155 species from 137 genera were detected by eDNA metabarcoding whilst a total of 85 species from 53 genera were detected by BRUVs. The combined species detections totalled 182 species with approximately half of those detections unique to this study when compared to previous studies. Both methodologies found differences in alpha diversity between study locations, with each method independently detecting the highest species richness at the same location. The species assemblage at each location was dominated (~80%) by species known to occur throughout the shallow reef system and the upper mesophotic, whilst species only known to inhabit mesophotic ecosystems accounted for ~6% at each location. These findings suggest a high level of species continuity with the adjacent shallower reef systems. The complementary nature of eDNA metabarcoding and BRUVs allows for a more accurate characterisation of fish biodiversity at the upper/lower mesophotic interface, which can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of ecosystem structure and more informed management decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1738102079229

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years.
