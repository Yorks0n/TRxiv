Since therapeutic research is ongoing, long COVID prevention is a pragmatic public health strategy. While prior analyses have shown the benefit of primary vaccination, the effect of booster vaccination on preventing long COVID caused by an Omicron infection has not been fully investigated. This systematic review identified 31 observational studies, among which 11 were deemed suitable for pairwise meta-analyses. Herein, the pooled risk of long COVID was 22-29% (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively) lower for vaccinated (any vaccination) populations versus unvaccinated (10 studies); 19% (P<0.0001) lower for primary course vaccination versus no vaccination (3 studies); 26% (P<0.0001) lower for booster vaccination versus no vaccination (4 studies) and 23% (P=0.0044) lower for booster vaccination versus primary course vaccination (3 studies). These findings indicate that booster vaccination can provide additional protection against long COVID; thereby, highlighting the importance of seasonal vaccination against new SARS-CoV-2 variants.","NA","medrxiv",1732399746624

This review investigates whether excess weight increases the risk of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with PCC. Methods: Studies published up to July 2023 were searched independently across eight electronic databases to evaluate the risk of developing neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms more than 12 weeks post-infection between exposure and controls groups (excess weight vs. normal weight; obesity vs. non-obesity). Meta-analyses were conducted under a random-effects model. Results: Of the 10,122 abstracts screened, 18 studies (n = 139,091 adults) met the inclusion criteria and reported PCC symptoms according to nutritional status. These studies included 79,050 individuals with excess weight vs 57,926 normal-weight individuals and 30,694 individuals with obesity vs 107,612 non-obese individuals. The presence of excess weight in PCC significantly increased the risk of depression (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.03-1.42), headache (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09-1.35), memory issues (RR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.24-1.65), sleep disturbance (RR = 1.31; 95% CI: 1.16-1.48), and vertigo (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04- 1.41). Obesity significantly increased the risk of headache (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.34- 1.49), smell disorder (RR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09-1.21), taste disorder (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.07-1.36), and vertigo (RR = 1.44; 95% CI: 1.35-1.53). Conclusions: Excess weight or obesity increases the risk of experiencing neuro-symptoms related to PCC.

The capability for producing custom-shape high-quality backbones for very large proteins would further expand the scope of protein design. To this end, here we introduce the AlphaFold2 (AF2) cycler (af2cycler) design pipeline. AF2cycler is used to refine draft protein backbone geometries of arbitrary shape created by the Chroma diffusion model or other methods, using a combination of AF2 and ProteinMPNN to achieve high designability with minimal deviations from the initial target structure. In silico testing on multiple protein designs (100-1000 amino acids) demonstrated improvements in structural integrity and designability after af2cycling confirmed by enhanced ESMFold repredictions. Experimental wet lab validation through the design of a variety of test proteins with distinct shapes, each comprising 1000 amino acids, showed structural agreement between in silico predictions and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging, establishing the af2cycler's efficacy in translating designs into real-world results. Af2cycler provides a convenient and reliable protein design workflow, particularly for large proteins, with potential for expanding to applications in areas such as design of higher-order protein complexes and multi-state backbone optimization.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brains large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Recent studies have suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood.

Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post- hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue.

Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID- 19 and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Using a computational approach that maximises phylogenetic diversity, we selected an optimal subset of 40 alphacoronavirus spike proteins, including the two human viruses NL63 and 229E, and characterised their host-range using broad mammalian APN and ACE2 receptor libraries. Based on this data, we were able to determine molecular genotypes that contribute to receptor tropism and identify alphacoronaviruses with broad (generalist) or restricted (specialist) receptor usage. Strikingly, we observed that generalism and specialism can vary significantly between closely related viruses. Using structural information, we identified key residues that determine the bat tropism of 229E-like viruses, as well as residues in the ACE2 receptor that likely restrict NL63 infection of certain mammals. Furthermore, we observed that the host range of certain bat alphacoronaviruses is expanded by TMPRSS2 priming of spike. All APN- and ACE2-using alphaCoVs in our study interacted with the receptor of at least one animal species within ecological proximity to humans, suggesting new routes for spillover. However, most bat alphacoronaviruses did not use any of receptors in our screen, refining our understanding of coronavirus entry. We propose a new approach to investigating receptor usage for viral orders/families/genera, which is not constrained by focused analysis of a limited number of sequences from human-tropic viruses. Understanding phenotypic traits, such as entry, at this genus-wide level can revolutionise our ability to predict zoonotic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Biased compounds that selectively activate therapy-relevant pathways promise to be safer, more effective medications. The determinants of bias are poorly understood, however, and rationally-designed, G protein-subtype-selective compounds are lacking. Here, using the prototypical class A GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), we find that small molecules binding the intracellular GPCR-transducer interface change G protein coupling by subtype-specific and predictable mechanisms, enabling rational drug design. We demonstrate that the compound SBI-553 switches NTSR1 G protein preference by acting both as a molecular bumper and a molecular glue. Structurally, SBI-553 occludes G protein binding determinants on NTSR1, promoting association with select G protein subtypes for which an alternative, shallow-binding conformation is energetically favorable. Minor modifications to the SBI-553 scaffold produce allosteric modulators with distinct G protein subtype selectivity profiles. Selectivity profiles are probe-independent, conserved across species, and translate to differences in in vivo activity. These studies demonstrate that G protein selectivity can be tailored with small changes to a single chemical scaffold targeting the receptor-transducer interface and, as this pocket is broadly conserved, present a strategy for pathway-selective drug discovery applicable to the diverse GPCR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

ResultsA total of 120 209 (4.8%) deliveries were exposed to maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy. Maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy was associated with increased odds of stillbirth (adjusted pooled OR (aOR) 1.16, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.28), preterm delivery (aOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.30), and Apgar score < 7 at 5 minutes (aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.75 to 1.91). These findings persisted in the discordant sibling analysis, but with higher uncertainty. The adjusted predicted absolute risk for stillbirth was 0.34% (95% CI 0.33 to 0.35) among the unexposed and 0.40% (95% CI 0.36 to 0.44) in the antidepressant exposed. Restricting to women with depression or anxiety, the association between antidepressant exposure and stillbirth attenuated (aOR 1.07, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.21). Paternal antidepressant use was modestly associated with preterm delivery and low Apgar score. Most antidepressants were associated with preterm delivery (except paroxetine) and Apgar score (except mirtazapine and amitriptyline).

ConclusionsMaternal antidepressant use during pregnancy may increase the risk of stillbirth, preterm delivery, and low Apgar score, although the absolute risks remained low. Confounding by severity of indication cannot be ruled out, as the severity of symptoms was not available. The modest association between paternal antidepressant use and both preterm delivery and low Apgar score suggests that residual confounding by familial environment cannot be ruled out.","NA","medrxiv",1732399746625

Electrical communication between qNSCs and neurons enables this precise spatial and temporal control of reactivation throughout the entire span of the CNS. Using single-cell RNA-seq we discovered that, remarkably, qNSCs switch on a host of neuronal genes while maintaining a stem cell identity. This transient mixed identity is specific to qNSCs, as neuronal genes are turned off after stem cells resume proliferation. Our results uncover long-range communication between qNSCs to coordinate reactivation, enabled by a transient stem cell-neuron fate.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

To control the infection with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron JN.1 subvariants, JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines have been developed. Some previous reports showed that the JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine of Pfizer/BioNTech (US/Germany) increased antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC. However, the efficacy of other available JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccines (e.g., Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) remains unassessed. To validate the antiviral efficacy induced by JN.1 mRNA vaccines, sera were collected from individuals vaccinated with Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=15) or Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 mRNA vaccine (N=19) before and 3-4 weeks after vaccination. We then performed a neutralization assay using these sera and pseudoviruses. Both Pfizer/BioNTech JN.1 vaccine (2.4-to 8.0-fold, P=0.0001) and Daiichi-Sankyo JN.1 vaccine (2.3-to 13-fold, P=0.0001) boosted antiviral humoral immunity against all variants tested with statistical significance. While the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine encodes the full-length JN.1 spike (S), the Daiichi-Sankyo mRNA vaccine encodes the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding domain of JN.1 S can effectively induce antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 subvariants and XEC comparable to the full-length JN.1 S. However, it should be considered that the sizes of our cohorts are relatively small (<20 donors per cohort), and donor characteristics, such as age, sex, underlying disease status, and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, may critically affect the experimental results. Future investigations with larger cohorts will address this concern. When compared to vaccination with JN.1 mRNA vaccines, our previous investigations showed that the natural infection of JN.1 and KP.3.3 elicited poorer antiviral humoral immunity against JN.1 and its subvariants. Our results suggest that the JN.1 mRNA vaccination more robustly induces antiviral humoral immunity against recent JN.1 subvariants than the natural infection of JN.1 subvariants regardless of manufacturer. Moreover, as we reported last year, the humoral immunity induced by XBB.1.5 monovalent mRNA vaccine against XBB.1.5 was weaker than that against ancestral B.1.1. However, in the case of JN.1 monovalent mRNA vaccine, here we showed that the 50% neutralization titer against XBB.1.5 is greater than that against ancestral B.1.1. These observations imply that immune imprinting has shifted from that biased toward pre-Omicron to that biased toward Omicron, depending on the time and/or number of immune stimuli (e.g., infection and/or vaccination).","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

We identified ten significantly associated loci, of which six were novel (SLITRK1, SYN3, IGSF11, FSHB, TCF7L2, and CDH9), and confirmed previous genome-wide significant associations with risk genes GDF15, IGFBP7, PGR, and GFRAL. In a spatiotemporal analysis of placental development, GDF15 and TCF7L2 were expressed primarily in extra villous trophoblast, and using a weighted linear model of maternal, paternal, and fetal effects, we confirmed opposing effects for GDF15 between maternal and fetal genotype. Conversely, IGFBP7 and PGR were primarily expressed in developing maternal spiral arteries during placentation, with effects limited to the maternal genome. Risk loci were found to be under significant evolutionary selection, with the strongest effects on nausea and vomiting mid-pregnancy. Selected loci were associated with abnormal pregnancy weight gain, pregnancy duration, birth weight, head circumference, and pre-eclampsia. Potential roles for candidate genes in appetite, insulin signaling, and brain plasticity provide new pathways to explore etiological mechanisms and novel therapeutic avenues.","NA","medrxiv",1732399746625

In contrast with the dorso-ventrally flat Drosophila wing, its serial homolog the haltere adopts a globular shape thought to arise from a lack of matrix-mediated adhesion between its dorsal and ventral surfaces. Contradicting this model, however, matrix manipulations are known to deform halteres. To understand haltere morphogenesis, we characterized matrix behavior and monitored metamorphic development of the haltere. We found that, similar to the wing, correct haltere morphogenesis requires Collagen IV degradation, which we show is mediated by ecdysone-controlled expression of Matrix metalloprotease 2 in both wing and haltere. After Collagen IV is degraded, similar again to the wing, dorsal and ventral haltere surfaces establish Laminin-mediated contact through long cytoskeletal projections. Furthermore, time-lapse analysis of shape changes in wild type and mutant halteres indicates that these projections couple the two surfaces through a central tensor, ensuring load distribution across the whole organ to create a globular shape against tissue-wide deforming forces. Our findings reveal an unexpected role for matrix-mediated adhesion in haltere morphogenesis and describe a novel type of matrix-based tensor structure building 3D shape from 2D epithelia.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Since 2009, successful hoaxes usually appeared at a year of one or more a year, usually motivated by academics or journalists exposing so-called ""predatory"" journals. The apparent rise in the number of hoaxes reflects a lack of transparency in editorial processes at both legitimate and ""predatory"" journals.

Barrier formation requires positioning of functional tight junctions (TJ) to the most suprabasal viable layer of the epidermis through a mechanical circuit that is driven by generation of high tension at adherens junctions. However, what allows the sensing of tension build-up at these adhesions and how this tension is balanced to match the requirements of tissue mechanical properties is unclear. Here we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional, continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension. In vivo, Piezo1 function in adhesion integrity becomes essential only in aged mice where alterations in tissue mechanics lead to impaired TJs and barrier dysfunction. Collectively these studies reveal an essential function of Piezo1 in the timely establishment and maintenance of cell-cell junctions in the context of a mechanically tensed epidermis.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

However, these regions are often implicitly one-dimensional, making standard two-dimensional coordinate-based methods less effective as they overlook the underlying tissue organization. Here we introduce a methodology grounded in spectral graph theory to elucidate a one-dimensional curve that effectively approximates the spatial coordinates of the examined sample. This curve is then used to establish a new coordinate system that better reflects tissue morphology. We then develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to detect genes with variable expression in the new morphologically relevant coordinate system. Our approach directly models gene counts, thereby eliminating the need for normalization or transformations to satisfy normality assumptions. We demonstrate improved performance relative to current methods based on hypothesis testing, while also accurately estimating gene expression patterns and precisely identifying spatial loci where deviations from constant expression are observed. We validate our approach through extensive simulations and by analyzing experimental data from multiple platforms such as Slide-seq and MERFISH.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Variation in phage plaque morphology does not to reliably distinguish distinct phages and therefore many potentially redundant phages may need to be isolated, purified, and individually characterized to find phages of interest. Here, we present a method in which multiple bacterial strains are co-cultured on the same screening plate to add an extra dimension to plaque morphology data. In this method, Phage Discovery by Co-culture (Phage DisCo), strains are isogenic except for fluorescent tags and one perturbation expected to impact phage infection. Differential plaquing on the strains is easily detectable by fluorescent signal and implies that the perturbation made to the surviving strain in a plaque prevents phage infection. We validate the Phage DisCo method by showing that characterized phages have the expected plaque morphology on Phage DisCo plates and demonstrate the power of Phage DisCo for multiple targeted discovery applications, from receptors to phage defense systems.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Crucially, fMRI is vital for studying subcortical areas, as those are practically out of reach for conventional EEG. At the same time, EEG is cost-effective and, thus, often preferable to fMRI if comparable information could be extracted which is not the case then the deep subcortical brain activity is of interest. Here we explore the possibility of recovering subcortical hemodynamics from the non-invasively recorded scalp EEG signals. To this end, we have developed a lightweight EEG-to-fMRI neural network and using an extended and publicly available dataset with concurrently recorded EEG-fMRI data show that our model allows for the prediction of the detailed Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity of 7 bilaterally symmetric subcortical structures solely from multichannel EEG data. We report the performance significantly above chance and exceeding the scores achieved for a single subcortical structure and obtained on the proprietary datasets. In contrast to the studies focusing on a single subcortical region in our approach we were able to decode multichannel EEG into 14 + 4 region-specific variations of BOLD signals measured relative to their mean hemodynamic activity. The use of relative BOLD signals allowed us to exert control over the artificial inflation of decoding accuracy scores when the decoder predicts the common mode component that is likely to have a non-neuronal origin (heartbeat, movement, etc). Finally, we interpreted our model. The electrical activity of the sensorimotor cortex appeared to contribute most to the prediction of the subcortical hemodynamics. Also, the hemodynamics of the thalamus has the smallest delay with respect to the EEG signals. Both observations are physiologically plausible and ensure the potential reliability of the decoder. Taken together, these findings pave the road towards the creation of low-cost AI-powered EEG-based fMRI digital twin technology capable of tracking subcortical activity in an ecological setting. The technology, once mature, will find numerous applications from fundamental neuroscience through diagnostics to neurorehabilitation and affective neurointerfaces.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

We have previously observed that laser flash melting and revitrification of cryo samples reduces preferred orientation for large, symmetric particles. Here, we demonstrate that our method can in fact be used to scramble the orientation of proteins of a range of sizes and symmetries. The effect can be enhanced for some proteins by increasing the heating rate during flash melting or by depositing amorphous ice onto the sample prior to revitrification. This also allows us to shed light onto the underlying mechanism.

The ADMIXTURE software is a widely used model-based approach to account for population stratification, however, it struggles with convergence issues and does not scale to modern human datasets or the large number of variants in whole-genome sequencing data. Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy in the ancestry estimates in more complex admixture scenarios. We present a new model-based approach, fastmixture, which adopts aspects from likelihood-free approaches for parameter initialization, followed by a mini-batch expectation-maximization procedure to model the standard likelihood. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model-based approaches of fastmixture and ADMIXTURE are significantly more accurate than recent and likelihood-free approaches. We further show that fastmixture runs approximately 30x faster than ADMIXTURE on both simulated and empirical data from the 1000 Genomes Project such that our model-based approach scales to much larger sample sizes than previously possible.

Here, we characterize the mechanisms that drive the formation of these structures and their function in gene regulation in a lymphoid-to-myeloid differentiation system. Based on analyses at base-pair resolution, we demonstrate a close correlation between binding of regulatory proteins, formation of chromatin interactions, and gene expression. Integration of single-allele topologies and computational modeling shows that tissue-specific gene loci are organized into chromatin hubs, characterized by cooperative interactions between multiple enhancers, promoters, and CTCF-binding sites. Depletion of CTCF strongly impairs the formation of these structures, but has mild effects on gene expression, which can be explained by rewired enhancer-promoter interactions. This demonstrates an instructive role for enhancer-promoter interactions in gene regulation that is independent of cooperative interactions in chromatin hubs. Together, these results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of the structure-function relationship of the genome during cellular differentiation.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1732399746625

Moreover, multiple zoonotic infections in humans have been reported. Importantly, HPAI H5N1 viruses with genetic markers of adaptation to mammals have been detected. Together with HPAI H5N1, avian influenza viruses H7N9 (high and low pathogenic) stand out due to their high mortality rates in humans. This raises the question of how prepared we are serologically and whether seasonal vaccines are capable of inducing protective immunity against these influenza subtypes. An observational study was conducted in which sera from people born between years 1925-1967, 1968-1977, and 1978-1997 were collected before or after 28 days or 6 months post-vaccination with an inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Then, haemagglutination inhibition, viral neutralization, and immunoassays were performed to assess the basal protective immunity of the population as well as the ability of seasonal influenza vaccines to induce protective responses. Our results indicate that subtype-specific serological protection against H5N1 and H7N9 in the representative Spanish population evaluated was limited or nonexistent. However, seasonal vaccination was able to increase the antibody titers to protective levels in a moderate percentage of people, probably due to cross-reactive responses. These findings demonstrate the importance of vaccination and suggest that seasonal influenza vaccines could be used as a first line of defense against an eventual pandemic caused by avian influenza viruses, to be followed immediately by the use of more specific pandemic vaccines.

ImportanceInfluenza A viruses (IAV) can infect and replicate in multiple mammalian and avian species. Avian influenza virus (AIV) is a highly contagious viral disease that occurs primarily in poultry and wild water birds. Due to the lack of population immunity in humans and ongoing evolution of AIV, there is a continuing risk that new IAV could emerge and rapidly spread worldwide causing a pandemic, if the ability to transmit efficiently among humans was gained. The aim of this study is to analyze the basal protection and presence of antibodies against IAV H5N1, and H7N9 subtypes in the population from different ages. Moreover, we have evaluated the h humoral response after immunization with a seasonal influenza vaccine. This study is strategically important to evaluate the level of population immunity that is a major factor when assessing the impact that an emerging IAV strain would have, and the role of seasonal vaccines to mitigate the effects of a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and its deficiency induces extensive reprogramming of growth and defense strategies in plants. This process involves Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PHR1), a master regulator of the Phosphate Starvation Response (PSR). In this study, we identify a novel, non-canonical role for TORC1 in regulating P starvation responses in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that P limitation activates TORC1, leading to the stabilization of PHR1. Inhibition of TORC1 increased sensitivity to P starvation, accompanied by disruption of starvation-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Additionally, our results reveal that the TORC1-PHR1 signaling axis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the expression of genes involved in the plant immune signaling network. This regulation is critical for the symbiotic association with the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica under P starvation. These findings underscore the significant role of the TORC1-PHR1 module in orchestrating the PSR and highlight the evolutionary adaptation of TORC1 signaling pathways in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

However, we show that organelle boundaries, which are important for defining MCS, are the least confident predictions made by AI. We outline a segmentation strategy termed AI-directed Voxel Extraction (AIVE), that combines AI predictions with image electron signals to confidently segment membrane boundaries irrespective of the AI model used. We demonstrate the precision conferred by AIVE by applying it to the quantitative analysis of organelle interactomes from multiple FIB-SEM datasets.

Without voluntary practice related to anthropic mummification, as will be seen with the Egyptian Dynastic empires, human remains from this period were naturally mummified because of the natural environmental conditions, possibly enveloped in plant mats and animal skins. This study focuses on four mummies from the Natural History Museum of Musee des Confluences in Lyon (France). The geographic origin of the mummies and climatic conditions at that time were deduced from {delta}18O measurements on teeth and bones. These measurements confirm that the primary source of drinking water was the Nile, and that one mummy of unknown origin also originated from Upper Egypt like the other three. The diet and life habits of these individuals were inferred from carbon ({delta}13C), nitrogen ({delta}15N) and sulfur ({delta}34S) isotope compositions of their skins and bone collagens. Our study is of particular interest as we were able to analyse the animal skins and plant material enveloping the mummies using the same isotopic systems. The mean {delta}15N values obtained in human skins (17.9{+/-}2.4{per thousand}, AIR) were found to be high, and consistent with the values measured in animal skins (16.0{+/-}2.9{per thousand}, AIR). The analysed plants have even higher values, with an average of 22.1{+/-}2.2{per thousand}, AIR. The most probable explanation for the markedly elevated {delta}15N values observed in all the materials investigated is localised soil amendment practices. This is corroborated by the consistent nitrogen isotopic signatures across all the examined tissues, with a notable prevalence in plant tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Many neuronal types show a large depolarization baseline offset (DBLO), which is defined as the positive difference between the minimum membrane potential during action potential trains and resting. We used stochastic parameter search in experimentally constrained conductance-based models to show that four key factors together account for high DBLO: Liquid Junction Potential correction, high backpropagating passive charges during the repolarization phase of an action potential, fast potassium delayed rectifier kinetics, and appropriate transient sodium current kinetics. Several plausible mechanisms for DBLO, such as Ohmic depolarization due to current input or low-pass filtering by the membrane, fail to explain the effect, and many published conductance-based models do not correctly manifest high DBLO. Finally, physiological levels of DBLO constrain ion channel levels and kinetics, and are linked to cellular processes such as bistable firing, spikelets, and calcium influx.

Devastating human conditions like cancers, neurological disorders, and infections, hijack PPI networks to initiate disease, and to drive disease progression. Understanding precisely how diseases remodel PPI networks can, therefore, help clarify disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets. Protein kinases control most cellular processes through protein phosphorylation. The 518 human kinases, known as the kinome, are frequently dysregulated in disease and highly druggable with ATP-competitive inhibitors. Kinase activity, localization, and substrate recognition are regulated by dynamic PPI networks composed of scaffolding and adapter proteins, other signaling enzymes like small GTPases and E3 ligases, and phospho-substrates. Accordingly, mapping kinase PPI networks can help determine kinome activation states, and, in turn, cellular activation states; this information can be used for studying kinase-mediated cell signaling, and for prioritizing kinases for drug discovery. Previously, we have developed a high-throughput method for kinome PPI mapping based on mass spectrometry (MS)-based chemoproteomics that we named kinobead competition and correlation analysis (kiCCA). Here, we introduce 2nd generation (gen) kiCCA which utilizes data-independent acquisition (dia) with parallel accumulation serial fragmentation (PASEF) MS and a re-designed CCA algorithm with improved selection criteria and the ability to predict multiple kinase interaction partners of the same proteins.

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Surprisingly, the routes taken by vestibular signals to reach the cortex are still largely uncharted. Here we show that the primary visual cortex (V1) receives real-time head movement signals -- direction, velocity, and acceleration -- from the ipsilateral pulvinar and contralateral visual cortex. The ipsilateral pulvinar provides the main head movement signal, with a bias toward contraversive movements (e.g. clockwise movements in left V1). Conversely, the contralateral visual cortex provides head movement signals during ipsiversive movements. Crucially, head movement variables encoded in V1 are already encoded in the pulvinar, suggesting that those variables are computed subcortically. Thus, the convergence of inter- and intrahemispheric signals endows V1 with a rich representation of the animals head movements.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

We collected whole-brain electroencephalography (EEG) data while participants (N = 20) viewed the stimulus set used by Yargholi & Op de Beeck (2023). To mask object details and increase reliance on shape information, we also presented silhouette versions of the stimuli. Stimuli were presented in 5Hz streams using rapid serial visual presentation, with intact and silhouette stimuli sets were shown in separate streams. Using standard multivariate decoding pipelines and representational similarity analysis, we found that aspect ratio, category, and animacy were represented during visual object processing. The dominant dimension was modulated by stimulus type, demonstrating that the observable dimensions of object space depend on the nature of the stimuli presented. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aspect ratio is represented during object processing, however earlier and more transiently than categorical dimensions, such as animacy. By focusing on underlying temporal dynamics, our results provide clear new insights into the contradicting findings reported in previous work and reveal a more nuanced understanding of how object space evolves over time.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread cis-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDS) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two Drosophila species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the bcd gene--a prominent example of translational buffering--resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Despite much progress, little is known about how genetic architecture varies across the trait continuum and, in particular, if it differs in the tails of complex traits, where disease often occurs. Here, applying a novel approach based on polygenic scores, we reveal striking departures from polygenic architecture across 148 quantitative trait tails, consistent with distinct concentrations of high-impact rare alleles in one or both tails of most of the traits. We demonstrate replication of these results across ancestries, cohorts, repeat measures, and using an orthogonal family-based approach[2]. Furthermore, trait tails with inferred enrichment of rare alleles are associated with more exome study hits, reduced fecundity, advanced paternal age, and lower predictive accuracy of polygenic scores. Finally, we find evidence of ongoing selection consistent with the observed departures in polygenicity and demonstrate, via simulation, that traits under stabilising selection are expected to have tails enriched for rare, large-effect alleles. Overall, our findings suggest that while common variants of small effect likely account for most of the heritability in complex traits[3], rare variants of large effect are often more important in the trait tails, particularly among individuals at highest risk of disease. Our study has implications for rare variant discovery, the utility of polygenic scores, the study of selection in humans, and for the relative importance of common and rare variants to complex traits and diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

This advocates for investigating methods to accelerate motor axon growth. Electrical nerve stimulation and exercise both enhance motor axon regeneration in rodents and patients, but these interventions cannot always be easily implemented. A roadblock to uncover novel therapeutic approaches based on the effects of activity is the lack of understanding of the synaptic drives responsible for activity-mediated facilitation of axon regeneration. We hypothesized that the relevant excitatory inputs facilitating axon regrowth originate in GABA/glycine synapses which become depolarizing after downregulation of the potassium chloride cotransporter 2 in motoneurons following axotomy. To test this, we injected tetanus toxin (TeTx) in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of mice to block the release of GABA/glycine specifically on TA motoneurons. Thereafter, we axotomized all sciatic motoneurons by nerve crush and analyzed the time-courses of muscle reinnervation in TeTx- treated (TA) and untreated (lateral gastrocnemius, LG) motoneurons. Muscle reinnervation was slower in TA motoneurons with blocked GABA/glycine synapses, as measured by recovery of M- responses and anatomical reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions. Post-hoc immunohistochemistry confirmed the removal of the vesicular associated membrane proteins 1 and 2 by TeTx activity, specifically from inhibitory synapses. These proteins are necessary for exocytotic release of neurotransmitters. Therefore, we conclude that GABA/glycine neurotransmission on regenerating motoneurons facilitates axon growth and muscle reinnervation and discuss possible interventions to modulate these inputs on regenerating motoneurons.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Here we show that dietary restriction (DR) suppresses tumor growth by enhancing CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. DR reshapes CD8+ T cell differentiation within the tumor microenvironment (TME), promoting the development of effector T cell subsets while limiting the accumulation of exhausted T (Tex) cells, and synergizes with anti-PD1 immunotherapy to restrict tumor growth. Mechanistically, DR enhances CD8+ T cell metabolic fitness through increased ketone body oxidation (ketolysis), which boosts mitochondrial membrane potential and fuels tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-dependent pathways essential for T cell function. T cells deficient for ketolysis exhibit reduced mitochondrial function, increased exhaustion, and fail to control tumor growth under DR conditions. Our findings reveal a critical role for the immune system in mediating the anti-tumor effects of DR, highlighting nutritional modulation of CD8+ T cell fate in the TME as a critical determinant of anti-tumor immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Here, we present tools that allow rapid manipulation of vimentin IFs in the whole cytoplasm or within specific subcellular regions by inducibly coupling them to microtubule motors, either pharmacologically or using light.

L1s encode two proteins that are translated from bicistronic transcripts. The translation product of ORF1 (ORF1p) has been robustly detected by immunoassays and shotgun mass spectrometry (MS). Yet, more sensitive detection methods would enhance the use of ORF1p as a clinical biomarker. In contrast, until now, no direct evidence of endogenous L1 ORF2 translation to protein (ORF2p) has been shown. Instead, assays for ORF2p have been limited to ectopic L1 ORF over-expression contexts and to indirect detection of endogenous ORF2p enzymatic activity, such as by the sequencing of de novo genomic insertions. Immunoassays for endogenous ORF2p have been problematic, producing apparent false positives due to cross-reactivities, and shotgun MS has not yielded reliable evidence of ORF2p peptides in biological samples.

ResultsHere we present targeted mass spectrometry assays, selected and parallel reaction monitoring (SRM and PRM, respectively) to detect and quantify L1 ORF1p and ORF2p at their endogenous abundances. We were able to quantify ORF1p and ORF2p present in our samples down to a range in the low attomoles. Confident in our ability to affinity enrich ORF2p, we describe an interactome associated with endogenous ORF2-containing macromolecular assemblies.

ConclusionThis is the first assay to demonstrate sensitive and robust quantitation of endogenous ORF2p. The ability to assay ORF2p directly and quantitatively will improve our understanding of the developmental and diseased cell states where L1 expression and its activity naturally occur. The ability to simultaneously assay endogenous L1 ORF1p and ORF2p is an important step forward for L1 analytical biochemistry. Endogenous ORF2p interactomes can now be presented with confidence that ORF2p is among the enriched proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

However, it remains unanswered why this region is recruited for speaking. Speech production involves not only conceptualization and motor planning, but also respiration that provides the airflow necessary for creating sounds. Thus, the role of Broca's area in speech may be shaped by the functionality and the related brain regions associated with lungs. To test this hypothesis, we recruited the patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and required them to speak out words while scanning their brains with functional and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and qMRI). We found that the COPD patients exhibited altered cortical responses during speaking in left inferior prefrontal and other regions, and the cortical sites governing breathing functioned abnormally in this task. In addition, using the qMRI to generate longitudinal relaxation time (T1) maps as an index of brain microstructural changes including dendritic maturation and myelination, we discovered that the patients showed significantly higher T1 values than the control group in Broca's area, suggesting reduced myelination and impaired microstructural integrity. Crucially, the data indicated that more severe dyspnea was associated with less well-developed microstructure in Broca's area and its weaker activation. Our study has demonstrated for the first time that lungs may function to shape Broca's area as the speaking center, and this is consistent with the recent work of a lung-brain axis.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Neurotransmitter release, for example, is usually the role of the axon. There are widespread exceptions to this rule, however, including many mammalian neuronal types that can release neurotransmitter from their dendrites. In the mouse olfactory bulb, closely related subclasses of dopaminergic interneuron differ markedly in their polarity, with one subtype lacking an axon entirely. These axon-bearing and anaxonic dopaminergic subclasses have distinct developmental profiles and sensory responses, but how their fundamental polarity differences translate to functional outputs remains entirely unknown. Here, we provide anatomical evidence for distinct neurotransmitter release strategies among these closely related dopaminergic subtypes: anaxonic cells release from their dendrites, while axon-bearing neurons release exclusively from their intermittently myelinated axon. These structural differences are linked to a clear functional distinction: anaxonic, but not axon-bearing dopaminergic neurons are capable of self-inhibition. Our findings suggest that variations in polarity can produce striking distinctions in neuronal outputs, and that even closely related neuronal subclasses may play entirely separate roles in sensory information processing.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Here, using Mus musculus SPO11, we report a biochemical system that recapitulates all the hallmarks of meiotic DSB formation. We show that SPO11 catalyzes break formation in the absence of any partners and remains covalently attached to the 5' broken strands. We find that target site selection by SPO11 is influenced by the sequence, bendability and topology of the DNA substrate, and provide evidence that SPO11 can reseal single-strand DNA breaks. In addition, we show that SPO11 is monomeric in solution and that cleavage requires dimerization to reconstitute two hybrid active sites. SPO11 and its partner TOP6BL form a 1:1 complex that catalyzes DNA cleavage with a similar activity to SPO11 alone. However, the complex binds DNA ends with higher affinity, suggesting a potential role post-cleavage. We propose a model where additional partners of SPO11 required for DSB formation in vivo assemble biomolecular condensates that recruit SPO11-TOP6BL, enabling dimerization and cleavage. Our work establishes SPO11 dimerization as the fundamental mechanism that controls the induction of meiotic DSBs.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

PIP can routinely account for up to 40% of all quantitative results, with that proportion rising as high as 75% in single-cell proteomics. Therefore, a significant concern for any PIP method is the possibility of false discoveries: errors that result in peptides being quantified incorrectly. Although several tools for label-free quantification (LFQ) claim to control the false discovery rate (FDR) of PIP, these claims cannot be validated as there is currently no accepted method to assess the accuracy of the stated FDR. We present a method for FDR control of PIP, called ""PIP-ECHO"" (PIP Error Control via Hybrid cOmpetition) and devise a rigorous protocol for evaluating FDR control of any PIP method. Using three different datasets, we evaluate PIP-ECHO alongside the PIP procedures implemented by FlashLFQ, IonQuant, and MaxQuant. These analyses show that PIP-ECHO can accurately control the FDR of PIP at 1% across multiple datasets. Only PIP-ECHO was able to control the FDR in data with injected sample size equivalent to a single-cell dataset. The three other methods fail to control the FDR at 1%, yielding false discovery proportions ranging from 2-6%. We demonstrate the practical implications of this work by performing differential expression analyses on spike-in datasets, where different known amounts of yeast or E. coli peptides are added to a constant background of HeLa cell lysate peptides. In this setting, PIP-ECHO increases both the accuracy and sensitivity of differential expression analysis: our implementation of PIP-ECHO within FlashLFQ enables the detection of 53% more differentially abundant proteins than MaxQuant and 146% more than IonQuant in the spike-in dataset.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

While there are currently three FDA-approved medications for treating AUDs, none specifically target the withdrawal/negative affect stage of AUD, underscoring the need to understand the underlying neurobiology during this critical stage of the addiction cycle. One key region involved in alcohol withdrawal and negative affect is the prelimbic cortex, a subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex. While previous studies have examined alcohol-related adaptations in prefrontal cortical principal glutamatergic neurons, here we used male and female PV:Ai14, SOM:Ai14 and VIP:Ai14 mice to examine synaptic adaptations in all three major classes of prelimbic cortex interneurons following 72 hour withdrawal from a continuous access to two bottle choice model of EtOH drinking in male and female mice. We found that alcohol withdrawal increased excitability of prelimbic PV interneurons in males, but decreased excitability in prelimbic VIP interneurons in females. Additionally, alcohol withdrawal reduced GABA release onto PV interneurons in males while increasing glutamate release onto VIP interneurons in females. In SOM interneurons, alcohol withdrawal had no effect on excitability, but decreased glutamate release onto SOM interneurons in males. Together, our studies identified sex-specific alcohol withdrawal-induced synaptic plasticity in three different types of interneurons and could provide insight into the cellular substrates of negative affective states associated with alcohol withdrawal.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Although the ability of Stentor to habituate has been extensively documented, the mechanism of learning is currently not known. Here we take a bottom-up approach and investigate a simple biochemistry-based model based on prior electrophysiological measurements in Stentor along with general properties of receptor molecules. In this model, a mechanoreceptor senses the stimulus and leads to channel opening to change membrane potential, with a sufficient change in polarization triggering an action potential that drives contraction. Receptors that are activated can become internalized, after which they can either be degraded or recycled back to the cell surface. This activity-dependent internalization provides a potential means for the cell to learn. Stochastic simulations of this model confirm that it is capable of showing habituation similar to what is seen in actual Stentor cells, including the lack of dishabituation by strong stimuli and the apparently step-like response of individual cells during habituation. The model also can account for several habituation hallmarks that a previous two-state Markov model could not, namely, the dependence of habituation rate on stimulus magnitude, which had to be added onto the two state model but arises naturally in the receptor inactivation model; the rate of response recovery after cessation of stimulation; the ability of high frequency stimulus sequences to drive faster habituation that results in a lower response probability, and the potentiation of habituation by repeated rounds of training and recovery. The model makes the prediction that application of high force stimuli that do not normally habituate should drive habituation to weaker stimuli due to decrease in the receptor number, which serves as an internal hidden variable. We confirmed this prediction using two new sets of experiments involving alternation of weak and strong stimuli. Furthermore, the model predicts that training with high force stimuli delays response recovery to low force stimuli, which aligns with our new experimental data. The model also predicts subliminal accumulation, wherein continuation of training even after habituation has reached asymptotic levels should lead to delayed response recovery, which was also confirmed by new experiments. The model is unable to account for the phenomenon of rate sensitivity, in which habituation caused by higher frequency stimuli is more easily reversed leading to a frequency dependence of response recovery. Such rate sensitivity has not been reported in Stentor. Here we carried out a new set of experiments which are consistent with the models prediction of the lack of rate sensitivity. This work demonstrates how a simple model can suggest new ways to probe single-cell learning at an experimental level. Finally, we interpret the model in terms of a kernel estimator that the cell may use to guide its decisions about how to response to new stimuli as they arise based on information, or the lack thereof, from past stimuli.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Typically, animals integrate a variety of allothetic and idiothetic cues to achieve their navigational goals. Allothetic cues, such as visual or chemical landmarks from the environment, provide an external frame of reference. In contrast, idiothetic cues are based on internal proprioceptive feedback and internal copies of motor commands. When Drosophila larvae are exposed briefly to a Teflon container holding a food stimulus, they show a characteristic behavior as soon as the container is removed: They briefly crawl away from the detected resource, remain in its vicinity and then return to the area where they experienced the earlier stimulus. We quantified this behavior with respect to the chemosensory nature of the stimulus, starvation time of the larvae, and agarose concentration of the test plate substrate. We conclude that this behavior represents a centered local search. Furthermore, we exclude various external stimuli (vision and taste), which suggests that possibly idiothetic as opposed to allothetic cues have a stronger influence on the larval local search behavior. In the long term, this behavioral description will enable us to gain insights into the comparability of larval foraging strategies. We also want to investigate whether, despite the simpler organization of the larval brain and the alleged lack of a central complex, a brain region that is important for orientation and navigation in adult Drosophila and other insects, there are common solutions for the brain circuits underlying search behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

It is well-established that TBI-induced neuroinflammation contributes to the long-lasting cognitive deficits and engages brain-resident macrophages (microglia) as well as monocytes-derived macrophages (MDMs) recruited from the periphery. While numerous studies have characterized microglia response to TBI, and the critical role of early infiltrated MDMs in the development of cognitive dysfunctions, the fate of MDMs in TBI remains unknown. Microglia and MDMs have distinct embryological origins and it is unclear if MDMs can fully transition to microglia after infiltrating the brain. This gap in knowledge is due to the fact that after brain engraftment, MDMs stop expressing their signature markers, thus making discrimination from resident microglia cells elusive. Here, for the first time, we longitudinally trace the fate of MDMs by taking advantage of two complementary yet distinct fate mapping mouse lines, CCR2-creERT2 and Ms4a3-cre, where inflammatory monocytes are permanently labeled even after in situ reprogramming. We demonstrated that early infiltrated MDMs persist in the brain for up to 8 months after TBI in adult female and male mice. Notably, MDMs retain their phagocytic activity while remaining transcriptomically distinct from microglia, and show a signature associated with aging and disease. Our data significantly advance the understanding of long-lasting MDMs and provide critical knowledge for developing more targeted therapeutic interventions for myeloid cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Representation learning methods summarize high-dimensional single-cell data into a manageable latent space in a typically nonlinear fashion, allowing cross-sample integration or generative modeling. However, these methods often produce entangled representations, limiting interpretability and downstream analyses. Existing disentanglement methods instead either require supervised information or impose sparsity and linearity, which may not capture the complexity of biological data. We, therefore, introduce Disentangled Representation Variational Inference (DRVI), an unsupervised deep generative model that learns nonlinear, disentangled representations of single-cell omics. This is achieved by combining recently introduced additive decoders with nonlinear pooling, for which we theoretically prove disentanglement under reasonable assumptions. We validate DRVIs disentanglement capabilities across diverse relevant biological problems, from development to perturbational studies and cell atlases, decomposing, for example, the Human Lung Cell Atlas into meaningful, interpretable latent dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that if applied to batch integration, DRVIs integration quality does not suffer from the disentanglement constraints and instead is on par with entangled integration methods. With its disentangled latent space, DRVI is inherently interpretable and facilitates the identification of rare cell types, provides novel insights into cellular heterogeneity beyond traditional cell types, and highlights developmental stages.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Here, across 15 urban areas in Oulu, Finland, we recorded 64 wild Eurasian red squirrels interactions with a novel puzzle box (innovative problem-solving) to obtain a highly preferred food, hazelnuts. We then examined how different levels of human presence nearby, types of activity (walking, dog walking, cycling, and playground activities), and distance to the nearest footpaths influenced squirrels innovative problem-solving ability, measured as solving success at the population level and solving latency at the individual level. At the population level, higher mean human presence nearby significantly decreased the proportion of squirrels that successfully solved the novel food-extraction problem (innovators), and greater human presence nearby decreased first-visit solving latency at individual level. Except for cycling, all types of human activities (walking, dog walking, and playground activity) significantly decreased first-visit success rate. Dog walking and playground activity had a greater negative impact on success rate at the population level than walking. Dog walking was the only outstanding factor affecting first-success latency. We also detected interaction effects between the types of human activities and nearest footpath on overall success rate of all innovators. These results provide evidence for the negative effect of specific human-related factors on squirrels innovative problem-solving abilities.

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

However, the specific mechanisms by which viral proteins influence cholesterol remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces cholesterol sequestration within lysosomes, with the viral protein ORF3a identified as the primary driver of this effect. Mechanistically, we found that ORF3a interacts directly with the HOPS complex subunit VPS39 through a hydrophobic interface formed by residues W193 and Y184. A W193A mutation in ORF3a significantly rescues cholesterol egress and corrects the mislocalization of the lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC2, which is caused by defective trafficking of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) sorting receptor, the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR). We further observed a marked reduction in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), a lipid essential for lysosomal cholesterol egress, in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3a-expressing cells, suggesting BMP reduction as an additional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-caused cholesterol sequestration. Inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol egress using the compound U18666A significantly decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting a potential viral strategy of manipulating lysosomal cholesterol to modulate host cell susceptibility. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a disrupts cellular cholesterol transport by altering lysosomal protein trafficking and BMP levels, providing new insights into virus-host interactions that contribute to lipid dysregulation in infected cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

ResultsWe found similar WMH volume (4112 vs 3144mm3, p=0.2131), smaller hippocampal volume (11856 vs 12227mm3, p=0.0497) and lower cognitive and memory performance, especially the MoCA score (24.9 vs 26.4 pts, p=0.0084), duration completing trail making test B (97.6 vs 79.4 seconds, p=0.0285), Craft immediate recall (12.6 vs 16.4 pts, p<0.0001), Craft delay recall (12.0 vs 15.6 pts, p=0.0001), and Benson figure copy (15.2 vs 16.1 pts, p=0.0078) in 52 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (19[37%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.1[7.4] years) compared with 111 age-matched non-hospitalized participants (66[59%] female; mean[SD] age, 61.5[8.4] years).

Conclusions and RelevanceOur results indicate that hospitalized COVID-19 cases show lower hippocampal volume when compared to non-hospitalized participants. We also show that WMH and hippocampal volumes correlate with worse cognitive scores in hospitalized patients compared with non-hospitalized participants, potentially indicating recent lesions and atrophy.

Key PointsQuestion: Do white matter hyperintensity burden, hippocampal whole and subfield volumes, and cognition differ between patients hospitalized with COVID-19 versus participants without hospitalization?

Findings: We found no significant difference in white matter hyperintensity volume, but hippocampal volume was reduced, and cognitive and memory performance were worse in those hospitalized for COVID-19 compared with age-matched non-hospitalized group (either mild COVID-19 or no COVID-19 reported). In the hospitalized group, increased white matter hyperintensity and reduced hippocampal volumes are significantly higher correlated with worse cognitive and memory scores.

Meaning: Adults hospitalized for COVID-19 had lower hippocampal volumes and worse cognitive performance than adults with COVID-19 that did not lead to hospitalization or without reported COVID-19 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1732399746625

While highly effective in tumors with high mutational burden, lowly mutated cancers, including pediatric malignancies, present low response rate and limited predictive biomarkers. Here, we present a framework for the identification and validation of tumor-reactive T cells as a biomarker to quantify ICI efficacy and as candidates for a personalized TCR-T cell therapy. Therefore, we profiled a pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumor patient with complete remission after ICI therapy using deep single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the peripheral blood. Specifically, we tracked T cell dynamics longitudinally from the tumor to cells in circulating over a time course of 12 months, revealing a systemic response and durable clonal expansion of tumor-resident and ICI-induced TCR clonotypes. We functionally validated tumor reactivity of TCRs identified from the TME and the blood by co-culturing patient-derived tumor cells with TCR-engineered autologous T cells. Here, we observed unexpectedly high frequencies of tumor-reactive TCR clonotypes in the TME and confirmed T cell dynamics in the blood post-ICI to predict tumor-reactivity. These findings strongly support spatio-temporal tracking of T cell activity in response to ICI to inform therapy efficacy and to serve as a source of tumor-reactive TCRs for personalized TCR-T designs.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Our aim was to examine skeletal muscle proteome response to 10-week resistance training (RT1) followed by 10-week training cessation (i.e. detraining, DT), and finally 10-week retraining (RT2). Thirty healthy, untrained participants conducted either periodic RT (RT1-DT-RT2, n=17) or a 10-week no-training control period (n=13) followed by 20 weeks of RT (n=11). RT included twice-weekly supervised whole-body RT sessions, and resting vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained for proteomics analysis using high-end DIA-PASEFs mass spectrometry. First RT period altered 150 proteins (93% increased) involved in e.g. energy metabolism, cytokine signalling, and protein processing compared with minor changes during the no-training control period. The proteome adaptations were similar after the second RT compared to baseline demonstrating reproducibility in proteome adaptations to RT. Many of the proteins were reversed towards baseline after detraining and increased again after retraining. These reversible proteins were especially involved in aerobic energy metabolism. Interestingly, several proteins remain elevated after detraining, including carbonyl reductase 1, histone H1.5, and many calcium-binding proteins. Specifically, Calpain 2 (CAPN2), a calcium-activated protease was recently identified as an epigenetic muscle memory gene. We show for the first time that human skeletal muscle experiences retained levels of several proteins even into detraining. This shows that resistance training evokes long-term protein changes in skeletal muscle and is the first study to demonstrate a proteomic memory of muscle growth following resistance training in human skeletal muscle.

The reconstructed patterns of clonal variation uncovered gene programs driving dynamic positional biasing of clonal composition during axial skeletogenesis and peripheral neurogenesis.

Multiple cave-dwelling populations of the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, have converged on sleep loss compared to river dwelling surface fish. However, the extent to which sleep has been lost across cave populations, and whether sleep loss occurs in wild fish, is poorly understood. We have measured sleep and locomotor activity in 15 distinct populations of A. mexicanus representing multiple lineages that are broadly representative of the 34 cavefish populations identified to date. Strikingly, sleep was largely lost in all cave and hybrid populations that were tested. Hybrid populations retained intermediate eye and pigmentation phenotypes, suggesting sleep loss precedes cave-associated morphological changes. Mapping behavioral changes onto the phylogeny of A. mexicanus populations revealed that independent loss of sleep and elevated locomotor activity has occurred at least three times. Analysis of sleep in the wild confirms that the sleep loss phenotype observed in lab-reared fish is also present in the natural environment. Together, these findings reveal deep evolutionary convergence on sleep loss in cavefish and provide evidence for sleep loss as a primary trait contributing to cave adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

The presence of spectrally broad ( white) light is therefore the exclusive remit of the visual foreground. However, if and how aquatic visual systems exploit this  white effect as an inductive bias, for example to judge distance, remains unknown.

By combining two-photon imaging with hyperspectral stimulation, genetic cone-type ablation, and behaviour, we here show that zebrafish suppress neural responses to the visual background by contrasting  greyscale and  colour circuits that emerge at the first synapse of vision. To do so, zebrafish use an early retinal architecture that fundamentally differs from that of mammals: Rather than combining cone signals to drive the retinal output leading to behaviour, zebrafish vision is built around competing ancestral cone systems: Red/UV versus green/blue. Of these, the non-opponent red and UV cones, which are retained in mammals, are necessary and sufficient for vision. By contrast, the colour opponent green and blue cones, which are lost in mammals, form a net-suppressive  auxiliary system that shape the  core drive from red and UV cones.

Our insights challenge the long-held notions that cones act in concert to drive visual behaviour, and that their spectral diversity primarily serves colour vision. Instead, we posit that vertebrate vision is ancestrally built upon opposing cone systems that emerged to exploit the strong spectral interactions of light with water. This alternative view points at terrestrialisation, not nocturnalisation, as the leading driver for visual circuit reorganisation in mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Endothelial cells (ECs) of the BBB are enwrapped by mural cells including pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) that regulate angiogenesis, vessel stability and barrier function. To explore mural cell control of the BBB, we investigated neurovascular phenotypes in zebrafish pdgfrb mutants that lack brain pericytes and vSMCs. As expected, mutants showed an altered cerebrovascular network with mis-patterned capillaries. Unexpectedly, mutants displayed no BBB leakage from larval through to young adult stages. This demonstrates that pericytes and vSMCs do not control BBB function in young zebrafish. Instead, we observed adult BBB disruption occurring at ""hotspot"" focal haemorrhages at major vessel aneurysms. ECs at leakage hotspots showed induction of caveolae on abluminal surfaces and major structural defects including basement membrane thickening and disruption. Our work suggests that capillary pericytes regulate cerebrovascular patterning in development and vSMCs of major arteries protect from haemorrhage and BBB breakdown in older zebrafish. The fact that young zebrafish can have a conserved BBB with intact barrier function in the absence of mural cells, warrants renewed interrogation of the paradigm of mural cell control of the BBB.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features.

Despite considerable progress in physics-based methods for peptide design and deep-learning methods for protein design, there are currently no robust approaches for de novo design of protein-binding macrocycles. Here, we introduce RFpeptides, a denoising diffusion-based pipeline for designing macrocyclic peptide binders against protein targets of interest. We test 20 or fewer designed macrocycles against each of four diverse proteins and obtain medium to high-affinity binders against all selected targets. Designs against MCL1 and MDM2 demonstrate KD between 1-10 M, and the best anti-GABARAP macrocycle binds with a KD of 6 nM and a sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. For one of the targets, RbtA, we obtain a high-affinity binder with KD < 10 nM despite starting from the target sequence alone due to the lack of an experimentally determined target structure. X-ray structures determined for macrocycle-bound MCL1, GABARAP, and RbtA complexes match very closely with the computational design models, with three out of the four structures demonstrating Ca RMSD of less than 1.5 [A] to the design models. In contrast to library screening approaches for which determining binding mode can be a major bottleneck, the binding modes of RFpeptides-generated macrocycles are known by design, which should greatly facilitate downstream optimization. RFpeptides thus provides a powerful framework for rapid and custom design of macrocyclic peptides for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

The TADPOLE challenge only utilized the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset.

The viruss ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding.

These data demonstrate that H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection in lactating dams leads to mastitis-related disease and transmits to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the neonates.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures4-7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age.

We developed  tissue clocks--predictors of biological age based on tissue images--which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts.

This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration.

Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred.

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology.

This longevity discrepancy also extends to health and aging-larger dogs show higher rates of age-related diseases. Despite this well-established phenomenon, we still know little about the biomarkers and molecular mechanisms that might underlie breed differences in aging and survival. To address this gap, we generated an epigenetic clock using DNA methylation from over 3 million CpG sites in a deeply phenotyped cohort of 864 companion dogs from the Dog Aging Project, including some dogs sampled annually for 2-3 years. We found that the largest breed size tends to have epigenomes that are, on average, 0.37 years older per chronological year compared to the smallest breed size. We also found that higher residual epigenetic age was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, with dogs experiencing a 34% higher risk of death for each year increase in residual epigenetic age. These findings not only broaden our understanding of how aging manifests within a diverse species but also highlight the significant role that demographic factors play in modulating the biological mechanisms underlying aging. Additionally, they highlight the utility of DNA methylation as both a biomarker for healthspan-extending interventions, a mortality predictor, and a mechanism for understanding inter-individual variation in aging in dogs.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., [~]0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE).

We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues. We harness DeepMet to discover several dozen structurally diverse mammalian metabolites. Our work demonstrates the potential for language models to accelerate the mapping of the metabolome.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

This method combines enzymatic in situ polyadenylation of both bacterial and host RNA with spatial RNA-sequencing. Application of this method in a mouse model of intestinal neoplasia revealed the biogeography of the mouse gut microbiome as function of location in the intestine, frequent strong inter-microbial interactions at short length scales, shaping of local microbiome niches by the host, and tumor-associated changes in the architecture of the host-microbiome interface. This method is compatible with broadly available commercial platforms for spatial RNA-sequencing, and can therefore be readily adopted to broadly study the role of short-range, bidirectional host-microbe interactions in microbiome health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

This includes the recent circulation of H5N1 in dairy cattle herds in the USA and a rise in associated human cases. In this study, we investigated differences in tissue tropism of two HPAI H5N1 strains, the isolate A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN1203) isolated from a fatal human case in 2004 and the bovine isolate A/Bovine/Ohio/B24osu-342/2024 (Bov342) isolated in 2024, in C57BL/6J mice. Infection with either HPAI H5N1 isolate was uniformly lethal in mice. However, tissue tropism differed significantly: while VN1203 replication was largely restricted to the respiratory tract, Bov342 successfully replicated in the respiratory tract as well as various regions of the brain. Bov342-challenged animals exhibited clinical signs consistent with central nervous system (CNS) infection, and infectious virus was detected in brain tissue. Correspondingly, cytokine profiles in the brain differed significantly between the isolates. Notably, in addition to abundant evidence of CNS infection in Bov342-challenged mice via immunohistochemistry, sporadic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity was observed in other tissues in the head, including the choroid plexus, retina, and inner ear. This study demonstrates that while both HPAI H5N1 isolates are uniformly lethal in C57BL/6J mice upon aerosol exposure, significant differences exist in tissue tropism, with Bov342 resulting in respiratory disease as well as increased neurotropism and inflammation in the brain and nasal turbinates compared to VN1203, which predominantly induces respiratory disease.

Significance statementThe rise in HPAI H5N1 infections among mammals, including humans in the USA, highlights an emerging One Health concern. Understanding the phenotypic changes of HPAI H5N1 and associated increase in infection of mammalian hosts is critical. In this study, we investigated the tissue tropism in mice of a bovine HPAI H5N1 strain isolated in 2024 and compared it to a strain isolated from a human patient in 2004. Our findings reveal that the bovine isolate exhibits enhanced neurotropism, unlike the respiratory-restricted replication observed with the HPAI H5N1 isolate from 2004. This difference in tissue tropism, accompanied by distinct cytokine responses in the brain, underscores the potential for altered disease outcomes in other mammalian hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

In particular, plague has been linked to population declines in Late Neolithic Europe3,4. Although plague is amongst the most devastating diseases in human history, early strains of Yersinia pestis, the causal agent of plague, lack virulence factors required for the bubonic form5, and their severity remains unclear. Here, we describe the oldest strains of plague reported so far, associated with two early phases of outbreaks among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in the Lake Baikal region in East Siberia, beginning from [~]5600-5400 years ago (cal. BP). These outbreaks occur across four hunter-gatherer cemeteries; the largest of these (Ust-Ida I) has a 38.7% detection rate for plague infection (39% detection across all sites). By reconstructing kinship pedigrees, we show that small familial groups are affected, consistent with human-to-human spread of the disease, and the first outbreak occurred within a single generation. Intriguingly, the infections appear to have resulted in acute mortality events, especially among children. Zoonotic transmission is separately indicated by a Brucella infection in one of the children. Interestingly, we see differences in functional genomic variants in the prehistoric plague strains, including in the ypm superantigen known from Y. pseudotuberculosis today. The new strains diverge ancestrally to all known Y. pestis diversity and push back the Y. pestis divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis by some 2000 years6. Our results show that plague outbreaks happen earlier than previously thought and that these early outbreaks were indeed lethal. The findings challenge the common notion that high population densities and lifestyle changes during the Neolithic transition were prerequisites for plague epidemics.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Our integration study unexpectedly reveals two distinct apCAF lineages present in most cancer types: one associated with mesothelial-like cells and the other with fibrocytes. Using a high-resolution single-cell spatial imaging platform, we characterize the spatial niches of these apCAF lineages. We find that mesothelial-like apCAFs are located near cancer cells, while fibrocyte-like apCAFs are associated with tertiary lymphoid structures. Additionally, we discover that both apCAF lineages can up-regulate the secreted protein SPP1, which facilitates primary tumor formation and peritoneal metastasis. Taken together, this study offers an unprecedented resolution in analyzing apCAF lineages and their spatial niches.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Comprehensive studies are needed to assess its transmission dynamics and clinical presentation.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective observational cohort study at Kamituga General Hospital in South Kivu, DRC, between May 2 and October 9, 2024. Sociodemographic, exposure and clinical data were collected from mpox suspected cases. Cases confirmed by Xpert(R) Mpox PCR were presumed Clade Ib infections (awaiting Clade confirmation) and followed through hospitalization and on days 29 and 59 post-diagnosis to assess clinical progression and outcomes.

FindingsOf 511 included suspected cases, 431 (84%) tested PCR positive; with 205 being women (47%). Age distribution was bimodal, with 279 (65%) individuals aged 15-34 years, and 63 (15%) children under five. Most cases (59%) reported contact with a suspected or confirmed mpox case; among adults, this was primarily a spouse, colleague or sexual partner, while for children, the primary contacts were parents or siblings. Comorbidities were rare (4%), including six (1%) HIV infections. Prodromal symptoms were present in 346 (88%) patients, active skin lesions in 414 (96%), mucosal lesions in 338 (82%), and lymphadenopathy in 295 (71%). In adults, lesions were more concentrated in the genital area, with 90% of adults presenting lesions in this region. In contrast, only 39% of children had genital lesions, with lesions more frequently found elsewhere on the body. Among 427 hospitalized patients, two deaths (0{middle dot}5%) occurred. Among 315 patients with detailed hospital follow-up, complications were primarily genito-urinary (55%) or cutaneous (40%). Four of six pregnant women with recorded outcome (67%) had adverse pregnancy outcomes. Significant sequelae at days 29 and 59 were rare.

InterpretationClade Ib MPXV infections presented differently from previously reported Clade Ia and Clade IIb infections. In adults, the disease primarily affected the genito-urinary system, compatible with sexual transmission, while children mostly manifested extragenital lesions.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes relevant to many physiological and pathological processes. As with all members of the steroid receptor family, GR forms condensates of unknown function. Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggests an involvement of GR condensates in transcription initiation and elongation.

We identified potential pathways contributing to the occurrence and tolerance of CIN. These findings were further validated using single cell multiome data from human placentas, where we observed a high prevalence of heterogeneous aneuploidy across trophoblast cells. Despite extensive chromosomal abnormalities, TSCs maintained their proliferative and differentiation capacities, suggesting that CIN is a typical aspect of placental development.

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Known CRBN neosubstrates share a generalizable {beta}-hairpin G-loop recognition motif, yet systematic exploration of the CRBN target landscape is still pending. Through computational mining of the human proteome using structure-based approaches, we predict over 1,400 CRBN-compatible {beta}-hairpin G-loop proteins across diverse target classes, identify novel mechanisms of neosubstrate recognition through structurally differentiated helical motifs and molecular surface mimicry, and validate 22 representative neosubstrates with clinical implications. This work broadens the CRBN target space, redefines rules for neosubstrate recognition and establishes a platform for the elimination of challenging drug targets by repurposing CRL4CRBN through next-generation molecular glue degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1732399746625
