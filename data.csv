We measured COVID-19 VE against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection in HCWs in the country of Georgia from January - June 2022, during a period of Omicron circulation.

MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of HCWs in six hospitals in Georgia. HCWs were enrolled in early 2021. Participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires. Symptomatic HCWs were tested by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen test (RAT). Participants were also routinely tested, at varying frequencies during the study period, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RAT, regardless of symptoms. Serology was collected quarterly throughout the study and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We estimated absolute and relative VE of a first booster dose compared to a primary vaccine series as (1-hazard ratio)*100 using Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsAmong 1253 HCWs, 141 (11%) received a primary vaccine series (PVS) and a first booster, 855 (68%) received PVS only, and 248 (20%) were unvaccinated. Most boosters were BNT162b2 (Comirnaty original monovalent) vaccine (90%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm) (9%). Most PVS were BNT162b2 vaccine (68%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (24%). Absolute VE for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56 - 77) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104 - 42) at 30 - 59 days, and - 46% (95% CI -156 - 17) at [&ge;] 60 days. Relative VE of first booster dose compared to PVS was 58% (95% CI 1 - 82) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, 21% (95% CI -33 - 54) at 30 - 59 days, and -9% (95% CI -82 - 34) at [&ge;] 60 days.

ConclusionIn Georgia, first booster dose VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was moderately effective but waned very quickly during Omicron. Increased efforts to vaccinate priority groups in Georgia, such as healthcare workers, prior to periods of anticipated high COVID-19 incidence are essential.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

However, they are threatened by climate change and even face the risk of local or global extinction. The responses of these species to climate change have received little attention. In this study, we examine the effects of climate change on state flowers and insects in the United States by employing correlative species distribution models (SDMs). We select a variety of commonly used SDM algorithms to construct an ensemble forecasting framework aimed at predicting the potential habitats for each species under both historical and future climate scenarios, and how these changes might influence the distributions of state flower and insect species. Our results show that more than half of the state flowers ([~] 66%) and insects ([~] 51%) are predicted to experience a substantial decrease in regions with favorable climates within the states they represent. Conversely, only a small number (Flowers: [~] 2%; Insects: [~] 10%) are projected to see an increase in habitat suitability in the future. Certain states may no longer possess suitable habitats for their state-designated species. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage might be at risk due to reduced habitat suitability and local extinctions driven by climate change. These findings can provide guidance regarding the protection or replacement of state species to preserve cultural heritage.

Significance StatementWe have known for decades that climate change may lead to species local or global extinction. However, the vast majority of such research has focused on species of ecological or economic importance. Only recently have researchers begun to seriously consider the impacts of climate change on our cultural heritage, and that research has mainly focused on tangible cultural assests such as buildings and anthropological sites. Here, we consider the impacts of climate change on species of cultural significance, namely U.S. state flowers and insects. We find that the majority of these species are threatened with local extinction from climate change, and the loss of these species will take with them important aspects of our history and culture.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations. Results: We used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020-2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 114 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 76 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

As the most prominent nuclear condensate in eukaryotes, the nucleolus is a layered multiphase liquid-like structure and the site of ribosome biogenesis. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are transcribed and processed, undergoing multiple maturation steps that ultimately result in formation of the ribosomal small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU). However, how rRNA processing is coupled to the layered nucleolar organization is poorly understood due to a lack of tools to precisely monitor and perturb nucleolar rRNA processing dynamics. Here, we developed two complementary approaches to spatiotemporally map rRNA processing and engineer de novo nucleoli. Using sequencing in parallel with imaging, we found that rRNA processing steps are spatially segregated, with sequential maturation of rRNA required for its outward movement through nucleolar phases. Furthermore, by generating synthetic de novo nucleoli through an engineered rDNA plasmid system in cells, we show that defects in SSU processing can alter the ordering of nucleolar phases, resulting in inside-out nucleoli and preventing rRNA outflux, while LSU precursors are necessary to build the outermost layer of the nucleolus. These findings demonstrate how rRNA is both a scaffold and substrate for the nucleolus, with rRNA acting as a programmable blueprint for the multiphase architecture that facilitates assembly of an essential molecular machine.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Our previous work has detailed the timeline of BBB functional maturation in zebrafish, revealing a conserved mechanism of BBB induction through the suppression of endothelial transcytosis. Yet, as opposed to extensive research on glial-vascular interactions in rodents, such interactions remain largely overlooked in the zebrafish model system. Here, we focus on glial-vascular development in the zebrafish brain, leveraging three glial gene promoters: gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), glast (an astrocyte-specific glutamate transporter), and glastini (a new, shortened, equally effective version of the Glast promoter). Using these glial promoters, sparse labeling revealed fewer glial-vascular interactions during early larval stages, with both glial coverage and contact area increasing as the zebrafish brain matured. We then generated stable transgenic lines for both the Glast and Glastini promoters and observed similar increases in glial coverage during larval development, starting at ~30% coverage at 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and peaking at ~60% at 10 dpf. Ultrastructural assessment of glial-vascular interactions using electron microscopy (EM) confirmed a progressive increase in glial coverage over larval development, with maximal coverage reaching ~70% in adult zebrafish, significantly lower than the nearly 100% coverage observed in mammals. Finally, immunogold-EM labeling confirmed that cells identified as glia in aforementioned morphological analyses were indeed Glast-positive. Taken together, our results identify the temporal profile of glial-vascular maturation in the zebrafish brain.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

To interrogate this risk, we developed a two-color flow cytometry-based system (Flo-LOH), detecting LOH in ~5% of cells following a DSB. After this initial increase, cells with LOH decrease due to a competitive disadvantage with parental cells, but if isolated, they stably propagate. Segmental loss from terminal deletions with de novo telomere addition and nonreciprocal translocations is observed as well as whole chromosome loss, especially following a centromeric DSB. LOH spans megabases distal from the DSB, but also frequently tens of megabases centromere-proximal. Inhibition of microhomology-mediated end joining massively increases LOH, which is synergistically increased with concomitant inhibition of canonical nonhomologous end joining. The capacity for large-scale LOH must therefore be considered when using DSB-based gene editing, especially in conjunction with end joining inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

While rational design strategies can expedite the discovery of heterobifunctional CIPs, molecular glues have predominantly been discovered by serendipity. Envisioning a prospective approach to discover molecular glues for a pre-selected target, we hypothesized that pre-existing ligands could be systematically decorated with chemical modifications to discover protein-ligand surfaces that are tuned to cooperatively engage another protein interface. Using high-throughput chemical synthesis to diversify a ligand for the transcriptional coactivator ENL with 3,163 structurally diverse chemical building blocks, we discovered a compound dHTC1 that elicits potent, selective, and stereochemistry-dependent degradation of ENL by induced binding to CRL4CRBN. Unlike prior CRBN-based degraders, dHTC1 binds the ligase with high affinity only after forming the ENL:dHTC1 complex, relying on a hybrid interface of protein-protein and protein-ligand contacts. Altogether, this study points toward an expanded chemical space for co-opting the therapeutically important substrate receptor, CRBN, and a second proof-of-concept extending this approach to BRD4 further validates high-throughput chemistry as a facile tool to discover new degraders.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), possesses a complex cell envelope that determines many of the key physiologic and virulence properties that facilitate infection, which comprises multiple classes of unique lipids. The macrophage phagosome is a key reservoir of infection in pulmonary TB and multiple studies have shown that inorganic phosphate (Pi) is limiting in this environment. The ability of Mtb to sense and respond to phosphate starvation is required for virulence in animal models and replication in human macrophages in vitro. Here, we show that during Pi restriction the Mtb lipidome is markedly remodelled such that phospholipids are replaced with multiple classes of phosphorus-free lipids, some of which have not been documented before. Further, we discover that Mtb can metabolise phospholipid polar heads derived from host pulmonary surfactant as an alternative phosphate source, which sustains cell division for several generations during Pi restriction. These dual manipulations of phospholipid metabolism provide Mtb with an escape from phosphate restriction specific to the infection of alveolar macrophages, one of the earliest steps in establishing pulmonary tuberculosis. The changes in envelope lipidome remodelling, akin to that observed in some marine and terrestrial bacteria suggests that standard Mtb culture conditions that use media with high concentrations of Pi do not reflect the physiologic environment during infection, thereby potentially undermining vaccine and drug development for tuberculosis. Moreover, the distinct Mtb phosphate-free lipids and the metabolic pathways that generate them could provide new antibiotic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Despite their importance, the mechanisms underlying leukocyte and tumor cell extravasation remain incompletely understood. Here, we developed an imaging pipeline that integrates fast, label-free live-cell imaging with deep learning-based image analysis to quantitatively track and compare the initial steps of extravasation--cell landing and arrest on an endothelial monolayer--under physiological flow conditions. We find that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells exhibit variable adhesion strength and flow sensitivity. Remarkably, some PDAC cells demonstrate comparable endothelial engagement as leukocytes, preferentially arresting at endothelial junctions, potentially due to increased stiffness at these sites, which leads to exposure to the underlying basal extracellular matrix. PDAC cells also tend to cluster in regions with high, heterogeneous expression of the endothelial CD44 receptor. Simulations suggest that clustering results from the combination of CD44-mediated attachment and localized flow disturbances that facilitate subsequent cell attachment. Targeting CD44 using siRNA or function-blocking antibodies, or degrading its ligand hyaluronic acid (HA) almost completely abolishes PDAC cell attachment. Overall, we demonstrate that cancer and immune cells share both common and unique features in endothelial adhesion under flow, and identify CD44 and HA as key mediators of PDAC cell arrest.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

While some REDs are population-specific, e.g. Huntington disease-like 2 in Africans, most REDs are represented in all broad genetic ancestries (i.e. Europeans, Africans, Americans, East Asians, and South Asians), challenging the notion that some REDs are found only in specific populations. These results have worldwide implications for local and global health communities in the diagnosis and counselling of REDs.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

They are implicated in multiple neurological disorders including stroke, epilepsy and neurodegeneration and can regulate neuronal excitability through interactions with ion channels2. Polyamines have been linked to pain showing altered levels in human persistent pain states and modulation of pain behaviour in animal models3. However, the systems governing polyamine transport within the nervous system remain unclear. In undertaking a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of chronic pain intensity in the UK-Biobank we found significant association with variants mapping to the SLC45A4 gene locus. In the mouse nervous system SLC45A4 expression is enriched in all sensory neuron sub-types within the dorsal root ganglion including nociceptors. Cell-based assays show that SLC45A4 is a selective plasma membrane polyamine transporter, whilst the cryo-EM structure reveals a novel regulatory domain and basis for polyamine recognition. Mice lacking SLC45A4 show normal mechanosensitivity but reduced sensitivity to noxious heat and algogen induced tonic pain that is associated with reduced excitability of peptidergic nociceptors. Our findings thus establish a role for neuronal polyamine transport in pain perception and identify a new target for therapeutic intervention in pain treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

In a recent benchmarking paper, we observed that existing deep-learning tools show a high true positive rate, but may also produce many false positives when confronted with divergent sequences. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Jaeger, a novel deep-learning method designed specifically for identifying bacteriophage genome fragments. Extensive benchmarking on the IMG/VR database and real-world metagenomes reveals Jaegers consistent high sensitivity (0.87) and precision (0.92). Applying Jaeger to over 16,000 metagenomic assemblies from the MGnify database yielded over five million putative phage contigs.

Plasticity of excitatory projection neurons has been considered to be the primary neuronal substrate for the acquisition and storage of memories. However, a wide range of inhibitory interneurons controls the activity of projection neurons in a spatially and temporally precise manner, yet their contribution to memory acquisition, storage and expression remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a miniature microscope imaging approach to monitor the activity of large amygdala interneuron populations in freely moving mice during fear learning and extinction at the single cell level. We find that amygdala interneurons display mixed-selectivity and show complex plastic responses at both the ensemble and single neuron level across the acquisition, expression and extinction of aversive memories. In contrast to bidirectional single cell plasticity across distinct fear states, learning-induced changes at the population level occur transiently during conditioning and do not consolidate across days. Examining molecular interneuron subpopulations revealed that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing cells are predominantly activated by high fear states. In contrast, somatostatin (SST) interneurons display a preference for safety cues and thereby suppress excitatory neuron responsiveness. However, responses of individual neurons within the SST and VIP populations are non-uniform, indicating the presence of functional subtypes within classical molecularly-defined interneuron populations. Taken together, we identify complex neuronal plasticity within amygdala interneuron ensembles that goes beyond a passive processing function, suggesting a critical role of inhibitory microcircuit elements for memory selectivity and stability.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

To counteract metal-based host defense strategies (e.g., nutritional immunity, metal poisoning), S. aureus uses a combination of metal-sensing transcription factors and regulatory RNAs to maintain metal homeostasis. In this study, we uncovered an unprecedented interaction between a cis- and a trans-acting regulatory RNA controlling a conditionally essential gene, mntY, encoding a Mn efflux pump. This broadly conserved RNA-RNA interaction between a Fe-responsive sRNA and a Mn-sensing riboswitch allows the integration of Fe- and Mn-related stresses, notably encountered at the infection site, to fine-tune mntY expression. Remarkably, deletion of the mntY gene is strongly pleomorphic, causing growth defects, altering virulence factor expression, immune evasion, and survival during infection. We demonstrated that MntY is critical for the adaptation of S. aureus to both low and high Mn environments, due to its dual role in metalation of Mn-dependent exoenzymes and Mn detoxification. These findings point to MntY as a promising new therapeutic target to combat multidrug-resistant staphylococcal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

A common procedure that allows such physical interfacing is cranial microsurgery, wherein small to large craniotomies are performed in the overlying skull for insertion of neural interfaces or implantation of optically clear windows for long-term cranial observation. Performing craniotomies is, however, a skilled task that requires significant time and practice and further needs to be carried out precisely to ensure that the procedure does not cause damage to the underlying brain and dura. Here, we present a computer vision-guided craniotomy robot (CV-Craniobot) that utilizes machine learning to accurately estimate the dorsal skull anatomy from optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Instantaneous information of the skull morphology is used by a robotic mill to rapidly and precisely remove the skull from a desired craniotomy location. We show that the CV-Craniobot can perform small (2 - 4 mm diameter) craniotomies with near 100% success rates within 2 minutes and large craniotomies encompassing most of the dorsal cortex in less than 5 minutes. Thus, the CV-Craniobot enables rapid and precise craniotomies, significantly reducing surgery time as compared to human practitioners and eliminating the need for long training.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

There is considerable evidence supporting the role of immune surveillance in cancer. Whether immunosurveillance imposes a negative selective pressure on pre-cancerous clones, however, is not well established. Here, we studied the association between MHC-variant binding and risk of clonal haematopoiesis (CH), a pre-cancer state in the blood driven by expansions of mutant haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We predicted MHC binding affinity towards 40 known CH hotspot variants in 380,000 UK Biobank participants, and examined the relationship between predicted binding to each variant and risk of its expansion in the blood. Despite being well powered to detect subtle differences in selective pressure, we did not find associations between predicted MHC binding and CH prevalence for any of the hotspot variants. In individuals in whom we identified CH, there was no relationship between predicted binding affinity to the variant and size of the clone. Overall, we do not find evidence for the MHC genotype to be a factor that affects which somatic variants expand in CH, suggesting a limited role for immunosurveillance in shaping the genetic diversity of the blood.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

We further show that their representation in the IPN of both these stimuli is topographically arranged in a way that aligns itself with the representation of the heading signal in this region. We use neuronal ablations to show that the landmark responses, but not the whole field motion responses, require intact habenula input to the IPN.

While S. cerevisiae isolates from the Neotropics are known for their high levels of introgression, the evolutionary events leading to the unusually high prevalence of them remain unclear. Here, we sequenced 216 S. cerevisiae isolates living in open agave fermentation across Mexico, a habitat at the interface of natural and industrial environments. The genomes of these strains revealed considerable genetic diversity and population structure linked to geographic distribution, which had been overlooked due to undersampling of this megadiverse region. These strains, along with those from French Guiana, Ecuador, and Brazil, form a broader Neotropical phylogenetic cluster that is notably enriched with introgressions. Surprisingly, the origins and conservation patterns of introgressions indicate multiple hybridization events, suggesting an unprecedented scenario of flexible species barriers in this region.

Here, we investigate how extracellular pH changes with age and its impact on longevity, using fly and mouse models. We find that extracellular acidification occurs in flies during aging and correlates to mortality rate. With age, flies also become more susceptible to die from acidotic stress, which can be prevented by alkalotic treatment. Acidification is caused by insufficient acid elimination, linked to downregulation of genes in the fly excretory tract that control pH and ATP production, essential for active secretion initiation. In mice, we show that lymph-drained interstitial fluids acidify with age. Expression of genes, whose pathogenic loss-of-function variants cause tubular acidosis in humans, is decreased in the kidneys of aging mice. Overall, this study sheds light on dysregulated systemic acid-base balance as a conserved pathophysiological mechanism of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

These biosensors can be deployed in engineered cells to study or treat disease. Although the central mediators of hypoxia responsiveness have been characterized, the dynamics of this response are generally less understood, and there is no general approach to modulate hypoxia biosensors to tune their performance to meet application-specific needs. To address the need for high-performing hypoxia biosensors, we investigated strategies to enhance biosensor performance by identifying minimal promoter choices and positive feedback circuits that both achieved low background and amplified hypoxia-induced gene expression. To generate insight into the mechanisms by which feedback drives differential performance, we developed an explanatory mathematical model. Our analysis suggests a previously unreported dual regulatory mechanism that was necessary to explain the full set of experimental observations and that provides new insights into regulatory dynamics in chronic hypoxia. This study exemplifies the potential of using synthetic gene circuits to perturb natural systems in a manner that uniquely enables the elucidation of novel facets of natural regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Herein, we demonstrate a significant change in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) dependent entry by primary SARS-CoV-2 isolates that occurred upon arrival of Omicron lineages. Mechanistically we show this shift to be a function of two distinct ACE2 pools based on TMPRS22 association with the ACE2 Collectrin-Like Domain (CLD). In engineered cells overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, ACE2/TMPRSS2 complexes led to either augmentation or attenuation of viral infectivity of pre-Omicron and Omicron lineages, respectively. Mutagenesis of the ACE2-CLD TMPRSS2 cleavage site in ACE2 restored infectivity across all Omicron lineages through enabling ACE2 binding that facilitated TMPRSS2 activation of viral fusion. Our data supports the evolution of Omicron lineages towards the use of ACE2 unable to form complexes with TMPRSS2 and consistent with ACE2 structure and function as a chaperone for many tissue specific amino acid transport proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Longer-lived mammals tend to gain fewer noisy CpGs with age, irrespective of whether these originate from hyper- or hypomethylation processes.

To evaluate existing models of neurocognitive ageing such as compensation, maintenance, or reserve, we explore how various known brain-based and cardiorespiratory fitness factors intersect to better understand cognitive decline. We tested 73 (Mage = 65.51) neurologically healthy older adults and collected neuroimaging (functional, structural, and perfusion MRI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and behavioural performance data to investigate a well-documented, prominent cognitive challenge for older adults: word-finding failures. We aimed to uncover associations between predictors, which have previously been theoretically-implicated, in explaining age-related tip-of-the-tongue rates. Commonality analyses revealed that functional activation of language networks associated with tip-of-the-tongue states is in part linked with age and, interestingly, cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Age-associated atrophy and perfusion in regions other than those showing functional differences accounted for variance in tip-of-the-tongue states. Our findings can be interpreted in the context of the classic models of neurocognitive ageing suggesting compensation.

While traditionally viewed as a mutagenic selfish element, recent studies point to roles for LINE1 in early mouse development, T cell quiescence and neurogenesis. Here we show that human LINE1 RNA is essential for self-renewal and identity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Silencing of LINE1 using either antisense oligonucleotides or CRISPR interference in naive hESCs leads to a strong induction of 8C-like cells (8CLCs). We found that genes derepressed upon LINE1 KD are not uniformly distributed across the genome, with an enrichment for chromosome 19, which includes key markers of the 8C state such as TPRX1. Silencing of TPRX1, but not other putative 8C regulators p53 or H3.XY, suppresses the induction of the 8C program in LINE1 KD hESCs. We found that LINE1 RNA is preferentially localized to the lamina and periphery of the nucleolus in hESCs. Sequencing of Lamina-Associated Domains (LADs) and Nucleolus-Associated Domains (NADs) reveals a preferential association of chromosome 19 with NADs in hESCs. However, 8CLCs have a distinct nucleolar morphology and a lower association of chromosome 19 and TPRX1 loci with the nucleolus relative to naive and primed hESCs, suggesting a role for nucleolar dynamics in the 8CLC-hESC transition. In agreement, LINE1 KD leads to disruption of nucleolar architecture with signs of nucleolar stress. Independent perturbations of the nucleolus induce the 8C program in hESCs. Genes induced by LINE1 KD are enriched for targets of Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2), and inhibition of PRC2 leads to a strong induction of 8C genes. Our results indicate that LINE1 coordinates nuclear compartmentalization and chromatin-mediated gene repression to prevent developmental reversion of hESCs.

Representation is multisensory, relying on both visual and proprioceptive cues. When these cues conflict, the brain recalibrates its unimodal estimates, shifting them closer together to compensate. Converging lines of evidence from research in perception, behavior, and neurophysiology suggest that such updates to body representation must be communicated to the motor system to keep hand movements accurate. We hypothesized that primary somatosensory cortex (S1) plays a crucial role in conveying the proprioceptive aspects of the updated body representation to the motor system. We tested this hypothesis in two experiments. We predicted that proprioceptive, but not visual, recalibration would be associated with change in short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a measure of sensorimotor integration (influence of sensory input on motor output) (Expt. 1). We further predicted that modulating S1 activity with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) should affect variance and recalibration associated with the proprioceptive estimate of hand position, but have no effect on the visual estimate (Expt. 2). Our results are consistent with these predictions, supporting the idea that (1) S1 is indeed a key region in facilitating motor system updates based on changes in body representation, and (2) this function is mediated by unisensory (proprioceptive) processing, upstream of multisensory visuo-proprioceptive computations. Other aspects of the body representation (visual and multisensory) may be conveyed to the motor system via separate pathways, e.g. from posterior parietal regions to motor cortex.

Significance StatementRepresentation of the hand, which is critical for accurate control of movement, comes from weighting and combining available proprioceptive and visual cues. Our results suggest that when the hand representation is modified, the motor system receives updates directly from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). These updates are proprioceptive, having not yet been integrated with visual cues through interaction with high-level posterior parietal regions. This might provide advantages in terms of faster updates, for example, because multisensory integration likely adds processing time. Research seeking to manipulate motor control via multisensory perception (e.g., virtual reality or mirror training for motor rehabilitation) should therefore consider the parallel unisensory and multisensory pathways that affect the motor system.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

It has been demonstrated previously that many such sequences show high similarity to genes from RNA viruses, either due to viral infection of the original sample, contamination or endogenous viral elements (EVEs) integrated into the genome of the sample species. Many proteins from RNA virus discovery research are also deposited into these repositories but, for various reasons, can only be labelled as uncharacterised and classified taxonomically at a superkingdom or realm level. Sequences from protein repositories not labelled specifically as being derived from the RNA viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein are often used as negative controls when looking to identify viral RdRp sequences, so the presence of unlabelled viruses amongst these datasets is problematic.

In this study, we screened uncharacterised proteins from two large public protein repositories - NCBI Protein and UniProt - to identify sequences likely to be derived from RNA viral RdRp. 3,560 such sequences were identified, many derived from EVEs. Many previously unknown EVEs were identified and led to characterisation of additional, related sequences. For example, a group of orbivirus-like viruses infecting nematodes was uncovered which appears to have both ancient endogenous and circulating exogenous members. Many recent integrations of mito-like viruses into plant genomes were identified, indicative of current or recent RNA viral activity. In several taxonomic groups, the first example of an EVE, and in some cases the first example of any RNA virus, was uncovered. The large number of EVEs uncovered by this relatively small-scale search suggests that only a fraction of the true diversity of EVEs is currently known.

We also explore uncharacterised proteins further by providing provisional taxonomic annotations for RdRps which are currently only listed as members of the Riboviria realm. A number of sequences are identified which are indistinguishable from known, pathogenic viruses but are labelled as bacteria, seemingly as a result of mislabelling or contamination. Sequences which are not RNA viral but show some similarity to RdRp are also analysed, as a potential source of false positives in virus discovery research. Finally, recommendations are made for generating useful negative controls.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Reward-prediction errors were reduced and confidence in the outcome prediction increased. Upon rule reversal, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, through disinhibitory VIP interneurons, encoded a context-prediction error, signaling a loss of confidence. The hierarchy of prediction errors in cortical areas is mirrored in top-down signals modulating apical activity in the primary sensory cortex.

Mutations in the tumor-suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 significantly increase the risk of developing cancer, with the probability rising by more than 50%. Identifying pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is crucial for both diagnosis and treatment. Targeted panels, which focus on medically relevant subsets of genes, have become essential tools in precision oncology. Beyond technical and human resource factors, standardized bioinformatics workflows are essential for the accurate interpretation of results. We developed a robust bioinformatics pipeline, implemented with Nextflow, to process sequencing data from targeted panels to identify germline variants.

ResultsWe developed an automated and reproducible pipeline using Nextflow for the targeted sequencing of BRCA1/2 genes. The pipeline incorporates two variant callers, Strelka and DeepVariant, both of which have demonstrated high performance in detecting germline SNVs and indels. The runtime is efficient, with a median execution time of less than 3 minutes per task. We sequenced and processed 16 samples from breast cancer patients. In our analysis, we identified 8 nonsynonymous mutations in BRCA1 and 9 in BRCA2. Of the total reported germline mutations, 97% were classified as benign, 1% as pathogenic, 1% as of uncertain significance, and 1% as unknown. The allelic frequencies observed in our cohort closely resemble those of Admixed American and South Asian populations, with the greatest divergence observed in comparison to African individuals.

ConclusionWe successfully analyzed the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 16 breast cancer patients at a public hospital in Chile. A custom Nextflow pipeline was developed to process the sequencing data and evaluate the pathological significance of the identified genetic variants. By employing multiple variant-calling methodologies, we were able to detect and mitigate potential false positives, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of variant detection through cross-verification. A pathogenic variant was identified in one patient, while benign or likely benign variants were found in the remaining 15. Expanding the number of oncogenes sequenced per patient could improve the detection of actionable variants.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

Upon damage of lysosomal membranes and resulting mATG8 recruitment to their surface by CASM, BLTP3A first dissociates from lysosomes but then reassociates with them via an interaction of its LIR motif with mATG8. Such interaction is mutually exclusive to the binding of BLTP3A to vesicles and leaves its N-terminal chorein domain, i.e. the proposed entry site of lipids into this family of proteins, available for binding to another membrane, possibly the ER.

Disease control relies on prevention (water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions or vaccination) and effective antimicrobial treatment. Antimicrobial resistant (AMR) Typhi lineages have emerged and become established in many parts of the world. Knowledge of local pathogen populations informed by genomic surveillance, including of lineages (defined by the GenoTyphi scheme) and AMR determinants, is increasingly used to inform local treatment guidelines and to inform vaccination strategy. Current tools for genotyping Typhi require multiple read alignment or assembly steps and have not been validated for analysis of data generated with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing devices. Here, we introduce Typhi Mykrobe, a command line software tool for rapid genotyping of Typhi lineages, AMR determinants, and plasmid replicons direct from sequencing reads. Results We validated Typhi Mykrobe lineage genotyping by comparison with the current standard read mapping-based approach and demonstrated 99.8% concordance across nearly 13,000 genomes sequenced with Illumina platforms. For the few isolates with discordant calls, we show that Typhi Mykrobe results are better supported by the evidence from raw sequence read data than the results generated using the mapping-based approach.

Typhi Mykrobe predicts clinical resistance categorisation (S/I/R) for eight drug classes, and we show strong agreement with phenotypic categorisations generated from reference laboratory minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data for n=1,572 Illumina-sequenced isolates (>99% agreement within one doubling dilution). Using n=100 isolates sequenced with both Illumina and ONT, we show strong concordance (>96% for genotype and >98% for AMR and plasmid) between calls made from ONT reads and those made from Illumina reads. Typhi Mykrobe takes less than a minute per sample and is available at https://github.com/typhoidgenomics/genotyphi. Conclusions Typhi Mykrobe provides rapid and sensitive genotyping of Typhi genomes direct from Illumina and ONT reads. It demonstrated accurate assignment of GenoTyphi lineage, detection of AMR determinants and prediction of corresponding AMR phenotypes, and identification of plasmid replicons.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

As G4s modulate gene expression and genomic stability, genome-wide mapping of G4s has generated strong research interest. Recently, the Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) method was performed with the G4-specific BG4 antibody to target Tn5 transposase to G4s. While this method generated a novel high-resolution map of G4s, we unexpectedly observed a strong correlation between the genome-wide signal distribution of BG4 CUT&Tag and accessible chromatin. To examine whether untargeted Tn5 cutting at accessible chromatin contributes to BG4 CUT&Tag signal, we examined the genome-wide distribution of signal from untargeted (i.e. negative control) CUT&Tag datasets. We observed that untargeted CUT&Tag signal distribution was highly similar to both that of accessible chromatin and of BG4 CUT&Tag. We also observed that BG4 CUT&Tag signal increased at mapped G4s, but this increase was accompanied by a concomitant increase in untargeted CUT&Tag at the same loci. Consequently, enrichment of BG4 CUT&Tag over untargeted CUT&Tag was not increased at mapped G4s. These results imply that either the vast majority of accessible chromatin regions contain mappable G4s or that the presence of G4s within accessible chromatin cannot reliably be determined using BG4 CUT&Tag alone.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Computer vision algorithms use depth maps to encode distances in three-dimensional scenes but it is unknown whether such depth maps are generated by animal visual systems. To answer this question, we focused on motion parallax, a depth cue relying on visual motion resulting from movement of the observer. As neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are broadly modulated by locomotion, we hypothesized that they may integrate vision- and locomotion-related signals to estimate depth from motion parallax. Using recordings in a three-dimensional virtual reality environment, we found that conjunctive coding of visual and self-motion speeds gave rise to depth-selective neuronal responses. Depth-selective neurons could be characterized by three-dimensional receptive fields, responding to specific virtual depths and retinotopic locations. Neurons tuned to a broad range of virtual depths were found across all sampled retinotopic locations, showing that motion parallax generates a depth map of visual space in V1.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

While many CBD preparations have been studied in randomized clinical trials involving ASD, none have used purified CBD preparations or preparations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, nor have they focused on low-functioning children with ASD. Previous studies have identified several candidate electrophysiological biomarkers for the cognitive and behavioral disabilities in ASD, with one emerging biomarker being aperiodic neural activity. Here we examined whether periodic (oscillatory) and/or aperiodic electroencephalography (EEG) features are predictive of any symptomatic changes in ASD following pharmacological CBD intervention. To do this, we leveraged resting-state EEG from children with low-functioning ASD (24 boys, aged 7-14 years) using data obtained during a prior double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase III Clinical Trial (NCT04517799) that investigated using cannabidiol to treat severe behavior problems in children with ASD. Using linear mixed effect models, we found that aperiodic EEG signal features varied directly with 7-COOH-CBD metabolite levels in blood, as evidenced by a larger aperiodic offset (p < 0.001) and decreased aperiodic exponent (p < 0.05) across the scalp. Furthermore, 7-COOH-CBD metabolite levels in blood had a positive association with nonverbal intelligence and visuomotor coordination (p < 0.05). Finally, changes in visuomotor coordination attributed to occipital oscillatory EEG activity were mediated by changes in 7-COOH-CBD metabolite levels in blood, with distinct effects observed for the delta frequency band (p < 0.05). Our analytical results suggest that this daily CBD preparation and administration schedule exerted some benefits, with improvements to cognitive and behavioral abilities in a low-functioning ASD children population. Our findings support the inclusion of resting-state, aperiodic signal features as candidate biomarkers for tracking the clinical impact of CBD treatment, in addition to traditional oscillatory EEG measures, within a neurodevelopmental context.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Stabilization of the WNT effector {beta}-catenin promotes expression of mesoderm-specifying genes such as Brachyury (Bra/T, encoded by TBXT) and Eomesodermin and drives an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that occurs at 49-52 hrs post WNT activation. Interestingly, WNT activation also triggers an early contraction of stem cell colonies, with increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, resulting to cellular morphological changes. Small molecule inhibitors and genetic approaches were applied to determine if contractility is related to mesoderm differentiation. Contrary to expectation, suppressing contractility accelerated differentiation; Bra/T induction was enhanced, and EMT initiated as early as 24 hrs post WNT activation. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Rho kinase or myosin light chain kinase, to increase contractility, efficiently blocked any induction of mesoderm, including EMT. Mechanistically, reduced contractility promoted active {beta}-catenin levels in the cytoplasm and nucleus. We propose that the early contraction of human pluripotent stem cell colonies in response to WNT activation initially delays mesoderm induction by restraining accumulation of active {beta}-catenin, suggesting a role for contractility as a temporal gate.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

They vocally advertise and reinforce their pair-bonds by singing complex duets, in which both the male and female perform a predetermined sex-specific set of song phrases, including the loud and elongated great-calls. Only females and sub-adult male gibbons have been previously observed performing great-calls. Once a male gibbon matures, he normally stops great-call production completely but continues singing other and less high-pitched song phrases. This case study describes a fully adult, castrated male lar gibbon (Hylobates lar, 32 years old, zoo-housed) who performs both male phrases of the duet, including the female great-call. The male regularly produced great-calls despite being in a, relatively weak, pair bond with a female conspecific. His great-calls adhered to the general structure of typical female great-calls but were shorter and had a lower maximum frequency. Notably, he produced these great-calls predominantly when the female was absent, especially when she was in their inside enclosure whilst he was outside. Behavioural observations indicate that the occurrence of great-calls by the male cannot be predicted based on pre-song behaviour or his interaction with the female. The recurrence of sub-adult singing behaviour in a fully grown adult is most likely due to his reduced testosterone levels. This study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of duetting and the unique occurrence of cross-sex song production in gibbons, emphasizing the complexity of pair-bond communication in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Explosive growth of targeted protein degradation (TPD) drug development has spurred renewed interest in proximity-inducing molecules and especially Molecular Glue Degraders (MGDs). These compounds catalyze destruction of disease-causing proteins by reshaping protein surfaces and promoting cooperative binding between ubiquitylating enzymes and target proteins. MGD discovery for pre-defined targets is a major challenge in contemporary drug discovery. The field is limited by a lack of approaches that can exploit charged ligand-binding pockets, thus excluding a major fraction of ubiquitin ligases (E3s) that evolved to recognize exceedingly common acidic and basic degrons. Here we solve these important chemical challenges through ""chemocentric"" MGD discovery of ZZ1, a BET-family protein degrader and a prodrug of a negatively charged glue (c-Glue). ZZ1 activation unmasks a sulfinic acid moiety that binds the modular GID/CTLH ubiquitin ligase complex via a basic pocket in its YPEL5 subunit. YPEL5 is a CRBN structural homolog and an essential non-Cullin ubiquitin ligase cofactor expressed in cancers of the bone marrow.

However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in Pst, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve Pst races or isolates, a Puccinia striiformis isolate, and one Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed the presence of known effector motifs such as [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Clear annotations based on sequence and structure included superoxide dismutase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase. A common feature observed was the formation of similar structures from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune function. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between Pst effectors and effectors from other pathogens such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting convergent evolutionary strategies. This comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into Pst effectors structural and functional characterization, advancing our understanding of Pst pathogenicity and evolution.

Author SummaryStripe rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a major threat to wheat crops worldwide. The fungus uses special proteins, called effectors, to bypass the plants immune defenses and establish infection. To better understand how these effectors work, we used a computational tool, AlphaFold2, to predict the structures of over 15,000 Pst effector proteins. Interestingly, some of the effectors resemble proteins found in other plant pathogens, suggesting that different fungi may evolve similar ways to infect plants. Our research offers new insights into the infection strategies of Pst and could lead to new methods for protecting wheat from stripe rust.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Individuals learn category labels using a variety of strategies to ensure that sensory signals, such as sounds or images, can be assigned to proper categories. Categories are often learned on the basis of extreme examples, and the boundary between categories can differ among individuals. The trajectories for learning also differ among individuals, as different individuals rely on different strategies, such as repeating or alternating choices. However, little is understood about the relationship between individual learning trajectories and learned categorization. To study this relationship, we trained mice to categorize auditory stimuli into two categories using a two-alternative forced choice task. Because the mice took several weeks to learn the task, we were able to quantify the time course of individual strategies and how they relate to how mice categorize stimuli around the categorization boundary. Different mice exhibited different trajectories in learning the task. Mice displayed preferences for a specific category, manifested by a choice bias in their responses, but this bias drifted with learning. We found that this drift in choice bias correlated with variability in the category boundary for sounds with ambiguous category membership. Next, we asked how stimulus-independent, individual-specific strategies informed learning. We found that the tendency to repeat choices, which is a form of perseveration, contributed to long-term learning.

Our prior studies highlight the importance of glutamate as a key regulator of ILC tumor growth and therapeutic response. Here we examine the expression of four key proteins involved in glutamate transport and metabolism (SLC3A2, SLC7A11, GPX4, and GLUD1/2) in a racially diverse cohort of 72 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) ILC and 50 ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type (IDC/NST) patients with primary disease. All four proteins are associated with increased tumor size in ILC, but not IDC/NST, with SLC3A2 also specifically linked to shorter overall survival and the presence of comorbidities in ILC. Notably, GLUD1/2 expression is associated with ER expression in ILC, and is most strongly associated with increased tumor size and stage in Black women with ILC from our cohort and TCGA. We further explore the effects of GLUD1 inhibition in endocrine therapy-resistant ILC cells using the small-molecule inhibitor R162, which reduces ER protein levels, increases reactive oxygen species, and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation. These findings highlight a potentially important role for glutamate metabolism in ILC, particularly for Black women, and position several of these glutamate-handling proteins as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ILC.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

How the resultant spatial heterogeneity shapes within-host genetic diversity and viral evolutionary pathways is poorly understood. Here we show that dispersal within and between the nasal cavity and trachea maintains diversity and is therefore conducive to adaptive evolution, whereas dispersal to the lungs is stochastic and gives rise to population heterogeneity. We infected ferrets either intranasally or by aerosol with a barcoded influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus. At 1, 2 or 4 days post infection, dispersal was assessed by collecting 52 samples from throughout the respiratory tract of each animal. Irrespective of inoculation route, barcode compositions across the nasal turbinates and trachea were similar and highly diverse, revealing little constraint on the establishment of infection in the nasal cavity and descent through the trachea. By comparison, infection of the lungs produced genetically distinct viral populations. Lung populations were pauci-clonal, suggesting that each seeded location received relatively few viral genotypes. While aerosol inoculation gave distinct populations at every lung site sampled, within-host dispersal after intranasal inoculation produced larger patches, indicative of local expansion following seeding of the lungs. Throughout the respiratory tract, barcode diversity declined over time, but new diversity was generated through mutation. De novo variants were often unique to a given location, indicating that localized replication following dispersal resulted in population divergence. In summary, dispersal within the respiratory tract operates differently between regions and contributes to the potential for viral evolution to proceed independently in multiple within-host subpopulations.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

In particular, the internally-oriented networks like the default network (DN) and externally-oriented dorsal attention networks (dATNs) are thought to be globally competitive, which implies DN disengagement during cognitive states that drive the dATNs and vice versa. If these networks are globally opposed, how is internal and external information integrated across these networks? Here, using precision neuroimaging methods, we show that these internal/external networks are not as dissociated as traditionally thought. Using densely sampled high-resolution fMRI data, we defined individualized whole-brain networks from participants at rest, and the retinotopic preferences of individual voxels within these networks during an independent visual mapping task. We show that while the overall network activity between the DN and dATN is opponent at rest, a latent retinotopic code structures this global opponency. Specifically, the anti-correlation (i.e., global opponency) between the DN and dATN at rest is structured at the voxel-level by each voxels retinotopic preferences, such that the spontaneous activity of voxels preferring similar visual field locations are more anti-correlated than those that prefer different visual field locations. Further, this retinotopic scaffold integrates with the domain-specific preferences of subregions within these networks, enabling efficient, parallel processing of retinotopic and domain-specific information. Thus, DN and dATN dynamics are opponent, but not competitive: voxel-scale anti-correlation between these networks preserves and encodes information in the negative BOLD responses, even in the absence of visual input or task demands. These findings suggest that retinotopic coding may serve as a fundamental organizing principle for brain-wide communication, providing a new framework for understanding how the brain balances and integrates internal cognition with external perception.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

In particular, high-throughput experiments to measure mutant fitness in microbes are increasingly common but vary widely in their definitions of fitness, which makes their results difficult to compare. What are the consequences of these different fitness statistics, and is there a best way to quantify fitness in a given context? Here we systematize the set of possible fitness statistics according to the following three choices: 1) the encoding of relative abundance (e.g., transforming by a log or logit function), 2) the time scale over which to measure the change in relative abundance, and 3) the choice of a reference subpopulation for calculating fitness in bulk competition experiments, such as those using DNA-barcoded mutants. We show that these different choices can lead to significantly different interpretations of mutant fitness, affecting the magnitude of fitness effects, the presence of epistasis, and even the fitness ranking across mutants. This can confound predictions for evolutionary dynamics and gene functions. Altogether our results demonstrate the importance of consistent fitness definitions for reproducible results across experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

NLRs display diverse sub-cellular localizations, which are associated with the capacity of the immune receptor to confer disease resistance and recognize its corresponding avirulence effector. In wheat, the NLR PM3b recognizes the wheat powdery mildew effector AVRPM3b2/c2 and we examined the molecular mechanism underlying this recognition. We show that PM3b and other PM3 variants localize to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) contact sites (EPCS) while AVRPM3b2/c2 localizes to the nucleocytoplasmic space. Additionally, we found that PM3b interacts in planta with AVRPM3b2/c2 through its LRR domain. We further demonstrate that full length PM3b interaction with AVRPM3b2/c2 is considerably weaker than for the isolated PM3b LRR domain or the susceptible PM3 variant PM3CS, indicating that activation of PM3b leads to dissociation of the complex. In line with this: We observed a strong interaction between PM3b and AVRPM3b2/c2 in a P-loop mutant of PM3b which was unable to initiate a cell death response, or when an inactive variant of AVRPM3b2/c2 was used. We propose that PM3b transiently interacts with AVRPM3b2/c2 through residues in the LRR which are conserved among PM3 variants while the amino acids necessary for full activation and cell death signaling are unique to PM3b. Our data suggests that PM3b localization and interaction with AVRPM3b2/c2 differs from other well studied NLRs and further highlights the mechanistic diversity in NLR-mediated responses against pathogens in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

The Ca<2+/>-activated TMEM16 family of membrane proteins play an important role in collapsing this asymmetric lipid distribution by spontaneously, and bidirectionally, scrambling phospholipids between the two leaflets, which can initiate signaling and alter the physical properties of the membrane. While evidence shows that lipid scrambling occurs via an open hydrophilic pathway (""groove"") that spans the membrane, it remains unclear if all family members facilitate lipid movement in this manner. Here we present a comprehensive computational study of lipid scrambling by all TMEM16 members with experimentally solved structures. We performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 27 structures from five different family members solved under activating and non-activating conditions, and we captured over 700 scrambling events in aggregate. This enabled us to directly compare scrambling rates, mechanisms, and protein-lipid interactions for fungal and mammalian TMEM16s, in both open (Ca<2+/>-bound) and closed (Ca<2+/>-free) conformations with statistical rigor. We show that nearly all (>90%) scrambling occurs in the dilated groove and the degree of induced membrane thinning positively correlates with the scrambling rate. Surprisingly, we also observed 60 scrambling events that occurred outside the canonical groove, over 90% of which took place at the dimer-dimer interface in mammalian TMEM16s.

Traditionally, neuromodulators like dopamine are believed to be released in a diffuse manner and are not commonly associated with synaptic structures where pre- and postsynaptic processes are closely aligned. Our findings challenge this conventional view. Using single-bouton optical measurements of dopamine release, we discovered that dopamine is predominantly released from varicosities that are juxtaposed against the processes of their target neurons. Dopamine axons specifically target neurons expressing dopamine receptors, forming synapses to release dopamine. Interestingly, varicosities that were not directly apposed to dopamine receptor-expressing processes or associated with neurons lacking dopamine receptors did not release dopamine, regardless of their vesicle content. The ultrastructure of dopamine release sites share common features of classical synapses. We further show that the dopamine released at these contact sites induces a precise, dopamine-gated biochemical response in the target processes. Our results indicate that dopamine release sites share key characteristics of conventional synapses that enable relatively precise and efficient neuromodulation of their targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Central to GCE is the development of orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)/tRNA pairs wherein engineered aaRSs recognize chosen ncAAs and charge them onto tRNAs that decode blank codons (e.g., the amber stop codon). Many orthogonal aaRS/tRNA pairs covering a wide range of ncAAs have been generated by directed evolution, yet the evolution of new aaRS/tRNA pairs by standard strategies remains a labor-intensive process that often produces aaRS/tRNA pairs with suboptimal ncAA incorporation efficiencies. In this study, we present a strategy for evolving aaRSs that leverages OrthoRep to drive their continuous hypermutation in yeast. We demonstrate our strategy in 8 independent aaRS evolution campaigns starting from 4 different aaRS/tRNA parents targeting 7 distinct ncAAs. We observed the rapid evolution of multiple novel aaRSs capable of incorporating an overall range of 13 ncAAs tested into proteins in response to the amber codon. Some evolved systems reached efficiencies for amber codon-specified ncAA-dependent translation comparable to translation with natural amino acids specified by sense codons in yeast. Additionally, we discovered a surprising aaRS that evolved to self-regulate its own expression for greater dependency on ncAAs for translation. These findings demonstrate the potential of OrthoRep-driven aaRS evolution platforms in supporting the continued growth of GCE technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Herein, we repurpose a newly identified post-transcriptional interaction between the uxuB leader sequence and the E. coli CsrA regulatory protein to design a biological post-transcriptional BANDPASS filter. In this work, we characterize the uxuB mRNA as heterogenous target of the Carbon Storage Regulatory A (CsrA) protein, where the protein can both activate and repress uxuB activity depending on its intracellular concentration. We leverage this interaction to implement a novel strategy of regulation within the 5 UTR of an mRNA. Specifically, we report a hierarchical binding strategy that may be leveraged by CsrA within uxuB to result in a dose-dependent response in regulatory outcomes. In our semi-synthetic circuit, the uxuB mRNA leader sequence is used as a scaffold that is fused to a gene of interest, which allows the circuit to transition between ON/OFF states based on a range of free native concentration of the CsrA regulatory protein. Notably, this system exerts regulation comparable to previously developed transcriptional BANDPASS filters while reducing the number of circuit components and can be used in concert with additional controlled circuits to achieve complex multi-signal control.

However, in vivo environments are geometrically, mechanically, and chemically complex, and it has been difficult to understand how each of these parameters contribute to the propulsive strategy utilized by cells in these diverse settings. To address this, we employed a sacrificial micromolding approach to generate polymer substrates with tunable stiffness, controlled adhesivity, and user-defined microscale geometries. We combined this together with live-cell imaging and three-dimensional traction force microscopy (TFM) to quantify the forces that cells use to transit through constricting channels. Surprisingly, we observe that cells migrating through compliant constrictions take longer to transit and experience greater nuclear deformation than those migrating through more rigid constrictions. TFM reveals that this deformation is generated by inwardly directed contractile forces that decrease the size of the opening and pull the walls closed around the nucleus. These findings show that nuclear deformation during confined migration can be accomplished by internal cytoskeletal machinery rather than by reactive forces from the substrate, and our approach provides a mechanism to test between different models for how cells translocate their nucleus through narrow constrictions. The methods, analysis, and results presented here will be useful to understand how cells choose between propulsive strategies in different physical environments.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

This study aimed to investigate the significance of the airborne transmissions and the effectiveness of air cleaning in reducing infections among children in daycare.

MethodsA cross-over study was conducted in four daycare centers in Helsinki. All children attending the daycare were invited to participate (n = 262) and the sole inclusion criterion was that the children were expected to stay in the same day care center for the two-year duration of the study. 51 subjects were included in the final analysis. Clean air flow rate was increased by 2.1-2.9 times compared to baseline mechanical ventilation of the premises. The effect of intervention was assessed using negative binomial regression.

ResultsThe intervention reduced incident infections from 0.95 to 0.78 infections per child per month among the children (primary outcome) in daycare. The reduction attributed to intervention in the statistical model was 18.0 % (95% CI 2.1-31.3 %, p = 0.028).

ConclusionsWe observed a significant decrease in incident infections without implementing any other infection mitigation strategies but air cleaning. Our results challenge the current paradigm which emphasizes fomite and contact transmission and infection control measures that target these pathways. As ventilation and air cleaning can only affect particles able to float in the air stream, our results support the significance of airborne transmission among common respiratory pathogens as well as air cleaning as an infection control measure.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

Within the immune system, key features of physiological hematopoietic cell aging include increased fat deposition in the bone marrow, impaired hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) function, and a propensity towards myeloid differentiation. This shift in lineage bias can lead to pre-malignant bone marrow conditions such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance (CCUS), frequently setting the stage for subsequent development of age-related cancers in myeloid or lymphoid lineages. At the systemic as well as sub-cellular level, human aging has also been associated with diverse lipid alterations, such as decreased phospholipid membrane fluidity that arises as a result of increased saturated fatty acid (FA) accumulation and a decay in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) species by the age of 80 years, however the extent to which impaired FA metabolism contributes to hematopoietic aging is less clear. Here, we performed comprehensive multi-omics analyses and uncovered a role for a key PUFA biosynthesis gene, ELOVL2, in mouse and human immune cell aging. Whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing studies of bone marrow from aged Elovl2 mutant (enzyme-deficient) mice compared with age-matched controls revealed global down-regulation in lymphoid cell markers and expression of genes involved specifically in B cell development. Flow cytometric analyses of immune cell markers confirmed an aging-associated loss of B cell markers that was exacerbated in the bone marrow of Elovl2 mutant mice and unveiled CD79B, a vital molecular regulator of lymphoid progenitor development from the pro-B to pre-B cell stage, as a putative surface biomarker of accelerated immune aging. Complementary lipidomic studies extended these findings to reveal select alterations in lipid species in aged and Elovl2 mutant mouse bone marrow samples, suggesting significant changes in the biophysical properties of cellular membranes. Furthermore, single cell RNA-seq analysis of human HSPCs across the spectrum of human development and aging uncovered a rare subpopulation (<7%) of CD34+ HSPCs that expresses ELOVL2 in healthy adult bone marrow. This HSPC subset, along with CD79B-expressing lymphoid-committed cells, were almost completely absent in CD34+ cells isolated from elderly (>60 years old) bone marrow samples. Together, these findings uncover new roles for lipid metabolism enzymes in the molecular regulation of cellular aging and immune cell function in mouse and human hematopoiesis. In addition, because systemic loss of ELOVL2 enzymatic activity resulted in down-regulation of B cell genes that are also associated with lymphoproliferative neoplasms, this study sheds light on an intriguing metabolic pathway that could be leveraged in future studies as a novel therapeutic modality to target blood cancers or other age-related conditions involving the B cell lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

This has led to unprecedented advancement of gene editing for therapeutic benefit. Initial uses of CRISPR/Cas9 were focused on gene disruption via DNA cleavage, but significant engineering led to systems for single base editing as well as insertion, deletion and manipulation of short stretches of genomic sequences using nicking Cas9 and RT-based methods. These technologies allowed safer and more precise editing but were limited to small corrections and showed significantly reduced efficiencies in nondividing cells, presenting difficulty for translation to in vivo therapies. To find an alternate editing strategy that could address these shortcomings, we revisited the mechanism of DNA nicking by nCas9. nCas9 nicking creates a free 5' phosphate group and a 3' hydroxyl group on the complementary strand of the target sequence. Under ordinary conditions in the cell these ends are re-joined by endogenously expressed ligases to repair DNA back to wild-type. If, however, a DNA fragment containing the desired edit were present, ligation of the nicked genomic DNA with the delivered fragment could result in gene editing. We demonstrate that optimization of each component and introduction of a chemically modified high affinity splinting DNA allows a variety of ligase-based edits, including longer edits not efficient with RT-based systems, at high efficiencies and fidelities that minimize genomic byproducts in both dividing and nondividing cells as well as in vivo in adult mice.

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

The main crossover pathway relies on ZMM proteins, including ZIP4 and HEI10, and is typically resolved by the MLH1/MLH3 heterodimer, MutL{gamma}. Our analysis of plant fertility and bivalent formation revealed that the MUS81 endonuclease can partially compensate for the MutL{gamma} loss. Comparing genome-wide crossover maps of the mlh1 mutant with ZMM-deficient mutants and lines with varying HEI10 levels reveals that while crossover interference persists in mlh1, it is weakened. Additionally, mlh1 show reduced crossover assurance, leading to a higher incidence of aneuploidy in offspring. This is likely due to MUS81 resolving intermediates without the crossover bias seen in MutL{gamma}. Comparing mlh1 mlh3 mus81 and zip4 mus81 mutants suggests that additional crossover pathways emerge in the absence of both MutL{gamma} and MUS81. The loss of MutL{gamma} can also be suppressed by eliminating the FANCM helicase. Elevated expression of MLH1 or MLH3 increases crossover frequency, while their overexpression significantly reduces crossover numbers and plant fertility, highlighting the importance for tight control of MLH1/MLH3 levels. By contrast, PMS1, a component of the MutL endonuclease, appears not to be involved in crossing-over. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique role of MutL{gamma} in ZMM-dependent crossover regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

In 2021, Jesse Bloom reported on the recovery of a dataset of raw sequencing reads that had been removed from the NCBI SRA database at the request of the data generators, a scientific team at Wuhan University (Wang et al., 2020b). Bloom concluded that the data deletion had obfuscated the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that deletion may have been requested to comply with a government order; further, he questioned reported sample collection dates on and after January 30, 2020. Here, we show that sample collection dates were published in 2020 by Wang et al. together with the sequencing reads, and match the dates given by the authors in 2021. Collection dates of January 30, 2020 were manually removed by Bloom during his analysis of the data. We examine mutations in these sequences and confirm that they are entirely consistent with the previously known genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 of late January 2020. Finally, we explain how an apparent phylogenetic rooting paradox described by Bloom was resolved by subsequent analysis. Our reanalysis demonstrates that there was no basis to question the sample collection dates published by Wang et al..

Gram-negatives encode a type VI secretion system (T6SS) that delivers toxins into eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Previous studies highlighted the importance of Salmonella T6SSs in bacterial antagonism and host cell infection, but few antibacterial effectors have been described. Here, we used bioinformatic strategies to identify the T6SS effectors in 10,000 Salmonella genomes. As a result, we identified and manually curated 128 candidates. Specific Salmonella serovars harbor unique effectors that are target-specific (antibacterial or anti-eukaryotic), depending on the T6SS subtype (e.g. i1 or i3). In addition, 45 previously uncharacterized toxin domains were identified and designated STox (Salmonella toxins). STox15 was among the most frequent candidates and was selected for in-depth characterization. STox15 is an antibacterial effector belonging to the NlpC/P60 papain-like fold superfamily with a permuted catalytic core typical of lipid-targeting versions rather than peptidases or amidases. Biochemical analysis with recombinant protein and lipidomics of intoxicated Escherichia coli revealed that STox15 displays phospholipase activity cleaving off acyl groups from phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. This work improves our understanding of the Salmonella T6SS effector repertoire and provides the first direct characterization of a lipid-targeting NlpC/P60 domain in biological conflicts.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

The functionality of these anchors is influenced by the residence time of CTCF on chromatin, which is determined by its binding affinity and its interactions with nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated factors. In this study, we demonstrate that CTCF occupancy is driven by CTCF motifs strategically positioned at the entry sites of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that, upon binding, the N-terminus of CTCF is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF priming nucleosome (CpN). CTCF recognizes its binding sites if they are not methylated. It can then displace the CpN, provided the nucleosome is not marked by CpG methylation or repressive histone modifications. Under these permissive conditions, the N-terminus of CTCF recruits SMARCA5 to reposition the CpN downstream, thereby creating nucleosome-free regions that enhance CTCF occupancy and cohesin stalling. In contrast, when CpNs carry repressive epigenetic marks, CTCF binding is transient, without nucleosome displacement or chromatin opening. In such cases, cohesin is not effectively retained at CTCF binding sites. We propose that the epigenetic status of CpNs governs cell-specific CTCF binding patterns, ensuring the maintenance of chromatin architecture throughout the cell cycle.

Lysogenic bacteriophages can integrate their genome into the bacterial chromosome and are known to promote genetic transfer between bacterial strains. However, the contribution of lysogenic phages to the incidence of AMR is poorly understood. Here, in a set of 187 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from 82 patients with CF, we evaluate the links between prophages and both genomic and phenotypic resistance to five anti-pseudomonal antibiotics: tobramycin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, aztreonam, and tazobactam. We find that P. aeruginosa isolates contain on average 3.06 +/-1.84 (SD) predicted prophages. We find no significant association between the number of prophages per isolate and the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) for any of these antibiotics. We then investigate the relationship between particular prophages and AMR. We identify a single lysogenic phage that is associated with phenotypic resistance to the antibiotic tobramycin. Consistent with this association, we identify AMR genes associated with resistance to tobramycin in these strains and find that they are not encoded directly on prophage sequences. These findings suggest that prophages are infrequently associated with the AMR genes in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

While epigenetic aging clocks have shown accuracy in predicting biological age, they typically provide single estimates for the samples and lack mechanistic insights. In this study, we challenge the paradigm that aging can be sufficiently described with a single biological age estimate. We describe Ageome, a computational framework for measuring the epigenetic age of thousands of molecular pathways simultaneously in mice and humans. Ageome is based on the premise that an organisms overall biological age can be approximated by the collective ages of its functional modules, which may age at different rates and have different biological ages. We show that, unlike conventional clocks, Ageome provides a high-dimensional representation of biological aging across cellular functions, enabling comprehensive assessment of aging dynamics within an individual, in a population, and across species. Application of Ageome to longevity intervention models revealed distinct patterns of pathway-specific age deceleration. Notably, cell reprogramming, while rejuvenating cells, also accelerated aging of some functional modules. When applied to human cohorts, Ageome demonstrated heterogeneity in predictive power for mortality risk, and some modules showed better performance in predicting the onset of age-related diseases, especially cancer, compared to existing clocks. Together, the Ageome framework offers a comprehensive and interpretable approach for assessing aging, providing insights into mechanisms and targets for intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Here, we investigated how the low-dimensional organization of intrinsic functional connectivity patterns based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging relates to brain energy expenditure measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. By incrementally adding more dimensions of brain organization (via functional gradients), we were able to show that increasing amounts of variance in the map of brain energy expenditure could be accounted for. In particular, the brain organization dimensions that explained a large amount of the variance in intrinsic brain function also explained a large amount of the regional variance in the energy expenditure maps. This was particularly true for brain organization maps based on the strongest connections, suggesting that ""weak"" connections may not explain as much energy variance. Notably, our topological model was more effective than random brain organization configurations, suggesting that brain organization may be specifically associated with energy optimization. Finally, using brain asymmetry as a model for metabolic efficiency, we found that optimizing energy expenditure independently in each hemisphere outperformed non-independent optimization. This supports the concept of hemispheric competition rather than lateralization in energy allocation. Our results demonstrate how the spatial organization of functional connections is systematically linked to optimized energy expenditure in the human brain, providing new insights into the metabolic basis of brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

We present evidence that prfB frameshifting autoregulates RF2 levels throughout the bacterial domain since (i) the prfB in-frame stop codon is always TGA or TAA, both of which are recognized by RF2, and never the RF1-specific TAG stop codon, and (ii) species that lack the autoregulatory programmed frameshift likely need higher RF2 levels since, on average, they have significantly higher RF2-specific stop codon usage. Overexpression of prfB without the autoregulatory frameshift motif is toxic to Bacillus subtilis, an organism with intermediate RF2-specific stop codon usage. We did not detect the programmed frameshift in any Actinobacteriota. Consistent with this finding, we observed very low frameshift efficiency at the prfB frameshift motif in the Actinobacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Our work provides a more complete picture of the evolution of the RF2 programmed frameshifting motif, and its usage to prevent toxic overexpression of RF2.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

We have designed and constructed a microfluidic device in which each nanowell contained a single, infected cell (donor) and a single, uninfected cell (recipient). Using a GFP-expressing poliovirus as our model, we observed both lytic and non-lytic spread. Donor cells supporting lytic spread established infection earlier than those supporting non-lytic spread. However, non-lytic spread established infections in recipient cells substantially faster than lytic spread and yielded higher rates of genome replication. While lytic spread was sensitive to the presence of capsid entry/uncoating inhibitors, non-lytic spread was not. Consistent with emerging models for non-lytic spread of enteroviruses using autophagy, reduction of LC3 levels in cells impaired non-lytic spread and elevated the fraction of virus in donor cells spreading lytically. The ability to distinguish lytic and non-lytic spread unambiguously will enable discovery of viral and host factors and host pathways used for non-lytic spread of enteroviruses and other viruses as well.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Symptoms usually manifest in the first year of life and include prolonged severe seizures, developmental delay and severe intellectual disability. DS patients have an increased mortality rate, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Approximately 90% of patients carry a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in the SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium ion channel, NaV1.1. The NaV1.1 channel is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. Previous studies have identified a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) which specifically downregulates SCN1A gene expression. This natural antisense transcript (NAT) can be modulated by AntagoNATs, small synthetic oligonucleotides developed to inhibit NAT function. In a DS mouse model, AntagoNATs were shown to modulate Scn1a expression by targeting the Scn1a NAT, improving seizure frequency after repeated administration. Here, we have developed novel AntagoNATs and incorporated these into a clinically relevant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) gene therapy vector, to test in a DS mouse model (Scn1a+/-) and provide a one-off treatment approach. Eighteen AntagoNATs were tested in vitro; from the best performing candidates, we selected two AntagoNAT sequences (K & H) for in vivo testing as they had the highest homology (90%) to human SCN1A NAT. We administered both vectors to newborn Scn1a+/- mice via intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravenous (IV) injection to target the brain and heart. AAV9-AntagoNAT-H significantly increased survival, decreased febrile seizures and reduced spontaneous seizure frequency compared to the PBS control group. When administered at P14 by ICV and IV injection, AAV9-AntagoNAT-H increased survival. In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated for the first time the delivery of AntagoNAT technology via an AAV9 vector and thus offering the possibility of a one-time treatment for DS patients.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

To address this, non-isotopic ligation-based ultraviolet crosslinking immunoprecipitation6 was combined with mass spectrometry (irCLIP-RNP) to identify RNA-dependent associated proteins (RDAPs) co-bound to RNA with any RBP of interest. irCLIP-RNP defined landscapes of multimeric protein assemblies on RNA, uncovering previously unknown patterns of RBP-RNA associations, including cell-type-selective combinatorial relationships between RDAPs and primary RBPs. irCLIP-RNP also defined dynamic RDAP remodeling in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), uncovering EGF-induced recruitment of UPF1 adjacent to HNRNPC to effect splicing surveillance of cell proliferation mRNAs.

Of the over 1,200 known representatives, many possess potent biological activities, but their drug potential has not been fully realised up until now. A central obstacle is the limited availability of minor withanolides, caused by a lack of knowledge about the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Here, we combine phylogenomics with metabolic engineering to overcome this limitation. By sequencing the genome of the medicinal plant and archetypical withanolide producer ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) and comparing the genome sequences of nine Solanaceae species, we discovered a conserved gene cluster for withanolide biosynthesis, consisting of two sub-gene clusters which differ in their expression patterns. To investigate the functions of the encoded enzymes, we established metabolic engineering platforms in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. This allowed us to reconstitute the first three oxidative steps of withanolide biosynthesis, catalysed by the cytochrome P450 monooxygenases CYP87G1, CYP88C7, and CYP749B2, leading to the aglycone of the known compound withanoside V. Our work sets the basis for the biotechnological production of withanolides in heterologous hosts and will therefore help to fully harness the drug potential of these plant steroids in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Sanger sequencing is commonly used for this analysis; however, amplicon sequencing utilizing next-generation sequencing has become widespread. In addition, long-read amplicon sequencing, using Nanopore or PacBio sequencers to analyze long PCR fragments, has emerged, although it is often more expensive than Sanger sequencing.

Recently, low-cost commercial services for full-length plasmid DNA sequencing using Nanopore sequencers have been launched in several countries, including Japan. This study explored the potential of these services to sequence long PCR fragments without the need for cloning into plasmid DNA. PCR fragments of 4-11 kb, amplified from the DFR-B gene involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanin, with or without Tpn1 transposons in Japanese morning glory (Ipomoea nil), were circularized using T4 ligase and analyzed as templates. Although some inaccuracies in the length of homopolymer stretches were observed, the remaining sequences were obtained without significant errors. This method could potentially reduce the labor and costs associated with cloning, primer synthesis, and sequence assembly, thus making it a viable option for the analysis of long PCR fragment sequences. Moreover, this study reconfirmed that Tpn1 transposons are major mutagens in I. nil and demonstrated their transposition in the Violet line, a long-used standard in plant physiology.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

All CoVs encode a proofreading 3-5 exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 (nsp14-ExoN) that mediates proofreading and high-fidelity replication and is critical for other roles in replication and pathogenesis. The in vitro enzymatic activity of nsp14 ExoN is enhanced in the presence of the cofactor nsp10. We introduced alanine substitutions in nsp14 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) at the nsp14-10 interface and recovered mutant viruses with a range of impairments in replication and in vitro biochemical exonuclease activity. Two of these substitutions, nsp14 K7A and D8A, had impairments intermediate between WT-MHV nsp14 and the known ExoN(-) D89A/E91A nsp14 catalytic inactivation mutant. All introduced nsp14-10 interface alanine substitutions impaired in vitro exonuclease activity. Passage of the K7A and D8A mutant viruses selected second-site non-synonymous mutations in nsp14 associated with improved mutant virus replication and exonuclease activity. These results confirm the essential role of the nsp14-nsp10 interaction for efficient enzymatic activity and virus replication, identify proximal and long-distance determinants of nsp14-nsp10 interaction, and support targeting the nsp14-10 interface for viral inhibition and attenuation.

IMPORTANCECoronavirus replication requires assembly of a replication transcription complex composed of nonstructural proteins (nsp), including polymerase, helicase, exonuclease, capping enzymes, and non-enzymatic cofactors. The coronavirus nsp14 exoribonuclease mediates several functions in the viral life cycle including genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, RNA recombination, RNA proofreading and high-fidelity replication, and native resistance to many nucleoside analogs. The nsp-14 exonuclease activity in vitro requires the non-enzymatic co-factor nsp10, but the determinants and importance the nsp14-10 interactions during viral replication have not been defined. Here we show that for the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus, nsp14 residues at the nsp14-10 interface are essential for efficient viral replication and in vitro exonuclease activity. These results shed new light on the requirements for protein interactions within the coronavirus replication transcription complex, and they may reveal novel non active-site targets for virus inhibition and attenuation.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

We applied ExIGS to fibroblast cells derived from an individual with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome to characterize how variation in nuclear morphology affects spatial chromatin organization. Using this data, we discovered that lamin abnormalities are linked to hotspots of aberrant euchromatin repression that may erode cell identity. Further, we show that lamin abnormalities heterogeneously increase the repressive environment of the nucleus in tissues and aged cells.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

Since large numbers of sedentary individuals evolve to develop cardiometabolic disease, a better understanding of decreased cellular bioenergetics and mitochondrial function is needed in order to improve both diagnosis and treatment of multiple metabolic diseases.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

In the opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, HU is the only identified NAP, and its role in chromosome conformation and other essential processes has not yet been investigated. Here, we use a multi-scale approach to explore the role of HU in chromosome conformation and segregation dynamics. By combining superresolution microscopy and whole-genome binding analysis, we describe the nucleoid as a dynamic structure where HU binds transiently across the entire nucleoid, with a preference for the origin of replication over the terminus. Reducing cellular HU levels impacts nucleoid maintenance and disrupts robust nucleoid scaling with cell size. This effect is similar to the distortion caused by fluoroquinolone-antibiotics, supporting earlier observations that HU is essential for maintaining DNA supercoiling. Furthermore, in cells lacking HU, the replication machinery is misplaced, and cells are unable to initiate and proceed with on-going replication. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments revealed that HU is required to maintain cohesion between the two chromosomal arms, in a similar way to the structural maintenance of the chromosome complex SMC. Together, we show that by promoting long-range chromosome interactions and supporting the architecture of the domain encompassing the origin, HU is fundamental for chromosome integrity and the intimately related processes of chromosome replication and segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed that parafoveal orthographic neighbours (e.g., ""writer"" vs. ""waiter"") showed higher representational similarity than non-neighbours (e.g., ""writer"" vs. ""police""), emerging ~68 ms after fixation onset on the preceding word (e.g., ""clever"") in the visual word form area. Similarly, parafoveal semantic neighbours (e.g., ""writer"" vs. ""author"") exhibited increased representational similarity at ~137 ms in the left inferior frontal gyrus.

Advances in chemical probing techniques have significantly enhanced our ability to identify RNA secondary structures and understand their regulatory roles. These developments, alongside improvements in experimental design and data processing, have greatly increased the resolution and throughput of structural analyses. Here, we introduce SEISMICgraph, a web-based tool designed to support RNA structure research by offering data visualization and analysis capabilities for a variety of chemical probing modalities. SEISMICgraph enables simultaneous comparison of data across different sequences and experimental conditions through a user-friendly interface that requires no programming expertise. We demonstrate its utility by investigating known and putative riboswitches and exploring how RNA modifications influence their structure and binding. SEISMICgraphs ability to rapidly visualize adenine-dependent structural changes and assess the impact of pseudouridylation on these transitions provides novel insights and establishes a roadmap for numerous future applications.

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

ME/CFS diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME/CFS patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME/CFS cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME/CFS status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME/CFS cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME/CFS status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME/CFS status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME/CFS diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617652

Both at tissue-specific or pan-tissue levels, the clocks are biphasic, capable of predicting age during early life but not for the rest of its lifespan. We show that axolotls exhibit evolutionarily conserved features of epigenetic ageing during early life, yet their methylome is remarkably stable across lifespan, including at Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target sites, suggesting that this species deviates from known patterns of epigenetic ageing.

M25 employs aberration-corrected Multifocus microscopy--an optical method where diffractive Fourier optics are used for multiplexing and refocusing light-- with a simplified design for chromatic dispersion correction where a corrective diffractive gratings is placed on each camera in the array. This elegant architecture for chromatic correction will be applicable in a broad range of diffractive imaging applications. M25 is a powerful optical tool for high-speed 3D microscopy in that it allows both non-invasive, label-free bright-field and highly sensitive fluorescence microscopy. We showcase M25 capabilities in 3D particle tracking, bright-field, and fluorescence imaging in D. melanogaster, and locomotion and neural activity studies in C. elegans.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617652

Recombination rates are widely observed to negatively associate with the abundance of transposable elements (TEs), selfish genetic elements that move between genomic locations. While such associations are usually interpreted as recombination influencing the efficacy of selection at removing TEs, accumulating findings suggest that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked a novel approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches-analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing mobilome can actively modify recombination landscapes, shaping genome evolution within and between species.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

However, our understanding of how sequence variation impacts the functional activity of RDs is limited. To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet (Transcriptional Effector Network) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs. Our work highlights critical considerations for future dataset design and model training strategies to improve functional variant prioritization and precision design of synthetic regulatory proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer, HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim. Each tool is specific, reversible, and capable of breaking neural circuits at precise locations.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

In cell culture this can occur by the induction of intercellular membrane connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures (TLSs), which are capable of trafficking the viral genome between cells. Here, we showed that TLSs are present at the site of IAV infections in vivo, and then used in vitro models to ask how IAVs induce their formation. We found that TLS induction cannot be induced by cytokine signalling from infected to uninfected cells, but requires IAV replication within cells. IAV replication can form filamentous virions with structural similarities to TLSs, but we found that TLS induction is independent of virion morphology. We therefore looked at the intracellular responses to infection. Using a pan-caspase inhibitor, we found that TLS induction by IAVs requires the onset of apoptosis. Our results, which suggest that IAVs control their ability to spread directly from cell to cell by driving infected cells into apoptosis, identifies a new way in which a virus can manipulate its host to evade antiviral immune responses.

Author SummaryInfluenza A viruses (IAVs) spread efficiently through the respiratory tract in the form of extracellular virus particles, but can be restricted by neutralising antibodies and antiviral drugs. IAVs can avoid this restriction by transporting viral genomes directly from one cell to the next. They can do this by inducing the formation of long, thin intercellular connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures, which are capable of trafficking viral genomes. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that tunnelling-nanotube like structures form within IAV infected lungs. We then asked how IAVs induce these structures. We found that cell death pathways triggered by IAV replication induce the formation of tunnelling nanotube-like structures, thereby establishing routes of infection spread to other cells. In this way, the virus exploits the cell death response of its host to ensure that its infection can continue to spread even within the restrictive environment of the respiratory tract.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617653

As such, the endolysosomal system plays a critical role in determining the abundance of proteins on the cell surface, influencing cellular identity and function. Highly polarized cells, like neurons, rely on the endolysosomal system for axonal and dendritic specialization and synaptic compartmentalization. The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinsons to Alzheimers disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets.

Duplicated genes expanded uniquely in the human lineage likely contributed to brain evolution, including the increased complexity of synaptic connections between neurons and the dramatic expansion of the neocortex. Discovering duplicate genes is challenging because the similarity of paralogs makes them prone to sequence-assembly errors. To mitigate this issue, we analyzed a complete telomere-to-telomere human genome sequence (T2T-CHM13) and identified 213 duplicated gene families likely containing human-specific paralogs (>98% identity). Positing that genes important in universal human brain features should exist with at least one copy in all modern humans and exhibit expression in the brain, we narrowed in on 362 paralogs with at least one copy across thousands of ancestrally diverse genomes and present in human brain transcriptomes. Of these, 38 paralogs co-express in gene modules enriched for autism-associated genes and potentially contribute to human language and cognition. We narrowed in on 13 duplicate gene families with human-specific paralogs that are fixed among modern humans and show convincing brain expression patterns. Using long-read DNA sequencing revealed hidden variation across 200 modern humans of diverse ancestries, uncovering signatures of selection not previously identified, including possible balancing selection of CD8B.

Addressing this gap, we introduce FROG analysis, a community-driven initiative aimed at standardizing reproducibility assessments of CBMs and GEMs. The FROG framework encompasses four key analyses--Flux variability, Reaction deletion, Objective function, and Gene deletion--to produce standardized, numerically reproducible FROG reports. These reports serve as reference datasets, enabling model evaluators, curators, and independent researchers to verify the reproducibility of GEMs systematically.

BioModels, a leading repository of systems biology models, has integrated FROG analysis into its curation workflow, enhancing the reproducibility and reusability of submitted GEMs. In our study evaluating 65 GEM submissions from the community, approximately 40% reproduced without intervention, 28% requiring minor adjustments, and 32% needing input from authors. The standardization introduced by FROG analysis facilitated the detection and resolution of issues, ultimately leading to the successful reproduction of all models.

Langerhans cells reside in the epidermis and extend dynamic dendrites in close proximity to adjacent keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. We find that homeostatic Langerhans cells exhibit spontaneous and transient changes in calcium activity, with calcium flux occurring primarily in the cell body and rarely in the dendrites. Triggering somatosensory axon degeneration increases the frequency of calcium activity in Langerhans cell dendrites. By contrast, we show that Langerhans cells exhibit a sustained increase in intracellular calcium following engulfment of damaged keratinocytes. Altering intracellular calcium activity leads to a decrease in engulfment efficiency of keratinocyte debris. Our findings demonstrate that Langerhans cells exhibit context-specific changes in calcium activity and highlight the utility of skin as an accessible model for imaging calcium dynamics in tissue-resident macrophages.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTO_LICalcium activity in immune cells is thought to regulate cell function, but studies focusing on tissue-resident macrophages are limited.
C_LIO_LISkin-resident macrophages known as Langerhans cells exhibit rapid and transient changes in calcium activity in homeostatic conditions, which can change depending on the type of tissue injury inflicted.

Mitigation of arboviral outbreaks relies largely on the use of insecticides, but the effectiveness of such responses is threatened by the evolution of insecticide resistance. Monitoring mosquito susceptibility to different insecticides is therefore vital for informed decisions regarding outbreak responses. In this study, we elucidate the patterns of resistance to two insecticide classes within the primary vectors of West Nile virus in the northeast and midwestern regions of the continental United States, Culex pipiens and Culex restuans.

Methodology/Principal FindingsEgg collections were performed throughout Illinois from 2018-2020, and adults were tested for insecticide resistance to permethrin and malathion. Individuals from each sampling location were sequenced to determine the presence of kdr target-site mutations, and biochemical assays were performed to determine increases in detoxification enzymes and insensitive acetylcholinesterase. Results from the bottle assays indicate variable resistance rates in Illinois, however lowered mortality was found in most of the regions that were tested. The kdr mutation (L1014F) was present in 50% of Culex pipiens sequenced, and more prevalent in southern Illinois compared with northern and central (p < 0.001). Different mechanisms were predictive of resistance by species and insecticide, with permethrin resistance being affected by kdr-allele frequency and oxidase levels and malathion resistance by - and {beta}-esterases in Cx. pipiens. For Cx. restuans -esterase and oxidase levels were predictive of permethrin resistance while {beta}-esterase and insensitive acetylcholinesterase levels were predictive of malathion resistance.

Conclusions/SignificanceWe documented variation in insecticide resistance levels that appear to be driven by population differences in kdr mutation rates and metabolic resistance mechanisms. The presence of different mechanisms in species and regions has implications for approaches to resistance management and highlights the need to implement and maintain insecticide resistance monitoring practices.

Author SummaryMosquitoes are the vectors of many major diseases including malaria, dengue, yellow fever, zika, and West Nile virus. Insecticides are often used to control mosquitoes and the outbreaks they cause. However, evidence has shown that populations of different mosquito species worldwide have developed resistance to our most common insecticides. This study shows that West Nile virus vectors in Illinois, (Culex pipiens and Culex restuans) are no exception to this trend. Egg collections were made throughout the state during the 2018-2020 field seasons and the resulting adults were tested for resistance to two common insecticides using the CDCs bottle bioassay protocol. The results indicate that rates of resistance vary throughout the state and population differences in resistance mechanisms are driving this variation.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

We aimed to test whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using different epigenetic clocks predict long-term overall, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 2,105 participants to the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged [&ge;]50 years old who were followed for mortality through 2019. EAAs was calculated from the residuals of Horvath, Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Zhang, Lin, Weidner, Vidal-Bralo and Grim epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age. Using cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of EAA (per 5-year) and the DunedinPoAm pace of aging (per 10% increase) with overall, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, adjusting for covariates and white blood cell composition.

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim EAA (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32-1.71) followed by Hannum (P = 0.001; HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.27), Pheno (P = 0.001; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), Horvath (P = 0.007; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.22) and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.008; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) EAAs.

We show kaposin RNA is both necessary and sufficient for NS remodelling, and ablating kaposin colocalization with NSs using kaposin-deficient recombinant viruses impairs viral gene expression. This is the first example of an RNA (cellular or viral) capable of scaffolding NS and the first study to define kaposin as an important regulator of KSHV gene expression and, by extension, KSHV-associated disease.

We reasoned that while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state an entirely atomic level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding, and given a description of the larger protein context, and builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking. Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a kcat/KM of 11000 M-1min- 1, considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

This global analysis identified 60,024 high confidence substitutions corresponding to 8,801 unique sites in 1,990 proteins. Some substitutions are shared across samples, while others exhibit strong tissue-type and cancer specificity. Surprisingly, products of alternate translation are more abundant than their canonical counterparts for hundreds of proteins, suggesting sense codon recoding. Recoded proteins include transcription factors, proteases, signaling proteins, and proteins associated with neurodegeneration. Mechanisms contributing to substitution abun-dance include protein stability, codon frequency, codon-anticodon mismatches, and RNA modifications. We characterize sequence motifs around alternatively translated amino acids and how substitution ratios vary across protein domains, tissue types and cancers. Both the sequence and the tissue-specificity of alternatively translated proteins are conserved between human and mouse.

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted.

Attention can also be seen as a solution to the binding problem: concurrent attention to all parts of an entity allows separating it from the rest. However, the rich models of attention in computational neuroscience are generally not scaled to real-world problems and there are thus many behavioral and neural phenomena that current models cannot explain. Here, we propose a bidirectional recurrent model of attention that is inspired by modern neural networks for image segmentation. It conceptualizes recurrent connections as a multi-stage internal gating process where bottom-up connections transmit features, while top-down and lateral connections transmit attentional gating signals. Our model can recognize and segment simple stimuli such as digits as well as objects in natural images and is able to be prompted with object labels, attributes or locations. It can learn to perform a range of behavioral findings, such as object binding, selective attention, inhibition of return, and visual search. It also replicates a variety of neural findings, including increased activity for attended objects, features, and locations, attention-invariant tuning, and relatively late onset attention. Most importantly, our proposed model unifies decades of cognitive and neurophysiological findings of visual attention into a single principled architecture. Our results highlight that the ability to selectively and dynamically focus on specific parts of stimulus streams can help artificial neural networks to better generalize and align with human brains.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

But the fundamental question remains: what has been missed in prior genomic analyses? Over the past decade, the translation of non-canonical open reading frames (ncORFs) has been observed across human cell types and disease states, with major implications for proteomics, genomics, and clinical science. However, the impact of ncORFs has been limited by the absence of a large-scale understanding of their contribution to the human proteome. Here, we report the collaborative efforts of stakeholders in proteomics, immunopeptidomics, Ribo-seq ORF discovery, and gene annotation, to produce a consensus landscape of protein-level evidence for ncORFs. We show that at least 25% of a set of 7,264 ncORFs give rise to translated gene products, yielding over 3,000 peptides in a pan-proteome analysis encompassing 3.8 billion mass spectra from 95,520 experiments. With these data, we developed an annotation framework for ncORFs and created public tools for researchers through GENCODE and PeptideAtlas. This work will provide a platform to advance ncORF-derived proteins in biomedical discovery and, beyond humans, diverse animals and plants where ncORFs are similarly observed.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts.

Using electromagnetic waves represents an alternative strategy to inactivate pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and reduce overall transmission. However, whether electromagnetic waves reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is unclear. Here, we adapted a coplanar waveguide (CPW) to identify electromagnetic waves that could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs). Treatment of SC2-VLPs, particularly at frequencies between 2.5-3.5 GHz at an electric field of 400 V/m for 2 minutes, reduced infectivity. Exposure to a frequency of 3.1 GHz decreased the binding of SC2-VLPs to antibodies directed against the Spike S1 subunit receptor binding domain (RBD). These results suggest that electromagnetic waves alter the conformation of Spike, thereby reducing viral attachment to host cell receptors. Overall, this data provides proof-of-concept in using electromagnetic waves for sanitation and prevention efforts to curb the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other pathogenic enveloped viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727820617653

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or if a more generic computation can account for these observations. To disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice where space, auditory tones, rewards, and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans toward deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for the evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages:  Opimoda+ and  Diphoda+. Compellingly, this position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses.

Not only is it important to understand how coordinated changes in circuit parameters alter neural activity, but also when dynamics are unaffected by--or invariant to--such changes. Computational modeling has revealed invariances in single neurons and small circuits that are thought to reflect their robustness against variability and perturbations. However, generalizing these insights to larger circuits in cortex and other brain areas remains challenging. A key bottleneck lies in inverse modeling of neural circuits with spiking network models, i.e., identifying parameter configurations that quantitatively match dynamics observed in neural recordings. Here, we present Automated Model Inference from Neural Dynamics (AutoMIND) for efficient discovery of invariant circuit model configurations. AutoMIND leverages a mechanistic model with adaptive spiking neurons and clustered connectivity, which displays a rich variety of spatiotemporal dynamics. Probabilistic deep generative models--trained on network simulations only--then returns many parameter configurations consistent with a given target observation of neural activity. Applied to several datasets, AutoMIND discovers circuit models of synchronous network bursting in human brain organoids across early development, as well as models capturing complex frequency profiles of Neuropixels recordings in mouse hippocampus and cortex. In each case, we obtain hundreds of configurations that compose a (nonlinear) parameter subspace in which population dynamics remain unchanged. Surprisingly, global and local geometries of the invariant subspace are not fixed, but differ for different dynamics. Together, our results shed light on dynamic-dependent invariances of circuit parameters underlying diverse population dynamics, while demonstrating the flexibility of AutoMIND for inverse modeling of neural circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Successfully adapting to a new environment with different access to food, shelter, and other resources requires rapid physiological and behavioural changes, which could potentially be facilitated by gut microbiota plasticity. To investigate whether alterations in gut microbiota support this transition to a feral lifestyle, we analysed the gut microbiomes of domestic and feral cats from six geographically diverse locations using genome-resolved metagenomics. By reconstructing 229 draft genomes from 92 cats, we identified a typical carnivore microbiome structure, with notable diversity and taxonomic differences across regions. While overall diversity metrics did not differ significantly between domestic and feral cats, hierarchical modelling of species communities, accounting for geographic and sex covariates, revealed distinct taxonomic and functional profiles between the two groups. While taxonomic enrichment was balanced, microbial functional capacities were significantly enriched in feral cats. These functional enhancements, particularly in amino acid and lipid degradation, correspond to feral cats dietary reliance on crude protein and fat. Additionally, functional differences were consistent with behavioural contrasts, such as the more aggressive and elusive behaviour measured in feral cats compared to the docile behaviour of domestic cats. Finally, the observed enrichment in short-chain fatty acid, neurotransmitter, and vitamin B12 production in feral cats aligns with improved cognitive function and potentially contributes to their heightened aggression and elusiveness. Our findings suggest that microbiome shifts may play a significant role in the development of physiological and behavioural traits advantageous for a feral lifestyle, supporting the adaptive success of feral cats in the wild.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

However, a central challenge has been the question of how to identify the parameters of detailed biophysical models such that they match physiological measurements at scale or such that they perform computational tasks. Here, we describe a framework for simulation of detailed biophysical models in neuroscience--JO_SCPLOWAXLEYC_SCPLOW--which addresses this challenge. By making use of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, JO_SCPLOWAXLEYC_SCPLOW opens up the possibility to efficiently optimize large-scale biophysical models with gradient descent. We show that JO_SCPLOWAXLEYC_SCPLOW can learn parameters of biophysical neuron models with several hundreds of parameters to match voltage or two photon calcium recordings, sometimes orders of magnitude more efficiently than previous methods. We then demonstrate that JO_SCPLOWAXLEYC_SCPLOW makes it possible to train biophysical neuron models to perform computational tasks. We train a recurrent neural network to perform working memory tasks, and a feedforward network of morphologically detailed neurons with 100,000 parameters to solve a computer vision task.

Although signaling circuits and gene regulatory networks that regulate pluripotent stem cell differentiation have been intensely studied, how these networks are integrated in space and time with morphological transitions and mechanical deformations to control state transitions remains a fundamental open question. Here, we focus on two distinct models of pluripotency, primed pluripotent stem cells and pre-implantation inner cell mass cells of human embryos to discover that cell fate transitions associate with rapid changes in nuclear shape and volume which collectively alter the nuclear mechanophenotype. Mechanistic studies in human induced pluripotent stem cells further reveal that these phenotypical changes and the associated active fluctuations of the nuclear envelope arise from growth factor signaling-controlled changes in chromatin mechanics and cytoskeletal confinement. These collective mechano-osmotic changes trigger global transcriptional repression and a condensation-prone environment that primes chromatin for a cell fate transition by attenuating repression of differentiation genes. However, while this mechano-osmotic chromatin priming has the potential to accelerate fate transitions and differentiation, sustained biochemical signals are required for robust induction of specific lineages. Our findings uncover a critical mechanochemical feedback mechanism that integrates nuclear mechanics, shape and volume with biochemical signaling and chromatin state to control cell fate transition dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Moreover, variants associated with blood cell phenotypes are enriched in regulatory regions active during hematopoiesis. To systematically explore the nature of these regions, we developed a highly efficient strategy, Perturb-multiome, that makes it possible to simultaneously profile both chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single cells with CRISPR-mediated perturbation of a range of master transcription factors (TFs). This approach allowed us to examine the connection between TFs, accessible regions, and gene expression across the genome throughout hematopoietic differentiation. We discovered that variants within the TF-sensitive accessible chromatin regions, while representing less than 0.3% of the genome, show a [~]100-fold enrichment in heritability across certain blood cell phenotypes; this enrichment is strikingly higher than for other accessible chromatin regions. Our approach facilitates large-scale mechanistic understanding of phenotype-associated genetic variants by connecting key cis-regulatory elements and their target genes within gene regulatory networks.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Such defenses include venoms that deter predators by targeting nociceptive (pain-sensing) pathways. Through co-evolution, venom toxins can become extremely efficient modulators of their molecular targets. The venom of velvet ants (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae) is notoriously painful. The intensity of a velvet ant sting has been described as ""Explosive and long lasting, you sound insane as you scream. Hot oil from the deep fryer spilling over your entire hand."" [1] The effectiveness of the velvet ant sting as a deterrent against potential predators has been shown across vertebrate orders, including mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds [2-4]. The venoms low toxicity suggests it has a targeted effect on nociceptive sensory mechanisms [5]. This leads to the hypothesis that velvet ant venom targets a conserved nociception mechanism, which we sought to uncover using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system. Drosophila larvae have peripheral sensory neurons that sense potentially damaging (noxious) stimuli such as high temperature, harsh mechanical touch, and noxious chemicals [6-9]. These polymodal nociceptors are called class IV multidendritic dendritic arborizing (cIV da) neurons, and they share many features with vertebrate nociceptors, including conserved sensory receptor channels [10,11]. We found that velvet ant venom strongly activated Drosophila nociceptors through heteromeric Pickpocket/Balboa (Ppk/Bba) ion channels. Furthermore, we found a single venom peptide (Do6a) that activated larval nociceptors at nanomolar concentrations through Ppk/Bba. Drosophila Ppk/Bba is homologous to mammalian Acid Sensing Ion Channels (ASICs) [12]. However, the Do6a peptide did not produce behavioral signs of nociception in mice, which was instead triggered by other non-specific, less potent, peptides within the venom. This suggests that Do6a is an insect-specific venom component that potently activates insect nociceptors. Consistent with this, we showed that the velvet ants defensive sting produced aversive behavior in a predatory praying mantis. Together, our results indicate that velvet ant venom evolved to target nociceptive systems of both vertebrates and invertebrates, but through different molecular mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653

Here, we introduce a whole-embryo imaging platform using multiplexed error-robust fluorescent in-situ hybridization (weMERFISH). We quantified the expression of 495 genes in whole-mount zebrafish embryos at subcellular resolution. Integration with single-cell multiomics data generated an atlas detailing the expression of 25,872 genes and the accessibility of 294,954 chromatin regions, explorable with an online interface MERFISHEYES (beta version). We found that temporal gene expression aligns with cellular maturation and morphogenetic movements, diverse expression patterns correspond to composites of tissue-specific accessible elements, and changes in gene expression generate sharp boundaries during gastrulation. These results establish a novel approach for whole-organism spatial transcriptomics, provide a comprehensive spatially resolved atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and reveal the diversity, precision and emergence of embryonic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1727820617653
