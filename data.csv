Little is known, however, about how serotonin affects downstream populations of neurons and how this modulation might support its cognitive functions. Here, we optogenetically stimulated serotonergic neurons in the DRN while recording large parts of the brain with Neuropixels during quiet wakefulness and performance of a perceptual decision-making task. During quiet wakefulness, 5-HT stimulation induced a rapid switch in internal state, as indicated by dilation of the pupil, suppression of hippocampal sharp wave ripples, and increased exploratory behaviors, such as whisking. To elucidate the brain-wide effect of serotonin release we performed acute Neuropixel recordings in seven target locations, a total of 7,478 neurons were recorded across 17 mice. We found that 5-HT stimulation significantly modulated neural activity in all the recorded brain regions, both during quiet wakefulness and task performance. During task performance, however, we observed no change in behavior when stimulating 5-HT. We found that the 5-HT modulation of high-dimensional neural dynamics is confined to a subspace which is orthogonal relative to the choice axis. These observations describe a possible mechanism for the induction of state-dependent stimulus representations, suggesting a neural basis for neuromodulatory effects on brain-wide circuits to flexible decision-making.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

To inform new global conservation policy, Shaw et al.1 conducted a meta-analysis of temporal genetic diversity data for over 600 wild species spanning a median of 7 years, reporting significant overall diversity loss of effect size g = -0.1. My re-analysis translating this effect to percentage change finds no robust statistical support for consistent decline, with overall changes near zero: from -1% to +1% diversity change depending on the averaging method. When testing each species individually, roughly half increased and half decreased in diversity. While genetic diversity is expected to decline following population losses, evolutionary theory predicts such declines substantially lag behind population reductions, and thus should not be measurable on average at the timescales in Shaw's data, except in dramatically collapsing species. However, conservation policy should not wait for consistently measurable genetic diversity loss--to avoid future lagging losses, we must protect populations now.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

ITs are dynamically regulated by behavioral context and cognitive demands, making them suitable for mapping high-level cognitive phenomena onto the underlying neural computations. In particular, IT measurements derived from single-unit activity (SUA) offer fine-grained resolution, critical for mechanistically linking individual neuron dynamics to cognition. However, current methods for estimating ITs from SUA suffer significant biases and instabilities, particularly when applied to sparse, noisy, or epoched neural spike data. Here, we introduce the intrinsic Spike Time Tiling Coefficient (iSTTC), a novel metric specifically developed to address these limitations. Leveraging synthetic and experimental single-unit recordings, we systematically assessed the performance of iSTTC relative to traditional approaches. Our findings demonstrate that iSTTC provides more accurate estimates of neural timescales across a wide range of conditions, reducing estimation error especially under challenging yet biologically relevant conditions. Crucially, iSTTC can be applied to both continuous and epoched data, overcoming a critical limitation of existing methods. Furthermore, iSTTC substantially relaxes inclusion criteria, increasing the fraction of neurons suitable for analysis and thereby improving the representativeness and robustness of IT measurements. The methodological advances introduced by iSTTC represent a substantial step forward in accurately capturing neural circuit dynamics, ultimately enhancing our ability to link neural mechanisms to cognitive phenomena.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Ancient DNA confirmed descent from King Bela III (Arpad dynasty) and Y-chromosomal affiliation with the Rurikid lineage. Forensic evidence revealed 26 perimortem injuries, suggesting a coordinated, premeditated assassination involving at least three assailants. The pattern of injuries indicates both planning and intense emotional involvement.

Here we report the first adult fly connectome that unites the brain and ventral nerve cord, and we leverage this resource to investigate principles of neural control. We show that effector cells (motor neurons, endocrine cells and efferent neurons targeting the viscera) are primarily influenced by local sensory cells in the same body part, forming local feedback loops. These local loops are linked by long-range circuits involving ascending and descending neurons organized into behavior-centric modules. Single ascending and descending neurons are often positioned to influence the voluntary movements of multiple body parts, together with endocrine cells or visceral organs that support those movements. Brain regions involved in learning and navigation supervise these circuits.

These genomically-encoded technologies spread themselves through target populations by creating double-stranded DNA breaks on homologous chromosomes, into which the homing-drives are copied ( homed). Homing is dependent on sequence homology between the genomic regions flanking the transgene insertion and the break site. Homing efficiency (i.e. copying rate) substantially impacts the power of these systems: less efficient homing-drives spread slower, have fewer applications and are more resistance-prone. Understanding what influences homing-drive efficiency is therefore vital to the successful use of these technologies. Here we report a novel mechanism by which a homing-drives efficiency can be significantly impaired by natural sequence variation within a population into which it is spreading. Using a kmo-targeting  split homing-drive in the West Nile virus mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, we found that target-site heterology (sequence mismatch between the genomic regions flanking the target cut-site and the homing-drive transgene) of less than 10% reduced homing efficiency by up to 54%. While substantial research effort has been dedicated to increasing homing-drive efficiency through optimisation of within-construct components, our results highlight that the real-world efficacy of these systems may in part depend on variation beyond these controllable factors.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

We report that Notch3 signaling levels match NSC quiescence and stemness levels. In physical space, Notch3 signaling is patterned and high signaling levels surround N3ICDlow cells, which also express the deltaA (dla) ligand. Another ligand, jagged1b (jag1b), expressed in all NSCs, positively interacts with Notch3 and sustains expression of the stemness factor Sox2. Finally, lowering jag1b preserves the structured distribution of Notch3 signaling levels in space but attenuates their variance. We propose that Notch3 signaling integrates Dla-mediated lateral inhibition and Jag1b-mediated lateral induction to control quiescence and stemness and their spatiotemporal dynamics in adult NSCs.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Labex Revive ANR-10-LABX-0073;""},{""name"":""La Ligue Contre le Cancer"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rkrv905"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LNCC EL2019 BALLY-CUIF;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQU202203014636;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC SyG PEPS 101071786;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Early genetic studies confirmed hybrids beyond F1, but details remained unclear due to low-resolution methods. Both species were hunted for centuries, but anthropogenic pressures during the 20th-century caused severe bottlenecks in the sable followed by hunting bans and large-scale reintroduction programs across much of its range, including the sympatric zone, potentially affecting hybridization. We resequenced 30 individuals from most of the sables range and Eastern part of pine martens. Among samples, we found a broad spectrum of hybrid types with mosaic recombinant chromosomes that confirm hybrid fertility and indicate crossover is not suppressed in kidases. This necessitates re-evaluation of previous research, as we detected notable discrepancies between STR-based ancestry and whole-genome analysis. In pine martens, we revealed mitochondrial DNA introgression from sables, indicating displacement of native pine marten mitochondrial sequences. Pine marten heterozygosity is relatively low (~0.5-0.6 hetSNPs/kbp) while sable diversity (~1.5-1.8 hetSNPs/kbp) is unexpectedly high for a species with its demographic history, likely reflecting successful reintroduction programs.

Here, we conclude that it does not require much at all. It does not require knowing secondary structures; it does not require aligning the sequences; and it does not require many parameters. We selected a probabilistic model of palindromes (a stochastic context-free grammar or SCFG) with a total of just 21 parameters. Using standard deep learning techniques, we estimate its parameters by implementing the generative process in an automatic differentiation (autodiff) framework and applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We define and minimize a loss function that does not use any structural or alignment information. Trained on as few as fifty RNA sequences, the rules of RNA base pairing emerge after only a few iterations of SGD. Crucially, the sole inputs are RNA sequences. When optimizing for sequences corresponding to structured RNAs, SGD also yields the rules of RNA base-pair aggregation into helices. Trained on shuffled sequences, the system optimizes by avoiding base pairing altogether. Trained on messenger RNAs, it reveals interactions that are different from those of structural RNAs, and specific to each mRNA. Our results show that the emergence of canonical base-pairing can be attributed to sequence-level signals that are robust and detectable even without labeled structures or alignments, and with very few parameters. Autodiff algorithms for probabilistic models, such as, but not restricted to SCFGs, have significant potential as they allow these models to be incorporated into end- to-end RNA deep learning methods for discerning transcripts of different functionalities.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01-GM144423;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UWSC13223;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Hypotheses for such computations include predictive coding, predictive routing, efficient coding, and others. However, single-neuron recordings capture only the individual elements of the hypothesized laminar microcircuit, while local field potentials (LFPs) from a laminar probe offer insight into the broader population activity. Through the Allen Institutes OpenScope Brain Observatory, data in mice performing a visual oddball task during multi-area laminar recording was used to test predictive processing hypotheses in the spectral domain. Histological labeling of the cortical laminae enabled a fine-grained examination of their roles in the task, and frequency bands capturing both feedforward and feedback effects were analyzed. {gamma}-band local-field potential (LFP) oscillations conveyed feedforward prediction errors in lower sensory areas of cortex; /{beta}-band oscillations weakened in unpredictable conditions compared to predictable ones; and {theta}-band oscillations additionally signalled slower, longer-scale temporal prediction errors. In combination with the previous findings, predictive routing explains these experiments where neither ubiquitous predictive coding nor feedforward adaptation can.

SignificanceCortical columns robustly signal perceptual features through the firing rates of spiking neurons. In accordance with this rate coding, predictive processing theories hypothesized that neuronal firing rates ubiquitously signal surprise. However, a recent large-scale study of spike rates did not support this conjecture. An alternate model, predictive routing, suggests that neuronal oscillations rather than spike rates could encode surprise. These neuronal oscillations, which can affect the timing but not rate of spiking, formed coherent {gamma} rhythms which consistently signaled both simpler and more complex forms of surprise in mouse visual cortex. Together with the findings on spike-rates in the same experiment, our findings suggest that cortical circuits encode surprise in the rhythmic timing of spikes rather than in their rate.","[{""name"":""NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2339210;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization (HFSPO)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0001/2023-L;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Veni.232.110;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Multipass transmembrane proteins have increased propensity to be targeted by the RQC, raising the question of whether problems in transmembrane domain insertion and assembly can also cause RQC-eliciting translational arrests. Here, we investigate RQC-mediated quality control of CFTR, a large transmembrane protein mutated in cystic fibrosis. Reporter assays show that although a sizeable fraction of nascent CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells arrests during translation and activates the RQC, multiple interventions compromising CFTR folding and membrane insertion do not exacerbate this response. CFTR translation abortion was also largely unaffected by regulators of translation kinetics such as codon usage, the ribosome collision sensor GCN1, and the SRP ER targeting complex. We propose that the RQC can be triggered by the inherent difficulties in synthesizing transmembrane segments, resulting from their inappropriate interaction with the protein synthesis machinery. Our study uncovers a novel physiological role for the RQC and points to new therapeutic targets for cystic fibrosis.","[{""name"":""Fritz Thyssen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00f3sc705"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""10.22.2.029MN;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""540625656;CRC1678 project number 520471345;""},{""name"":""Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JRG-05 and CAP-33;""},{""name"":""Köln Fortune Program, Faculty of Medicine, University of Cologne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""376/2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

However, achieving precise control over tissue mechanics to direct specific morphogenetic outcomes remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a strategy to program tissue shape transformations through the nematic organization of cellular forces. By precisely controlling nematic order and topological defects, we generate millimeter-scale tissues programmed with specific multicellular tension fields. Using a theoretical framework that integrates contractile nematics with thin sheet mechanics, we explore the role of nematically guided tensions in shape morphogenesis. Experimentally, upon tissue detachment, nematically guided tension fields drive out-of-plane deformations, generating reproducible 3D shapes. By integrating tissue contractility and nematic patterning, our approach offers a robust framework for the rational design of shape-programmable living surfaces.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD115268;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

With the increasing accuracy and accessibility of de novo protein design, faster and cheaper experimental screening methods would democratize and accelerate the identification of high-affinity binders. Here we present Cell-Free Two-Hybrid (CF2H), a rapid and sensitive method for detecting high-affinity protein-protein interactions (PPI) that does not require cloning, protein purification nor high-end laboratory equipment. CF2H uses a dimerization-activated DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to prey and bait proteins to trigger transcription upon protein-protein interaction. We demonstrate that CF2H enables the detection of interactions between various types of target and binder proteins such as single-domain antibodies, DARPins and de novo designed binders. We benchmark CF2H as a screening platform by validating previously reported binders for Mdm2 and discover high-affinity binders targeting the checkpoint inhibitor PD-L1 in less than 24 hours. Finally, we show that CF2H can be used to characterize small-molecules modulators of PPI and detect protein biomarkers, opening the door for a new class of cell-free biosensors.","[{""name"":""Inserm"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02vjkv261"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""965018;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","[{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Grant Agreement No.101034413;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ActinID, 101076260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

Viruses can inhibit nucleotide immune signaling by producing proteins that sequester or cleave the immune signals. Here we analyzed evolutionarily unrelated signal-sequestering viral proteins, finding that they share structural and biophysical traits in their genetic organization, ternary structures and binding pocket properties. Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6. Our study explains how phages commonly evade bacterial immune signaling, and offers a structure-guided analytical approach for discovery of viral immune-manipulating proteins in any database of choice.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1754431834701

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the initiation of actin assembly has remained a mystery. Here we show that S. cerevisiae Ldb17, the homolog of Dip1, functions as an on-switch for endocytic actin assembly. Unexpectedly, the regulation of Ldb17 is more complicated than that of constitutively active Dip1. Ldb17 is controlled by a coat protein, Sla1, via separate recruitment and activation steps. This regulation was likely lost in the S. pombe lineage and this simplification may be related to other changes in actin assembly between these species.

We infer that downstream immune execution is shaped not only by immune receptor activation, but also by cell identity and its associated transcriptional regulatory context, including local transcription factor availability and chromatin accessibility. We further demonstrate that transcriptional regulators preferentially induced in epidermal cells are required to restrict invasion by non-adapted pathogens.
