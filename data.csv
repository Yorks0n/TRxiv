Regulation of cell death is mostly orchestrated by the activation of Caspases, proteases which were long thought to trigger an irreversible engagement in cell death. However, recent data in vivo and in vitro outline numerous non-apoptotic functions of caspases as well as quite ubiquitous sublethal activation of effector caspases during development. Yet, it remains unclear in many instances what drives the bifurcation between cell death engagement and cell survival upon caspase activation. The existence of a caspase activity threshold was generally considered to underpin this binary decision, but this was never assessed quantitatively in vivo especially at the single cell level. Using quantitative live imaging combined with machine learning and optogenetics in the Drosophila pupal notum (a single layer epithelium), we reveal for the first time the existence of a large heterogeneity of caspase sensitivity between cells, as well as the existence of distinct spatial domains with low or high sensitivity to caspases. Using correlative and perturbative experiments, we outline the central role of past exposure to sublethal caspase activity which sensitises cells for apoptosis for several hours. Integrating information about past caspase activation is sufficient to explain most of the global pattern of caspase sensitivity and predict at the single cell level which cells will engage in apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that past sublethal caspase activation in a subset of cells is sufficient to bias cell elimination at the clonal and single cell level, thus revealing an alternative mechanism of physiological cell competition. Altogether, this work reveals for the first time the existence of a new layer of apoptosis regulation in vivo downstream of effector caspases which can be developmentally regulated and bias clonal selection and the spatial pattern of cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

For example, people tend to remember items as occurring farther apart in time if they spanned a change in context, or  event boundary, compared to the same context. While these distortions can sacrifice precise timing, they may serve to help separate temporally adjacent memories. However, the neural bases of this phenomenon are poorly understood. Here, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 32) with eye-tracking (n = 28) to test whether the dopaminergic system, known to influence encoding and time perception, predicts time dilation between adjacent events in memory. Participants encoded item sequences while listening to tones that mostly repeated over time, forming a stable auditory context, but occasionally switched, creating an event boundary. We found that boundaries predicted greater retrospective estimates of time between item pairs. Critically, tone switches significantly activated the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key midbrain dopaminergic region, and these responses in turn predicted greater time dilation between item pairs spanning those switches. Boundaries furthermore predicted a momentary increase in blinks. VTA activation also predicted blinking in general, consistent with the idea that blink behavior is a potential marker of dopaminergic activity. On a larger timescale, higher blink rates predicted greater time dilation in memory, but only for boundary-spanning pairs. Together, these findings suggest that dopaminergic processes are sensitive to event structure and may drive temporal distortions that help disjoin memories of distinct events.

SignificanceMeaningful changes in the environment can exaggerate the remembered time between experiences, suggesting a link between temporal distortions and the creation of distinct episodic memories. Here, we combined fMRI and eye-tracking with a paradigm that assessed temporal memory for item pairs encountered within and across task-relevant contexts. We found that contextual changes predicted activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and momentary increases in blinking, both potential markers of dopaminergic activity. VTA activation and more prolonged periods of blinking across boundaries were also associated with greater time dilation in memory. Our findings extend the relationship between dopamine and time perception to episodic memory, revealing how the ebb and flow of experience might bend memories of time to represent discrete events.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Genetic effects on personality are highly consistent across geography, reporter (self vs. close other), age group, and measurement instrument, and we find minimal spousal assortment for personality in recent history. In stark contrast to many other social and behavioral traits, within-family GWAS and polygenic index analyses indicate little to no shared environmental confounding in genetic associations with personality. Polygenic prediction, genetic correlation, and Mendelian randomization analyses indicate that personality genetics have widespread, potentially causal associations with a wide range of consequential behaviors and life outcomes.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in drug discovery, but existing models often fail to propose compounds that are both effective and synthetically tractable. To address these challenges, we introduce SyntheMol-RL, a reinforcement learning-based generative model that can rapidly design synthetically accessible small molecule drug candidates from a massive chemical space of 46 billion compounds. SyntheMol-RL improves upon our prior Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based SyntheMol model by generalizing across chemically similar building blocks and enabling multi-parameter optimization. We applied SyntheMol-RL to generate candidate antibiotics against S. aureus by optimizing for both antibacterial activity and aqueous solubility, and we found that SyntheMol-RL generated molecules with improved predicted properties compared to both the previous MCTS version of SyntheMol as well as an AI-based virtual screening baseline. We synthesized 79 SyntheMol-RL compounds that were unique relative to the training dataset and found that 13 showed potent in vitro activity, of which seven were structurally novel after detailed literature searches. Furthermore, one hit compound, synthecin, demonstrated efficacy in a murine wound infection model of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These results validate SyntheMol-RLs ability to generate novel and synthetically accessible candidate antibiotics and position SyntheMol-RL as a powerful tool for drug design across therapeutic domains.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

This question has been challenged by the observation of emergent coexistence, where microbial communities contain species that cannot coexist in pairs, suggesting the presence of non-pairwise mechanisms. Instead, we show that emergent coexistence arises naturally in species-rich models with pairwise interactions. Strikingly, this phenomenon does not require additional mechanisms like intransitive or higher-order interactions; rather, coexistence arises from dense networks of indirect effects. As diversity increases, we show that indirect effects become so intricate that pairwise interactions no longer predict community composition, revealing a fundamental limit to reductionist explanations of coexistence. Like chaos emerging from simple rules, our findings provide theoretical foundations to understand how unexpected species coexistence can emerge from pairwise interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Using calcium imaging in behaving flies, we find that a hair plate on the fly coxa (CxHP8) detects the limits of anterior leg movement. Reconstructing CxHP8 axons in the connectome, we found that they are wired to excite posterior leg movement and inhibit anterior leg movement. Consistent with this connectivity, optogenetic activation of CxHP8 neurons elicited posterior postural reflexes, while silencing altered the swing-to-stance transition during walking. Finally, we use comprehensive reconstruction of peripheral morphology and downstream connectivity to predict the function of other hair plates distributed across the fly leg. Our results suggest that each hair plate is specialized to control specific sensorimotor reflexes that are matched to the joint limit it detects. They also illustrate the feasibility of predicting sensorimotor reflexes from a connectome with identified proprioceptive inputs and motor outputs.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Among the available methods, enzymatic post-translational modification of short protein tags offers precision, stability, and modularity. However, broader application is often limited by complex substrate syntheses, the requirement of long or rigid recognition tags, and limited reaction efficiencies. Here, we present ADDing, a straightforward enzymatic method for functionalizing proteins with click chemistry handles using the flavin transferase ApbE. We discovered that, given a dedicated adenine diphosphate derivative (ADD) substrate, the enzyme attaches a phosphoribosyl moiety bearing bioorthogonal handles to proteins featuring a DxxxGAT amino acid motif. As the substrates can easily be enzymatically synthesized from NAD and inexpensive precursors, ADDing click handles can be performed in a streamlined, one-pot workflow combining substrate synthesis and protein conjugation. ADDing allows rapid, high-yield functionalization of proteins featuring the recognition tag at either terminus or internal loops and is compatible with copper and copper free azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we performed a wide variety of protein functionalizations, including fluorescent labeling, protein-protein, protein-DNA conjugation, and protein immobilization. This versatile technology thus holds great potential for chemical biology and the production of biological therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

The building of an asymmetric molecular model into density obtained by 11-fold symmetry averaging is inherently self-contradictory. This contradiction alone calls the validity of the derived structure into question. Our own data revealed that the complex primarily adopts an asymmetric open conformation in situ.

However, despite dozens of tools to identify signatures in cancer samples, there is not an established metric for statistically comparing mutational signature results and quantifying the overall significance of differences among complex mixtures of signatures. To close this methodological gap, we demonstrate that a signature-agnostic metric for measuring differences in mutation spectra - the aggregate mutation spectrum distance permutation method (AMSD) - can discover differences overlooked by signature analysis. First, we reanalyzed a study of carcinogen exposure in mice, identifying statistically significant shifts in mutation spectra caused by eleven of twenty tested carcinogens. Only three carcinogens were previously reported to induce distinct mutation signatures, suggesting that many carcinogens perturb mutagenesis by altering the composition of endogenous signatures rather than introducing unique signatures. Next, we used human tumor data to determine whether patient ancestry has a measurable impact on tumor mutation spectra, finding significant ancestry-associated differences across ten cancer types: for example, Africans have elevated SBS4 in lung adenocarcinomas, East Asians have elevated SBS16 in esophageal and liver cancers plus elevated SBS10a/b in uterine and colorectal cancers, and Europeans have elevated SBS17b in esophageal cancers plus elevated SBS2/13 in bladder cancers. These examples suggest that AMSD is a robust tool for detecting differences among tumor mutation spectra, complementing signature-based approaches and enabling the discovery of environmental and genetic influences on mutagenesis in large datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

As deforming membranes is energetically costly, biology has developed various protein systems to accomplish this task. The mechanisms providing the force to deform bacterial membranes to initiate division remain unknown. In vivo studies have shown the condensation of FtsZ filaments into a sharp ring is required to initiate cell division, an observation mirrored in vitro with FtsZ filaments encapsulated inside liposomes. Similarly, the force for membrane deformation in many eukaryotic deforming systems arises from the local crowding of proteins on the membrane surface. As any membrane deforming system works against the membrane tension, here we modulated the amount of lipid synthesis and thus membrane tension in Bacillus subtilis to examine: 1) if the condensation of FtsZ filaments by FtsZ bundling proteins serves to overcome the cellular membrane tension to deform the membrane inward and 2) how changes to the membrane tension affect the subsequent invagination of the septum. First, we developed methods to simultaneously measure and modulate membrane tension in live cells. Next, we determined how altering the membrane tension affected the cells ability to initiate division with reduced levels of FtsZ bundling proteins. While cells depleted of 2 FtsZ bundling proteins were unable to divide, reducing membrane tension to a given threshold restored their ability to initiate division. Likewise, cells with intermediate levels of FtsZ bundling proteins required a lesser decrease in membrane tension to initiate division. We also found that reductions in membrane tension increase the rate of Z ring constriction, with the constriction rate scaling linearly with the membrane tension. Interestingly, while the constriction rate in wild-type B. subtilis is limited by FtsZ treadmilling, the rate of constriction becomes independent of FtsZs treadmilling rate when membrane tension is reduced. These experiments give two major insights: First, the filament condensation caused by FtsZ bundling proteins works to overcome membrane tension and deform the membrane inward to initiate division. Second, the rate of septal constriction is limited by membrane tension, suggesting that membrane fluctuations at the tip of the growing septa limit the rate of cell wall synthesis. Finally, our measurements allow the estimation of several physical values of cell division, such as the force required to bend the membrane, but also that the cell membrane provides only 0.1%, a small amount of surface tension relative to the entire cell envelope, indicating 99.9% of the pressure drop occurs across the cell wall. These calculations also indicate that cell division occurs via comparatively very small membrane tension fluctuations relative to the high turgor pressure that exists across the entire cell envelope.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Using a combination of AlphaFold-guided modeling, rational design, and ThermoMPNN-informed optimization, we engineered a stabilized prefusion gB variant, D2C3. This construct incorporates two inter-protomeric disulfide bonds and three cavity-filling substitutions, resulting in a melting temperature of 54 {degrees}C. Cryo-EM analysis of this construct allowed us to determine the prefusion structure of EBV gB, providing insights into the structural transitions required to adopt the postfusion conformation. Murine immunizations and depletion studies with human sera suggested a trend toward improved functional immunogenicity of D2C3 compared to postfusion gB. Collectively, these studies define engineering principles to stabilize class III fusion proteins, provide reagents to interrogate the human antibody response to EBV gB, and lay a foundation for further studies to develop EBV gB-based vaccine candidates.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1747865363189

We identified common and species-specific adaptations to the different lighting conditions. Across species, dim light enhanced the speed and vigor of escape responses to predator-like looming stimuli. However, species diverged in their reactions to non-threatening stimuli, with Mus musculus and Peromyscus polionotus increasing aversive behaviors under dim light, while Peromyscus maniculatus showed stronger avoidance under bright conditions. Finally, although ambient light levels had a common effect on exploratory behavior, these changes were not predictive of subsequent visually evoked behaviors. Our findings reveal that ambient lighting profoundly and differentially shapes innate behavioral strategies across species, and demonstrate that these context-specific survival responses are inherited rather than learned.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

One of the most common forms is waste-product cross-feeding, a unidirectional interaction in which the waste products of one microbe support the growth of another. Despite its ubiquity, it is not well-understood why waste-product cross-feeding persists when a single organism could in principle perform both the producer and consumer role. To address this question, we first analyze cross-feeding evolution in a minimal model of microbial metabolism. The model describes multi-step extraction of energy from a substrate in a simple but thermodynamically correct formulation. Surprisingly, we find that cross-feeding is never evolutionarily stable in this model. By analyzing models with more complex growth functions, we identify a novel mechanism for the evolutionary stability of waste-product cross-feeding, namely, generalized intracellular metabolite toxicity. Such toxicity arises because, in excess, the same intracellular metabolites that cells require for metabolism can be detrimental to growth (e.g., due to osmotic stress). We show that some but not all forms of such toxicity can lead to evolutionarily stable consortia of microbes that cross-feed waste products. This stability results from the potential of such consortia to divide the burden of toxic metabolites among a larger population, allowing them to perform their collective metabolism more efficiently than non-cross-feeders. More generally, we predict that growth penalties that scale nonlinearly with intracellular metabolite levels promote cross-feeding. We find that this mechanism for cross-feeding evolutionary stability implies nontrivial population dynamics, such as a discontinuity in population biomass at the onset of cross-feeding.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

Key MessagesA Key Messages section should be added after the keywords and before the articles introduction, with the key messages of the paper made in 3 bullet points that succinctly describe:

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

Since plant cells are encased in cell walls and thus immotile, their individual fate-specification program is dependent on their relative position within the organism. It is assumed that the cell wall and its mechanical properties are under surveillance, linking cell wall state to intracellular gene-regulatory networks. However, the role of these cell wall signalling pathways in plant development and the contribution of cell wall properties to cell behaviour and identity are unclear. Here, we show that control of cell wall properties is essential for the perpetuation of stem cell populations and pattering in the shoot apical meristems. The expression of pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which modify homogalacturonan methylesterification and thereby modulate cell wall mechanics, is maintained at low levels in stem cells by the stem cell specifying transcription factor WUS. Low PME expression is required for stemness, auxin patterning and stem cell-specific mechanical properties. Conversely, WUS depletion reduces wall stiffness in the meristem centre, reinforcing its role in maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Together, our findings show that WUS-mediated control of cell wall-modifying enzymes is essential for sustaining stem cell identity and SAM organization. These results demonstrat that the plant cell wall is not only involved in cell differentiation, but also exerts feedback control on developmental transitions, contributing to our understanding how the immediate physical environment is able to guide cell fate decisions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

While not traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder, recent ex-vivo studies have shown elevated levels of misfolded tau protein in TLE. This study investigated tau deposition in TLE patients using the in-vivo PET tracer [18F]MK-6240. 18 TLE patients and 20 healthy controls underwent PET imaging, with data analyzed to assess tau uptake and its relationship with brain connectivity, clinical variables, and cognitive function. Compared to controls, TLE patients exhibited markedly increased [18F]MK-6240 uptake in bilateral superior and medial temporal regions and the parietal cortex, with tau accumulation following regional functional and structural connectivity, disease duration, and cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that tau accumulation may contribute to the progression of TLE and cognitive decline, supporting a potential role of tau in epilepsy-related neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Here, we focus on nitrogen (N2) fixation, one of life s most critical and ancient metabolisms, to investigate the drivers of complexity in its associated genetic network. We used a large-scale comparative genomics framework to construct a comprehensive catalog of today s N2 fixation-associated genes and assessed their distribution across diverse microbial genomes and environmental backgrounds. Genomes enriched in N2 fixation genes generally have larger genome sizes, broader metabolic capabilities, wider habitat ranges, and are predominantly associated with mesophilic and aerobic lifestyles. Evolutionary reconstructions reveal a pattern of early gene gains in ancestral diazotrophs followed by lineage specific gene losses in later diverging taxa, suggesting evolutionary trade-offs shaped by changing environments. These findings demonstrate that the evolution of N2 fixation has been intertwined with the restructuring of its genetic network, driven by feedbacks between microbial evolution and changing environmental and ecological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

We consider the approximate version of this problem, that is, the result set is allowed to contain some false positive matches (but no false negatives), and focus on the specific case where the indexed documents are DNA strings. In this setting, state-of-the-art solutions rely on Bloom filters as a way to index all k-mers (substrings of length k) in the documents. To answer a query, the k-mers of the query string are tested for membership against the index and documents that contain at least a user-prescribed fraction of them (e.g., 75-80%) are returned. Methods and results: Here, we explore an alternative index design based on k-mer minimizers and integer compression methods. We show that a careful implementation of this design outperforms previous solutions based on Bloom filters by a wide margin: the index has lower memory footprint and faster query times, while false positive matches have only a minor impact on the ranking of the documents reported. This trend is robust across genomic datasets of different complexity and query workloads.

This process has been interpreted as a form of active sensing and is associated with faster responses and improved perceptual accuracy. While converging evidence suggests that respiration also shapes interoceptive processing at both neural and behavioural levels, it remains unclear whether individuals actively adjust their breathing to optimize interoceptive performance. In this study, we examined whether healthy participants modulated their respiration during an interoceptive (heartbeat discrimination) and an exteroceptive (tactile detection) task. We analysed respiration both in terms of time-locked activity and inter-trial phase coherence relative to stimulus onset and assessed their relationship with perceptual accuracy. Our results demonstrated that participants systematically adjust their breathing in both amplitude and phase, synchronizing respiration to the anticipated (i.e., cued) onset of stimuli in both tasks. Crucially, task performance was enhanced during exhalation compared to inhalation, suggesting that respiratory modulation supports the perception of both interoceptive and exteroceptive signals.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.

This is typically done by generating an assembly from the sequencing reads of a bacterial isolate and running AMR gene detection tools on the assembly. However, despite advances in long-read sequencing that have greatly improved the quality and completeness of bacterial genome assemblies, assembly tools remain prone to large-scale errors caused by repeats in the genome, leading to inaccurate detection of AMR gene content and consequent impact on resistance prediction. In this work we present Amira, a tool to detect AMR genes directly from unassembled long-read sequencing data. Amira leverages the fact that multiple consecutive genes lie within a single read to construct gene-space de Bruijn graphs where the k-mer alphabet is the set of genes in the pan-genome of the species under study. Through this approach, the reads corresponding to different copies of AMR genes can be effectively separated based on the genomic context of the AMR genes, and used to infer the nucleotide sequence of each copy. Amira achieves significant improvements in genomic copy number recall and nucleotide accuracy, demonstrated through objective simulations and comparison with alternative read and assembly-based methods on samples with manually curated truth assemblies. Applied to a dataset of 32 Escherichia coli samples with diverse AMR gene content, Amira achieves a mean genomic-copy-number recall of 98.4% with precision 97.9% and nucleotide accuracy 99.9%.

In extreme cases, like for photosynthetic organisms, their energy source, light, can fluctuate dramatically in intensity over timescales of seconds to hours. While various photosynthetic electron flows (EF) are crucial for maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis, how EFs are modulated to respond to dynamic energy intake remains unclear. Here, we show in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that each EF is best suited to a specific domain of energetic fluctuation periodicity for which it can support the cells energetic needs, which we term bandwidth. By systematically exposing cells to a range of light periodicities, we show that while cyclic EF has a large bandwidth, pseudo-cyclic EF (PCEF) can only sustain the cells energetic needs for fast light fluctuations, and that the interplay between the chloroplast and the mitochondria (CMEF) has a limited bandwidth. We further show that the bandwidths of PCEF and CMEF, specialized for dynamic lights, are related to their capacity to generate ATP and protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Finally, we show that in wild-type cells, the activity level of PCEF and CMEF matches their bandwidth, and we propose that cells tune the relative activity of each AEF depending on the light fluctuation frequency. Our work opens an avenue of research to characterize the molecular mechanisms required for phototrophic growth in complex and dynamic energetic landscapes. It further provides a generalizable framework for understanding the physiological importance of molecular mechanisms in a dynamic environment.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

However, lacking conserved residues in disordered region of condensate proteins hampers alignment-based analyses of their evolutionary trajectory. To gain a comprehensive overview of phase-separating protein evolution across the Tree of Life, we analyzed phase-separating proteins of proteomes from 1,106 species. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes showed high contrast in need for phase-separating proteins and with a clear genome size-dependent correlation. Evolutionary success appears to hinge on the balance between functional condensation and avoiding harmful aggregation-prone biophysical signatures, such as certain amino acid homorepeats embedded in molecular grammar. We also identified potential phase separation-regulated signaling hubs across kingdoms by integrating phase-separation-positive proteins with protein abundance and interactome data across four model eukaryotic species. Consequently, we created PhaseHub (https://phasehub.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/), a user-friendly interface that explores key scaffold proteins and binders to pinpoint associated partners and potential multicomponent phase separation hubs.

Here, we investigate which level of brain organization - regions, networks, or validated whole-brain machine-learning signatures - best explains negative affective traits in a community sample of 458 adults performing the two most widely used affective fMRI tasks, viewing emotional faces and scenes. Neuroticism could not be predicted from brain activity, with Bayesian evidence against all theory-guided neural measures. However, preregistered whole-brain models successfully decoded vulnerability to stress, a lower-level facet of neuroticism, with results replicating in a hold-out sample. The neural stress vulnerability pattern demonstrated good psychometric properties and indicated that negative affective traits are best represented by distributed whole-brain patterns related to domain-general stimulation rather than localized activity. Together with results from a comprehensive multiverse analysis across 14 traits and 1,176 models - available for exploration in an online app - the findings speak against simplistic neurobiological theories of negative affective traits, highlight a striking gap between predicting individual differences (r<.35) and within-person emotional states (r=.88), and underscore the importance of aligning psychological constructs with neural measures at the appropriate level of granularity.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

To highlight its scalability, we use IGUA to cluster >2.8 million BGCs from {approx}1 million prokaryotic genomes in <18 hours (n = 2,829,071 BGCs to 56,960 GCFs). To showcase its utility beyond BGC clustering, we use IGUA to cluster (i) secretion systems and (ii) prophages into GCFs (n = 10,576 and 356,776 gene clusters to 2,744 and 213,699 GCFs, respectively).

In this study, we systematically map degrons in all 1,626 human transcription factors. We find thousands of both known and previously unidentified degrons and characterize their sequence properties. Degrons placed within exposed and intrinsically disordered regions regulate the cellular abundance of the transcription factors, while the most common somatic mutations that are linked to skin cutaneous melanoma lead to unfolding and exposure of a buried degron in zinc fingers. We present examples of compartment specific degrons and demonstrate that variant effects in transcription factors correlate with degron potency. Finally, we show that while >60% of all predicted transcriptional activation domains overlap with strong degrons, acidic residues within the remaining transactivating regions counter the degron potency.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

We introduce BehaveAgent, an autonomous multimodal AI agent designed to automate behavior analysis from video input without retraining or manual intervention. Unlike conventional methods that require manual behavior annotation, video segmentation, task-specific model training, BehaveAgent leverages the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLM) to generalize across novel behavioral domains without need for additional training. It integrates LLMs, vision-language models (VLMs), and large-scale visual grounding modules, orchestrated through a multimodal context memory and goal-directed attention mechanism, to enable robust zero-shot visual reasoning across species and experimental paradigms, including plants, insects, rodents, primates, and humans. Upon receiving a video input, BehaveAgent autonomously identifies the correct analysis strategy and performs end-to-end behavior analysis and interpretation without human supervision. Leveraging vision-language representations, it performs general-purpose tracking, pose estimation and segmentation. We demonstrate BehaveAgent's universal applicability to autonomously (1) identify the behavioral paradigm and develop an action plan specialized for the identified paradigm, (2) identify relevant subjects and objects, (3) track those features, (4) identify behavioral sequences with explicit reasoning, (5) generate and execute code for targeted analysis and (6) generate comprehensive research reports that integrate behavioral findings with relevant scientific literature. Through interpretable agentic reasoning, BehaveAgent makes its internal decision-making process transparent, clarifying why particular features are tracked or behaviors inferred. By reducing the time and expertise required for behavior analysis, BehaveAgent introduces a scalable, generalizable, and explainable paradigm for advancing biological and behavioral research.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Pi-Cer D is cleaved by the plant extracellular ceramidase NEUTRAL CERAMIDASE 2 (NCER2), and the resulting 9-methyl-branched sphingoid base is recognized by the plant receptor RESISTANT TO DFPM-INHIBITION OF ABSCISIC ACID SIGNALING 2 (RDA2) at the plasma membrane to transduce a defense signal.

Here we introduce this frame-work by deriving metrics that quantify the minimum, typical, and maximum amplification of perturbed abundances under nonequilibrium population dynamics. By simulating models under several nonequilibrium scenarios, we demonstrate that these metrics accurately characterize the full range of amplification of perturbed abundances in the short and long terms. Notably, we show that perturbation amplification depends strongly on community state in the short term, but this state dependency vanishes in the long term. Overall, our framework enables stability analysis for model and natural communities that do not exhibit equilibrium dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

It is presently not well understood whether the fever response to IAV infection impacts subsequent viral replication and innate immune activation. Here we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased mvRNA synthesis and antiviral signaling. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production underlies the increased mvRNA level. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever during IAV infection can establish a positive feedback loop in which elevated aberrant RNA synthesis and innate immune activation may contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine production.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Recent studies which separate oscillatory and aperiodic components of electrophysiological power spectra have highlighted a relationship between aperiodic activity and functional brain states. Studies in both animal models and humans suggest that the aperiodic slope of electrophysiological power spectra reflects the local balance of excitatory:inhibitory (E:I) synaptic transmission. Aperiodic slope varies across individuals, brain states, and clinical populations, which may reflect important differences in E:I balance. However, there is currently a lack of evidence linking aperiodic slope to other measures of excitation and inhibition in the human brain. Here, we show that flatter (less steep) aperiodic slopes from human electroencephalography (EEG) are associated with higher concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate measured with 7 tesla magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the occipital lobe at rest. This suggests that individual differences in aperiodic neural activity reflect cortical glutamate concentrations, providing important insight for understanding changes in neural excitation across brain states and neuropsychiatric populations (e.g., schizophrenia) where glutamatergic function may differ. Our results support the use of aperiodic slope as a non-invasive marker for excitatory tone in the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Here, we identified E4BP4 as a transcriptional repressor that prevents obesity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and oxidative dysfunction by inhibiting ceramide synthesis in brown fat. Specifically, E4BP4 interacts with PRDM16 to repress Cers6 mRNA expression and consequently reduces C16:0 ceramide levels by binding to a 65 kb upstream enhancer region of the Cers6 gene.

STX17 modification induces recruitment of STX17+ membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to Legionella-containing phagosomes to form replicative vacuoles.

Mass spectrometric identification of PR-Ub sites and mutational studies show that PR-Ub modification of STX17 alters its interaction with ATG14L, which drives the recruitment of ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole in a PI3K dependent manner. On the other hand, PR-Ub of SNAP29 inhibits the formation of the autophagosomal SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by steric hindrance, thereby preventing the fusion of bacterial vacuoles with lysosomes.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Middle-aged individuals exhibited shorter sleep durations during the week, with weekend sleep increasing by as much as 50 min.

We previously provided evidence that loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection promotes activation of host antiviral immunity via a mechanism involving derepression of EREs and production of immunostimulatory RNAs. While the IAV NS1 protein might limit consequences of such activation via its dsRNA-binding activity, we hypothesized that other human pathogenic viruses could have evolved more direct strategies to counteract this potential ERE-based defense system. Here, we reveal that V proteins from diverse paramyxoviruses, including Measles, Mumps, Parainfluenza, and Nipah/Hendra viruses, can all engage with TRIM28. Notably, the efficiency of engagement varies markedly between virus species, a phenotype that can be linked to specific residues within the C-terminal domain of V proteins. Further mapping showed that V proteins target both the TRIM28 Coiled-Coil domain and the TRIM28 PHD-Bromodomain, which contains the functionally-relevant TRIM28 SUMO-modification sites necessary for ERE repression. In this context, while paramyxovirus infection triggers canonical stress-associated phosphorylation of TRIM28, loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 does not occur, and minimal induction of the TRIM28-dependent ERE RNA, HERVK14C, is observed. Furthermore, pre-infection with Parainfluenza virus type 2, which encodes a V protein that efficiently engages with TRIM28, limits subsequent IAV-triggered loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and upregulation of HERVK14C RNA. These findings dissect the interplay between paramyxoviruses and TRIM28, providing support for the concept of a TRIM28-regulated ERE-based antiviral defense system by uncovering a potential viral antagonistic measure.

ImportanceHost recognition of viral nucleic acids is fundamental for stimulating antiviral immunity. To prevent aberrant immune activation, cells must precisely differentiate ""non-self"" from ""self"" nucleic acids. Endogenous retroelements (EREs), despite their self-origin, can produce immunostimulatory RNAs that blur this distinction, and may have been functionally co-opted to enhance antiviral immunity in response to some infections. Normally, ERE transcription is repressed by the host protein TRIM28, the function of which is dynamically modulated by SUMO-modification. Here, we demonstrate that paramyxoviruses engage TRIM28, maintaining it in its repressive, SUMO-modified form during infection. We propose that this virus-host interaction limits ERE activation and consequently suppresses ERE-driven immune signaling, revealing a previously unidentified mechanism of immune evasion by paramyxoviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Existing state-of-the-art models for both modeling and designing protein-DNA interactions primarily rely on structural information, facing limitations in scalability and efficiency for large-scale applications. Notable methods like AlphaFold 3 and RosettaTTAFold All-Atom exist, but they are inefficient and inherently struggle at modeling conformationally unstable proteins, such as transcription factors, which arguably represent the most important class of DNA-binding proteins. Here, we present DPAC (DNA-Protein binding Alignment via Contrastive learning), which leverages pre-trained protein and DNA language models via a contrastive loss to align the two modalities in a high-dimensional shared latent space. DPAC not only significantly accelerates the design process compared to current structure-based methods but also demonstrates a strong ability to differentiate real binders from non-binders. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.591 on a low identity set, outperforming state-of-the-art structure-based methods. Additionally, DPAC integrates simulated annealing for the design of new protein sequences with optimized DNA binding affinity, successfully recovering binding affinity in engineered sequences by up to 20% in in silico tests. Our results highlight DPAC's potential for facilitating the design and discovery of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, paving the way for advancements in genomic research and biotechnology applications.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

This process usually takes about one year. In the Neotropical lekking manakins (Pipridae), males of most species exhibit delayed plumage maturation (DPM), passing through drab predefinitive plumages for two or three years before reaching a bright, sexually dimorphic, definitive plumage. We used a phylogenetic analysis to investigate the evolutionary history of DPM in manakins. Our unique comparative dataset derived characters from a graph structure representing the developmental schedules of individual, colorful plumage patches. We traced the origin of one-year DPM to the ancestor of sexually dichromatic Piprinae manakins, followed by three separate origins of prolonged, two-year DPM, plus one subsequent extension to three-year DPM. Consistent with social signaling hypotheses, prolonged DPM evolved to reveal and maintain signals of young male status. This interspecific pattern sheds light on the sociosexual development of lekking birds, a topic usually restricted to autecological field studies. By detailing heterochronic dynamics in manakin plumage evolution, we also show how the iterative regeneration of characters like bird feathers, insect instars, mammalian antlers, and angiosperm flowers can create multiple distinct levels of developmental homologies among bodies, sexes, and species.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1747865363189

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747865363189

We took advantage of high-density Neuropixels electrodes to record large populations of neurons across layers of macaque V1 and used a state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality reduction approach on waveform shape to delineate nine putative cell classes, 4 narrow-spiking (NS), 4 broad-spiking (BS) and 1 tri-phasic (TP). Then, we performed targeted analyses of laminar organization, spike amplitude, multichannel spatial features, functional properties, and network connectivity of these cell classes, to discover four fundamental aspects of the V1 microcircuit predicted by anatomical studies, but never fully demonstrated before in vivo: First, NS neurons were most concentrated in layer 4 and more numerous than parvalbumin positive neurons, consistent with studies of potassium channel expression in excitatory neurons in V1. Second, a large amplitude NS cell class in layer 4B was strongly direction selective, with multichannel waveforms consistent with a stellate morphology, which is a likely functional correlate of anatomical descriptions of neurons that project between V1 and MT. Third, an NS cell class in layer 4B showed robust bursting activity and strong orientation selectivity. Finally, cross-correlation analysis of neuron pairs revealed distinct functional interactions between cell classes. These results demonstrate that high-resolution electrophysiology enables discovery of novel relationships between structural organization and in vivo functional responses of neurons, and can inform biologically realistic microcircuit models of primate V1, perhaps even extending to all of neocortex.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Yet how they estimate the distance to an odour source remains unclear. The spatiotemporal dynamics of natural odour plumes, shaped by airflow turbulence, offer valuable cues for locating odour sources. Here, we show that mice can discriminate odour sources placed at different distances by extracting information from the sub-sniff temporal structure of naturalistic odour plumes. Using a wind tunnel and an olfactory virtual reality system, we generated dynamic plumes and demonstrated, through high-throughput automated behaviour, that mice distinguish near from far sources based on odour fluctuations operating faster than their respiratory cycle. Two-photon calcium imaging of olfactory bulb projection neurons revealed that distance-dependent responses are present in a small subset of mitral and tufted cells, and that population activity encodes source distance. Critically, neural responses correlated more strongly with high-frequency plume features than with mean odour concentration. Our results identify a neural basis for distance estimation from odour dynamics and highlight the importance of rapid temporal processing in mammalian olfaction.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

This mutation-selection-drift-balance (MSDB) shapes the prevalence of a disease and its genetic architecture. To date, however, MSDB has only been modeled for monogenic (Mendelian) diseases. Here, we develop a MSDB model for complex disease susceptibility: we assume that genotype relates to disease risk according to the canonical liability threshold model and that selection on variants affecting risk derives from the fitness cost of the disease, and focus on diseases that are highly polygenic, entail a substantial fitness cost, and are neither extremely common in the population nor exceedingly rare. Contrasting model predictions with GWAS and other findings in humans suggests that directional selection plays little role in shaping common genetic variation affecting complex disease susceptibility but might substantially affect rare, large effect variation. In turn, common variation affecting complex disease susceptibility appears to be dominated by pleiotropic stabilizing selection on other traits. Our results further suggest that current estimates of disease heritability are likely biased. More generally, our model provides a better understanding of the evolutionary processes that shape the architecture and prevalence of complex diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

In Arabidopsis, the RNA-binding protein RBP47b is a canonical SG marker, yet its functional contribution to thermotolerance remains unresolved. Here, we combined mTurboID proximity labeling with multi-omics profiling to define the RBP47b interactome and its physiological impact. mTurboID identified a stress-specific enrichment of 40S ribosomal subunits within RBP47b SGs, implicating these condensates in translational control. Surprisingly, quadruple mutant plants lacking all four RBP47 paralogues (rbp47abcc') displayed enhanced survival, attenuated growth delay, and faster recovery of photosynthetic efficiency after severe heat stress. Integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses revealed that this gain of thermotolerance is associated with (i) accelerated re-initiation of translation, (ii) constitutively elevated jasmonate and oxylipin pools, and (iii) reduced ROS accumulation during heat and recovery. We conclude that the RBP47 family acts as a negative regulator of heat tolerance by sequestering 40S subunits and limiting translational restart; loss of these SG scaffolds pre-primes jasmonate-dependent detoxification pathways and expedites proteome rebuilding, thereby conferring superior thermotolerance.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

To address this, we mapped chromatin accessibility in corticospinal neurons across postnatal development and found two distinct waves of restriction--an early, partial closure between P0-P4, followed by a stronger, more widespread restriction from P7 into adulthood. We also asked whether the distance of injury influences chromatin remodeling and found that distal (thoracic) injuries triggered only modest changes, while proximal (intracortical) injuries led to much broader accessibility shifts, pointing to injury proximity as a key factor in epigenetic responsiveness. We then tested whether this restricted chromatin could be reopened by introducing PATZ1, a transcription factor normally expressed during early postnatal growth. AAV-based delivery of PATZ1 after injury caused marked chromatin remodeling, including an 11.6-fold increase in H3K27ac at growth-relevant sites and large-scale reorganization of 3D genome structure, with compartment shifts toward active states and altered TAD boundaries. These changes were accompanied by reactivation of gene networks linked to developmental growth. Our results help define when and how chromatin becomes restrictive in CNS neurons and show that it can be reopened using targeted interventions like PATZ1 to support regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Preserving locomotive capacity was likely essential for survival during the human hunter-gatherer period but surprisingly little is known about the molecular effects of energy deficit on human skeletal muscle, which is a key tissue for locomotion and metabolic health. Here we show that a 5-day 78% reduction in energy availability with concomitant aerobic exercise in healthy men leads to a profound modulation of skeletal muscle phenotype alongside increases in fat oxidation at rest and during exercise and a 2.1 {+/-} 0.8 kg loss of fat free mass and 0.8 {+/-} 0.6 kg of fat mass. We used stable isotope (D2O) labelling and peptide mass spectrometry to investigate the abundance and turnover rates of individual proteins. Abundance (1469 proteins) and synthesis rate (736 proteins) data discovered a shift toward a more oxidative phenotype and reorganisation of cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix structure during energy deficit. Mitochondrial components: TCA, electron transport chain and beta-oxidation, were prominently represented amongst proteins that increased in abundance and synthesis rate, as well as proteins related to mitochondrial proteostasis, remodelling and quality-control such as BDH1 and LONP1. Changes in muscle metabolic pathways occurred alongside a reduction in extracellular matrix proteins, which may counteract the age-related muscle fibrosis. Our results suggest that muscle metabolic pathways are not only preserved but positively affected during periods of concomitant low energy availability and exercise.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Here, we identify LPCAT3 as a cold-regulated O-acyltransferase driving the highly selective accrual of AA-PE in BAT mitochondria. Lipid-based proteomics, molecular dynamics simulations, and bioenergetic analyses reveal that AA-PE partitions at the COX4I1 interface of the Cytochrome c oxidase complex, enhancing electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency. Accordingly, fat-specific Lpcat3-knockout mice have defects in respiratory-dependent BAT thermogenesis and cold tolerance, despite intact {beta}-adrenergic signaling and UCP1 function. Under cold acclimation, Lpcat3-/-BAT exhibits ETC dysfunction and activation of the integrated stress-response. Thus, our study illuminates a cold-regulated lipid-protein interaction as a gating factor in UCP1-dependent thermogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Although the virus was discovered over sixty years ago and undergoes continuous antigenic drift, remarkably little is known about the humoral immune response to HCoV-229E infection. Here we report the isolation of two receptor binding domain-targeting neutralizing human antibodies raised in response to natural HCoV-229E infection. One of these, DH1533, potently neutralizes HCoV-229E, binds to spike with sub-nanomolar affinity and prevents the association between the RBD and the host cell receptor aminopeptidase N. Structural characterization of this antibody bound to HCoV-229E spike delineated a neutralization-sensitive epitope on the RBD and revealed that DH1533 induces conformational flexibility in neighboring RBDs, reminiscent of the ""up-and-down"" kinetics observed in the related Betacoronavirus spikes. These findings provide insight into the humoral immune response to HCoV-229E infection and will serve as a guide for the design of future therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

Proteins are often optimized for single functions during design and engineering, without considering the countless other functionalities that may contribute to or interfere with the intended outcome. In this work, we apply deep learning to understand and design the multifunctional host-targeting landscape of the T7 bacteriophage receptor binding protein for enhanced infectivity, pre-defined specificity, and high generality in virulence toward unseen strains. We compare several different model architectures and design approaches and experimentally characterize designed phages optimized for 26 diverse tasks. We demonstrate that with multiobjective machine learning, it is possible to design complex specificities at success rates that can enable low-throughput validation of predicted hits. Our results show that the targeting capabilities of T7 are highly plastic, with opposite specificities often separated by only a few mutations. This level of tunability underscores how models trained on multifunctional data can uncover key principles of phage biology and specificity. The same modeling framework can be applied to guide the multiobjective design of other proteins or mutable biological systems, offering a general strategy for navigating multifunctional landscapes.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

It is still debated if behavioural responses are mainly the result of phenotypic plasticity or if they were driven by anthropic selective pressures, especially in small populations. Our study focused on the Apennine brown bear population (Ursus arctos marsicanus), which has coexisted with humans in Central Italy for millennia. We characterised genomic diversity and identified adaptation signals distinctive to this population by comparing whole genome resequencing data across the Holarctic species range. We show that Apennine brown bears possess a unique genomic diversity pattern including selective signatures at genes associated with reduced aggressiveness, possibly involving alternative splicing mechanism. Our findings suggest that even in small and long-isolated populations, selection may shape behavioural traits. We hypothesise that human-induced selection has influenced these changes, reducing conflicts and contributing to the long-term persistence of the Apennine bear and its coexistence with humans.","NA","biorxiv",1747865363189

In this retrospective review, we evaluated the landscape of clinical trials (CTx) registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for the consideration of potential factors contributing to human heterogeneity in their design and analyses. Among CTx registered from 1995-2024, we observed a trend toward equality in including female participants, but lack of reporting of sex as a biological variable. Limited demographic diversity was observed with [~]93% White population participation. There was a substantial divergence in the diagnostic criteria and a wide range of tools employed to measure CC. Lastly, few studies considered cancer type and stage as clinical variables. Overall, a substantial gap remains in our knowledge of CC in non-white and female populations. Ultimately, these underreported data across CC CTx complicate the comparison and interpretation of CTx results, both within understudied populations and in specific cancer types. The current evolution of knowledge and new methodologies used for CC assessment reinforce the need for a constant revision of the CC consensus definition and diagnosis criteria to align with current advances in our understanding of human heterogeneity in CC.","NA","medrxiv",1747865363189

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.
