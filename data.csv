In this context, windborne transmission, the idea that the virus can travel through the air over considerable distances, is a contentious concept and, documented cases are rare. Here, though, we provide genetic evidence supporting the feasibility of windborne transmission. During the 2023-24 HPAI season, molecular surveillance identified identical H5N1 strains among a cluster of unrelated commercial farms about 8 km apart in the Czech Republic. The episode started with the abrupt mortality of fattening ducks on one farm and was followed by disease outbreaks at two nearby high-biosecurity chicken farms. Using genetic, epizootiological, meteorological and geographical data, we reconstructed a mosaic of events strongly suggesting wind was the mechanism of infection transmission between poultry in at least two independent cases. By aligning the genetic and meteorological data with critical outbreak events, we determined the most likely time window during which the transmission occurred and inferred the sequence of infected houses at the recipient sites. Our results suggest that the contaminated plume emitted from the infected fattening duck farm was the critical medium of HPAI transmission, rather than the dust generated during depopulation. Furthermore, they also strongly implicate the role of confined mechanically-ventilated buildings with high population densities in facilitating windborne transmission and propagating virus concentrations below the minimum infectious dose at the recipient sites. These findings underscore the importance of considering windborne spread in future outbreak mitigation strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

These can include blood pressure instability, hyperinflammation, coagulopathies, and neuropsychiatric complaints. The pathogenesis of these features remains unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) binds Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells to initiate infection. We hypothesized that some patients may produce anti-RBD antibodies that resemble ACE2 sufficiently to have ACE2-like catalytic activity, that is they are ACE2-like proteolytic abzymes that may help mediate the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and LC. In previous work, we showed that some acute COVID-19 patients had immunoglobulin-associated ACE2-like proteolytic activity, suggesting that some COVID-19 patients indeed produced ACE2-like abzymes. However, it remained unknown whether ACE2-like abzymes were seen only in acute COVID-19 patients or whether ACE2-like abzymes could also be identified in convalescent COVID-19 patients. Here we show that some convalescent COVID-19 patients attending a clinic for patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms also have ACE2-like abzymes and that the presence of ACE2-like catalytic activity correlates with alterations in blood pressure in an exercise test.","NA","medrxiv",1739570859423

Both neutralising activity and effector function activity of Spike-specific antibodies have been shown to be important for their protective and therapeutic activity. However, several recent studies have reported that vaccination with mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines can lead to elevated levels of Spike-specific IgG4, an isotype which is often considered anti-inflammatory due to its reduced binding to Fc{gamma} receptors on immune cells. Here we show that the level of Spike-specific IgG4 produced following BNT162b2 vaccination is impacted by the interval between and frequency of vaccines boosts, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (hybrid immunity), breakthrough infection and bivalent vaccine boosters. Despite the increase in Spike-specific IgG4 between the 2nd and 3rd BNT162b2 vaccine dose, neutralisation, ADCD and ADCP activity all increased. Through expression of SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies cloned as IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4, we demonstrated that whilst Spike-specific IgG4 had reduced effector function activity, including ADCC, ADCD and ADCP, IgG4 was only inhibitory when directly competing with functional IgG subclasses binding to an overlapping epitope. In the context of polyclonal plasma, ADCC and ADCD activity could not be depleted by addition of high concentrations of a Spike-specific IgG4 mAb cocktail suggesting the non-stimulatory effect of Spike-specific IgG4 may be hidden in more complex scenarios, such as polyclonal mixes in serum.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

How these clusters interact with genes and their impact on transcriptional activity remain heavily debated. Here we take advantage of the naturally occurring increase in transcriptional activity during Zygotic Genome Activation (ZGA) in Drosophila melanogaster embryos to characterize the functional roles of RNAPII clusters in a developmental context. Using single-molecule tracking and lattice light-sheet microscopy, we find that RNAPII cluster formation depends on transcription initiation and that cluster lifetimes are reduced upon transcription elongation. We show that single clusters are stably associated with active gene loci during transcription and that cluster intensities are strongly correlated with transcriptional output. Our data suggest that prior to ZGA, RNAPII clusters prime genes for activation, whereas after ZGA, clusters are composed mostly of elongating molecules at individual genes.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

We do this based on a series of piecemeal GWASs of segments of a target (continuous) trait distribution, and the genetic correlations between those GWASs and a second trait. Simulations confirm that we are able to retrieve the shape of the relationship given certain assumptions about the nature of the relationship between the traits. We applied the method to the genetic relationship between BMI, sleep duration, and height, and psychiatric disorders (ADHD, anorexia nervosa, and depression) using data from approximately 450K individuals from UK Biobank. In the relationship between BMI and psychiatric traits, we found that the expected value of depression is a nonlinear function of BMI i.e. there is a nonlinear genetic relationship between both traits. We observed similar findings for the genetic relationship between BMI and anorexia, sleep duration and depression, and sleep duration and ADHD. We observed no underlying nonlinearity in the genetic relationship between height and psychiatric traits. Using a novel statistical approach, we show that nonlinear genetic relationships between traits are detectable and genetic associations as quantified using global estimators like genetic correlations are not informative about underlying complexities in these relationships. Our findings challenge assumptions of linearity in genetic epidemiology and suggest that bivariate genetic associations are not uniform across the phenotypic spectrum, which may have implications for the development of targeted interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Residents of Sydney have reported increasing cases of bin-opening behavior by sulphur-crested cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), with evidence this behavior is socially learned between birds. Households protected their bins, yet cockatoos have learned to defeat these defences. In response, residents increase their defence-level, setting the stage for a behavioral ""arms race"". Here, we investigate this arms race by combining field observations with agent-based modeling. We systematically document protections in a suburban locality over two years, revealing spatial clustering of protections indicative of social learning among residents. We find that protections have decreased since 2019, and overly-costly protection is dis-preferred. With a controlled assay, we characterize the knowledge of local cockatoos, finding differential proficiency in defeating protections. Surprisingly, we identified several cockatoos that can defeat high-efficacy protections, such as locks. Finally, we simulate interactions between two populations of learning agents representing households and cockatoos. We find that social learning accelerates adaptation in both species, while coordination reduces costs associated with defensive escalation. However, policy interventions can have unintended consequences, accelerating cockatoos' skill acquisition and shifting conflict to neighboring areas. Our findings highlight the dynamic nature of human-wildlife conflict and the importance of considering behavioral feedback loops in urban wildlife management.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Although they share a common evolutionary origin with modern-day plants and display complex multicellular development, we still lack comprehensive genome data from the most highly-evolved groups of red algae. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of Bostrychia moritziana, a species that is classified into the Rhodomelaceae family of the Ceramiales order, both of which constitute the largest and most diverse family and order of red algae, respectively. Contrary to the commonly held view that red algae generally have small genomes, we report significant genome size expansion in Bostrychia and other Ceramiales species, which we posit as one of at least three independent genome expansion events that occurred during red algal evolution. Our analyses suggest that these expansions do not involve polyploidy or ancient whole genome duplications, but in the case of Bostrychia appear to be largely driven by the dramatic proliferation of a single lineage of giant Plavaka DNA transposons. Consistent with increased genome size, we identify a substantial increase in gene content in Bostrychia that was shaped both by de novo gene emergence and by the amplification of gene families in common with other Ceramiales seaweeds, providing key insight into the genetic adaptations underpinning the evolutionary success of this species-rich order. Finally, our sex-specific assemblies enabled us to resolve the UV sex chromosomes in Bostrychia, which feature expanded gene-rich sex-linked regions. Notably, these sex-linked regions each harbour a distinct TALE-HD transcription factor orthologous to ancient regulators of haploid-diploid transitions in other multicellular lineages. Together, our findings offer a unique perspective of the genomic adaptations driving red algal diversity and demonstrate how this highly successful group of red seaweeds can provide insight into the evolutionary origins and universal principles of complex multicellular plant life.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

To investigate how animals perceive these intermittent cues, we developed a behavioral task in which head-restrained mice made binary decisions based on the total number of discrete odor pulses presented stochastically over several seconds. Mice readily learned this task, and their performance was well-described by widely used decision models. Logistic regression of binary choices against the timing of odor pulses within the respiratory cycle revealed that mice placed higher perceptual weight to stimuli arriving during inhalation than exhalation, a phase dependency that strongly correlated with the magnitude of responses in olfactory sensory neurons. The population response of anterior piriform cortex (APCx) neurons to odor pulses was also modulated by respiration phase, although individual neurons displayed varying levels of phase-dependence. Single APCx neurons responded stochastically and transiently to odor pulses, leading to a representation that carries signatures of sensory evidence, but not its accumulation. Our study reveals that mice can integrate intermittent odor signals across dozens of breaths, but respiratory modulation of sensory inputs imposes limits on information acquisition that cortical circuits cannot overcome to improve behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Many redundant muscle patterns can solve a given task, and this high dimensionality allows flexibility but poses a problem for efficient learning. Although a feasible solution invokes subcortical innate motor patterns, or primitives, to reduce the dimensionality of the control problem, how cortex learns to utilize such primitives remains an open question. To address this, we studied cortical and subcortical interactions as head-fixed mice learned contextual control of innate hindlimb extension behavior. Naive mice performed reactive extensions to turn off a cold air stimulus within seconds and, using predictive cues, learned to avoid the stimulus altogether in tens of trials. Optogenetic inhibition of large areas of rostral cortex completely prevented avoidance behavior, but did not impair hindlimb extensions in reaction to the cold air stimulus. Remarkably, mice covertly learned to avoid the cold stimulus even without any prior experience of successful, cortically-mediated avoidance. These findings support a dynamic, heterarchical model in which the dominant locus of control can change, on the order of seconds, between cortical and subcortical brain areas. We propose that cortex can leverage periods when subcortex predominates as demonstrations, to learn parameterized control of innate behavioral primitives.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

CRISPR-based genetic screens have proven invaluable in elucidating gene function in mammalian cells. Single-cell functional genomics methods, such as Perturb-seq and Spear-ATAC, have made it possible to achieve high-throughput mapping of the functional effects of gene perturbations by profiling transcriptomes and DNA accessibility, respectively. Combining single-cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic data via multiomic approaches has facilitated the discovery of novel cis and gene regulatory interactions. However, pseudobulk readouts from cell populations can often cloud the interpretation of results due to a heterogeneous response from cells receiving the same genetic perturbation, which could be mitigated by using transcriptional profiles of single cells to subset the ATAC-seq data. Existing methods to capture CRISPR guide RNAs to simultaneously assess the impact of genetic perturbations on RNA and ATAC profiles require either cloning of gRNA libraries in specialized vectors or implementing complex protocols with multiple rounds of barcoding. Here, we introduce CAT-ATAC, a technique that adds CRISPR gRNA capture to the existing 10X Genomics Multiome assay, generating paired transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and perturbation identity data from the same individual cells. We demonstrate up to 77% guide capture efficiency for both arrayed and pooled delivery of lentiviral gRNAs in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and cancer cell lines. This capability allows us to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in cells under drug and genetic perturbations. By applying CAT-ATAC, we were able to identify a GRN associated with dasatinib resistance, indirectly activated by the HIC2 gene. Using loss of function experiments, we further validated that the gene, ZFPM2, a component of the predicted GRN, also contributes to dasatinib resistance. CAT-ATAC can thus be used to generate high-content multidimensional genotype-phenotype maps to reveal novel gene and cellular interactions and functions.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Explaining the extensive genetic variation of fitness-related traits is thus a longstanding puzzle in evolutionary biology, with cascading implications for ecology, conservation, and human health. Balancing selection--an umbrella term for scenarios of natural selection that maintain genetic variation--is a century-old explanation to resolve this paradox that has gained recent momentum from genome-scale methods for detecting it. Yet evaluating whether balancing selection can, in fact, resolve the paradox is challenging, given the logistical constraints of distinguishing balancing selection from alternative hypotheses and the daunting collection of theoretical models that formally underpin this debate. Here, we track the development of balancing selection theory over the last century and provide an accessible review of this rich collection of models. We first outline the range of biological scenarios that can generate balancing selection. We then examine how fundamental features of genetic systems--including non-random mating between individuals, differences in ploidy, genetic drift, and different genetic architectures of traits--have been progressively incorporated into the theory. We end by linking these theoretical predictions to ongoing empirical efforts to understand the evolutionary processes that explain genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Clearance occurs through both protein degradation and growth-dependent dilution. At slow growth, clearance is dominated by degradation, which leads to the accumulation of long lived proteins. At fast growth, however, it is dominated by dilution, preventing this accumulation. Thus, the concentration of long lived proteins will be reduced unless cells compensate by preferentially increasing synthesis rates. To determine the dominant regulatory mechanisms, we quantified the degree of compensation between activated and resting human B cells and across mouse tissues. The results indicate that growth-dependent dilution is insufficiently compensated for by changes in protein synthesis, and it accounts for over a third of the concentration changes between high and low growth conditions. Furthermore, we find that about 25 % of the differences in protein concentration across all tissues are controlled by protein clearance. When comparing only slowly growing tissues such as the brain and pancreas, clearance differences explain as much as 42 %. Within a tissue or cell type, clearance variation is sufficient to account for 50 % of the abundance variation for all measured proteins at slow growth, contrasted with 7 % at fast growth. Thus, our model unifies previous observations with our new results and highlights a context-dependent and larger than previously appreciated contribution of protein degradation in shaping protein variation both across the proteome and across cell states.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

To uncover the contributions of individual segment pairings to selective packaging, we set out to statistically analyse packaging defects and inter-segment distances in individual A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) virus particles. To enable such analysis, we developed a multiplexed DNA-PAINT approach capable of assessing the segment stoichiometry of more than 10,000 individual virus particles in one experiment; our approach can also spatially resolve the individual segments inside complete virus particles with a localisation precision of ~10 nm.

Our results show the influenza genome can be assembled through multiple pathways in a redundant and cooperative process guided by preferentially interacting segment pairs and aided by synergistic effects that enhance genome assembly, driving it to completion. Our structural evidence indicates that the interaction strength of segment pairs affects the spatial configuration of the gene segments, which appears to be preserved in mature virions. As our method quantified the interactions of whole influenza segments instead of identifying individual sequence-based interactions, our results can serve as a template to quantify the contributions of individual sequence motifs to selective packaging.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

While many network models have been proposed to describe connectome communication, current approaches assume that every pair of neural elements communicates according to the same principle. Connectomes, however, are heterogeneous networks, comprising elements with varied topological and neurobiological makeups. In this paper, we investigate how connectome architecture may facilitate different signalling regimes depending on the topological embedding of communicating neural elements. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that the modular structure of brain networks fosters a dual mode of communication balancing diffusion--passive signal broadcasting--and routing--selective transmission via efficient paths. To this end, we introduce the relative diffusion score (RDS), a measure to quantify the proportional capacity for network communication via diffusion versus routing. We examined the interplay between RDS and connectome architecture in 6 organisms spanning a wide range of spatial resolutions and connectivity mapping techniques--from the complete nervous system of the larval fly to the inter-areal human connectome. Our analyses establish multiple lines of evidence suggesting that connectomes may be universally organised to support within-module diffusion and between-module routing. Using a series of rewiring null models, we untangle the contributions of connectome topology and geometry to the relationship between routing, diffusion and modular architecture. In conclusion, our work puts forth a hybrid conceptualisation of neural communication, in which diffusion contributes to functional segregation by concentrating information within localised clusters, while specialised signal routes enable fast, long-range and cross-system functional integration.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Two primary approaches have emerged for this task: supervised sequence-to-function models trained on functional genomics experimental data and self-supervised DNA language models that learn evolutionary constraints on sequences. However, the field currently lacks consistently curated datasets with accurate labels, especially for non-coding variants, that are necessary to comprehensively benchmark these models and advance the field. In this work, we present TraitGym, a curated dataset of regulatory genetic variants that are either known to be causal or are strong candidates across 113 Mendelian and 83 complex traits, along with carefully constructed control variants. We frame the causal variant prediction task as a binary classification problem and benchmark various models, including functional-genomics-supervised models, self-supervised models, models that combine machine learning predictions with curated annotation features, and ensembles of these. Our results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of different approaches for predicting the functional consequences of non-coding genetic variants. We find that alignment-based models CADD and GPN-MSA compare favorably for Mendelian traits and complex disease traits, while functional-genomics-supervised models Enformer and Borzoi perform better for complex non-disease traits.

MRSA strains are resistant to front-line beta-lactams due to PBP2a, a low-affinity penicillin-binding protein encoded by mecA. Daptomycin is used to treat MRSA infections but is not always effective and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Understanding why daptomycin fails is crucial to devising strategies to improve treatment outcomes. Here, using a panel of clinical bacteraemia isolates, we show that MRSA strains are less susceptible to daptomycin than methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. This difference in susceptibility was due to mecA and was independent of any changes in surface properties previously associated with altered daptomycin susceptibility. Instead, using a mecA transposon mutant, we found that a lack of this gene led to higher activity of the Agr quorum sensing system, resulting in an increased release of the phenol-soluble modulin toxins. Increased levels of these surfactant-like toxins prevented daptomycin from being inactivated by lipids released by the bacteria, leading to enhanced susceptibility to the antibiotic. Additionally, the clinical MRSA strains tested produced lower levels of toxins than the MSSA strains and inactivated daptomycin to a greater extent, explaining their reduced susceptibility. Expression of mecA in clinical MSSA strains reduced toxin production, increasing daptomycin inactivation and thereby enhancing survival. Together, these results demonstrate that mecA does not only affect beta-lactam susceptibility but also compromises the efficacy of the last resort antibiotic daptomycin.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

One physiological change during the vertebrate stress response is the release of glucocorticoid hormones. Here, we measured plasma corticosterone in female domesticated budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) to test whether human presence, restraint, or removal and return of a newly stressed neighbor increases corticosterone. The presence of humans for 15 minutes at the beginning of the experiment did not significantly elevate corticosterone above baseline levels, suggesting that birds that acclimate to humans are minimally affected by their presence. However, at the end of the experiment after multiple blood sampling events, the same human presence test significantly elevated corticosterone above baseline and human presence levels measured at the beginning of the experiment. Thus, repeated blood sampling could cause progressively stronger stress responses to human presence. Restraint-induced corticosterone levels were significantly higher than all other treatments, indicating that human handling activates the stress response. After stressed birds were returned home, corticosterone levels of their neighbors were significantly higher than baseline at 25- and 45-minutes post-return. However, the 25- and 45-minute corticosterone levels were not significantly different from each other, or levels induced by human presence at the beginning or end of the experiment. This outcome suggests that social transmission of stress was limited across the sampled time frame. These data highlight the importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of different human-animal interactions in captivity, including in domesticated species that are more tolerant of forced proximity to humans.

One such map, the head-direction representation, is believed to be primarily driven by vestibular motion signals in mammals. Here, we combine in vivo imaging of neuronal activity, genetic perturbation of neuronal circuits, behavioral testing, and theoretical modeling to show that the representation of head direction in mouse is driven by not only vestibular but also visual motion signals: both are essential, and the latter, originating in direction-selective retinal ganglion cell activity, dominates at low speeds. We show that, correspondingly, visual perturbations alter navigational behavior that relies on head-direction computation. Finally, we find that head-direction representation and the slow phase of reflexive eye movement are tightly correlated, and we propose a theoretical model that elucidates their emergence from coupled visual and vestibular processes. Our results suggest that the brains estimate of head direction is built on an oculomotor reflex pathway driven by both visual and vestibular signals.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

We report that double strand breaks (DSB) induce de novo formation of chromatin loops, with the break positioned at the loop base. These loops form only in S/G2 phases and occur during repair via homologous recombination (HR), concomitant with DNA end resection and RAD51 assembly. RAD51 showed two-tiered accumulation around DSBs, with a broad (~Mb) domain arising from the homology search. This domain is regulated by cohesin unloader, is constrained by TAD boundaries, and it overlaps with chromatin regions reeled through the break-anchored loop, suggesting that loop extrusion regulates the homology search. Indeed, depletion of NIPBL results in reduced HR, and this effect is more pronounced when the HR donor is far (~100 kb) from the break. Our data indicates that loop-extruding cohesin promotes the mammalian homology search by facilitating break-chromatin interactions within the damaged TAD.

Recently, computational modeling has emerged as a promising approach for characterizing sources of this heterogeneity, which could potentially aid in clinical differentiation. In this study, we tested whether computational mechanisms of decision-making under approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) where behavior is expected to have both positive and negative outcomes - may have utility in this regard. We first carried out a set of pre-registered modeling analyses in a sample of 480 individuals who completed an established AAC task. These analyses aimed to replicate cross-sectional and longitudinal results from a prior dataset (N=478) - suggesting that mechanisms of decision uncertainty (DU) and emotion conflict (EC) differentiate individuals with depression, anxiety, substance use disorders, and healthy comparisons. We then combined the prior and current datasets and employed a stacked machine learning approach to assess whether these computational measures could successfully perform out-of-sample classification between diagnostic groups. This revealed above-chance differentiation between affective and substance use disorders (balanced accuracy > 0.688), both in the presence and absence of co-morbidities. These results demonstrate the predictive utility of computational measures in characterizing distinct mechanisms of psychopathology and may point to novel treatment targets.","NA","medrxiv",1739570859423

However, they also increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

MethodsWe consider genetic variants in the region of the HMGCR gene, which encodes the target of statins, and their associations with downstream consequences of statins. We use various statistical methods to identify causal pathways influencing CAD and T2D, and investigate whether these are the same or different for the two diseases.

ResultsColocalization analyses indicated that LDL-C and body mass index (BMI) have distinct genetic predictors in this gene region, suggesting that they do not lie on the same causal pathway. Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses restricted to variants in the HMGCR gene region revealed LDL-C and BMI as causal risk factors for CAD, and BMI as a causal risk factor for T2D, but not LDL-C. A Bayesian model averaging method prioritized BMI as the most likely causal risk factor for T2D, and LDL-C as the second most likely causal risk factor for CAD (behind ubiquinone). Colocalization analyses provided consistent evidence of LDL-C colocalizing with CAD, and BMI colocalizing with T2D; evidence was inconsistent for colocalization of LDL-C with T2D, and BMI with CAD.

ConclusionsOur analyses suggest cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of statin usage are on different causal pathways, and hence could be influenced separately by targeted interventions. More broadly, our analysis workflow offers potential insights to identify pathway-specific causal risk factors that could provide possible repositioning or refinement opportunities for existing drug targets.

Advances in long-read sequencing have allowed highly accurate TE detection, though at a higher cost than short-read sequencing. Recent studies using long reads have shown that existing short-read TE detection methods perform inadequately when applied to real data. In this study, we use a machine learning approach (called TEforest) to discover and genotype TE insertions and deletions with short-read data by using TEs detected from long-read genome assemblies as training data. Our method first uses a highly sensitive algorithm to discover potential TE insertion or deletion sites in the genome, extracting relevant features from short-read alignments. To discriminate between true and false TE insertions, we train a random forest model with a labeled ground-truth dataset for which we have calculated the same set of short-read features. We conduct a comprehensive benchmark of TEforest and traditional TE detection methods using real data, finding that TEforest identifies more true positives and fewer false positives across datasets with different read lengths and coverages, while also accurately inferring genotypes and the precise breakpoints of insertions.

By learning short-read signatures of TEs previously only discoverable using long reads, our approach bridges the gap between large-scale population genetic studies and the accuracy of long-read assemblies. This work provides a user-friendly tool to study the prevalence and phenotypic effects of TE insertions across the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

We were unable to recover a Pinky-free culture of Crusty via usage of antibiotics. However, when exposed to antibiotics that kill or stop the growth of the Pinky, growth of Crusty is significantly stunted, implying that actively growing Pinky symbionts are needed for Crustys optimal growth. The Crusty-Pinky symbiosis also seems to be able to perform active metabolism in carbonless and nitrogenless medium, which we believe is due to Pinkys ability to perform aerobic anoxygenic photosynthesis.

Under nutrient starvation, Bt cells differentiate into spores and associated toxin crystals that can adopt biofilm-like aggregates. We reveal that such Bt spore/toxin biofilms are embedded in a fibrous extrasporal matrix (ESM), and using cryoID, we resolved the structure and molecular identity of an uncharacterized type of pili, referred to here as Fibrillar ENdospore Appendages or  F-ENA. F-ENA are monomolecular protein polymers tethered to the exosporium of Bt and are decorated with a flexible tip fibrillum. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that F-ENA is widespread not only in the class Bacilli, but also in the class Clostridia, and the cryoEM structures of F-ENA filaments from Bacillus, Anaerovorax and Paenibaccilus reveal subunits with a generic head-neck domain structure, where the {beta}-barrel neck of variable length latch onto a preceding head domain through short N-terminal hook peptides. In Bacillus, two collagen-like proteins (CLP) respectively tether F-ENA to the exosporium (F-Anchor), or constitute the tip fibrillum at the distal terminus of F-ENA (F-BclA). Sedimentation assays point towards F-ENA involvement in spore-spore clustering, likely mediated via F-BclA contacts and F-ENA bundling through the antiparallel interlocking of the head-neck units.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

In this study, we created a mouse model of PD by overexpressing -synuclein through a combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the medial and lateral substantia nigra (SN). We also demonstrated that chronic administration of the c-Abl inhibitor PD180970 provides neuroprotection in this model. Mice injected with the AAV6--synuclein and PFF combination showed a progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN and their projections in the striatum over 24 weeks. This neuronal loss coincided with a time-dependent accumulation of phosphorylated -synuclein (p-syn) in the SN. The p-syn aggregates spread to synaptically connected DARPP-32-positive neurons in the striatum and further extended to the cortex. We also observed a contralateral spread of p-syn aggregates. Additionally, -synuclein overexpression led to a significant increase in activated microglia and astrocytes at all timepoints, with the strongest activation occurring early and gradually diminishing over time. Daily administration of PD180970 significantly reduced the loss of DA neurons caused by -synuclein injection and decreased the accumulation of p-syn in the SN. PD180970 treatment also reduced the neuroinflammation significantly. Overall, the combined injection of AAV6--synuclein and preformed fibrils into the mouse brain establishes a robust PD model, enabling detailed mechanistic studies of the disease. We further demonstrate the model's utility for chronic neuroprotection studies using the potential drug PD180970, highlighting its broad applicability.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Although recent break- throughs in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled high-quality reconstruction of numerous complex biomolecules, the resolution of bound lig- ands is often relatively poor. Furthermore, automated methods for building and refining molecular models into cryo-EM maps have largely focused on proteins and may not be optimized for the diverse properties of small-molecule ligands. Here, we present an approach that integrates generative artificial intelligence (AI) with cryo-EM density-guided simulations to fit ligands into experimental maps. Using three inputs: 1) a protein amino acid sequence, 2) a ligand specification, and 3) an experimental cryo-EM map, we validated our approach on a set of biomedically relevant protein-ligand complexes including kinases, GPCRs, and solute transporters, none of which were present in the AI training data. In cases for which generative AI was not sufficient to predict experimental poses outright, integration of flexible fitting into molecular dynamics simulations improved ligand model-to-map cross-correlation relative to the deposited structure from 40-71% to 82-95%. This work offers a straightforward template for integrating generative AI and density-guided simulations to automate model building in cryo-EM maps of ligand-protein complexes, with potential applications for characterization and design of novel modulators and drugs.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

One key impediment to successful treatment outcomes is increased drug craving that occurs over the course of abstinence and subsequent relapse to drug use. This phenomenon, known as the incubation of drug craving, has been modeled extensively in rodent models of intravenous drug self-administration. As commonly implemented, the design of intravenous self-administration preclinical studies precludes disentangling appetitive and consummatory behaviors as drug seeking (appetitive) and taking (consummatory) is simultaneous. Here, we employed a model of oral cocaine self-administration to interrogate the incubation of drug vs nondrug craving, where the route of administration is identical between reinforcers and appetitive and consummatory behaviors are dissociable. Oral self-administration of cocaine produced detectable levels of cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, within the blood and brain, and blood and brain levels of both substrates correlated with cocaine consumption. When tested for seeking- (lever pressing) and taking-related (magazine head entries) behavior after 1 or 21 days of forced abstinence from cocaine or saccharin, we observed incubation of lever pressing among cocaine-administering mice and incubation of magazine entries among saccharin-administering mice. These behavioral changes were accompanied by reduced expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of cocaine self-administering mice, regardless of abstinence. Altogether, these results underscore the utility of this model of cocaine self-administration, highlight the conserved nature of incubated cocaine seeking across routes of administration, and demonstrate the dissociable neurobehavioral sequelae of the incubation of reward seeking across reinforcer types.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Members of the recently identified family of bridge-like lipid transfer proteins (BLTPs) span opposing membranes at these contact sites to enable the rapid transfer of bulk lipids between organelles. While the VPS13 and ATG2 family members use organelle-specific adaptors for membrane targeting, the mechanisms that regulate other bridge-like transporters remain unknown. Here, we identify the conserved protein Ybl086c, which we name Hoi1 (Hob interactor 1), as an adaptor that targets the yeast BLTP2-like proteins Fmp27/Hob1 and Hob2 to ER-PM contact sites. Two separate Hoi1 domains interface with alpha-helical projections that decorate the central hydrophobic channel on Fmp27, and loss of these interactions disrupts cellular sterol homeostasis. The mutant phenotypes of BLTP2 and HOI1 orthologs indicate these proteins act in a shared pathway in worms and flies. Together, this suggests that Hoi1-mediated recruitment of BLTP2-like proteins represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating lipid transport at membrane contact sites.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

However, the mechanisms driving its adherence to skin remain poorly understood. Here, we developed in vitro systems to allow for detailed analysis of early skin colonization events and identified critical host and pathogen mediators of attachment. Across multiple strains and clades of C. auris, we identified that Als4112, a conserved adhesin, is required for skin colonization via keratinocyte attachment and direct interactions with host extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, especially basement membrane proteins such as laminin. In a murine epicutaneous infection and human skin explants, deletion of ALS4112 significantly reduced skin colonization, underscoring its essential role in establishing cutaneous persistence. Als4112 also contributes to systemic infection, highlighting the connection between adherence and pathogenicity in this organism. Finally, coating plastic and catheter surfaces with collagen I or III markedly inhibited C. auris attachment and biofilm formation, offering an approach to curb nosocomial transmission. Our study highlights the critical role of Als4112 in C. auris colonization and virulence in vivo, making it an attractive target for future vaccine development.

Understanding the neural mechanism of cognitive reserve could help assessing the therapeutic effectiveness of interventions in AD. To address this, here, 38 elderly participants performed a sustained attention task during high-density EEG while awake and during drowsiness. Operationally, the degree to which performance was impaired under drowsiness signalled the extent of cognitive reserve, with less impairment indicating a higher level of cognitive reserve. Investigating performance variations during the active management of neural challenges offers a novel approach to studying cognitive reserve, capturing dynamics that mirror everyday cognitive demand. We related cognitive reserve to various measures, including informational complexity using the Lempel-Ziv (LZSUM) algorithm. We found a significant interaction effect between arousal and performance, where LZSUM values increased in high performers when drowsy but decreased in low performers. This effect was most pronounced in the frontal and central areas. Our findings suggest LZSUM to be indicative of a compensatory mechanism and thus show potential for LZSUM as a neural marker in assessing cognitive reserve. However, we found no consistent relationship between performance and structural brain measures, and proxies of cognitive reserve. Critically, our findings present a counterexample to the prevailing view that informational complexity purely reflects conscious level. Further research, such as a study with the same paradigm in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, may lead to additional insights of whether we are truly measuring cognitive reserve.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Auxiliary or non-catalytic proteins can play a critical role in modulating metabolic flux and pathway efficiency. Chalcone isomerase-like (CHIL) is a non-catalytic protein known to serve as a partner to chalcone synthase (CHS) in flavonoid biosynthesis, rectifying its promiscuous activity and preventing by-product formation, such as the aberrant p-coumaroyltriacetic acid lactone (CTAL). Here, we extended the characterization of CHILs to the legume-characteristic isoflavonoid pathway. We assessed four CHIL orthologs from diverse plant lineages: Glycine max (GmCHIL), Oryza sativa (OsCHIL), Selaginella moellendorffii (SmCHIL), and Marchantia polymorpha (MpCHIL). Structural modelling suggested that naringenin (flavanone) entry into the CHIL binding cleft may be sterically hindered compared to catalytic CHIs. Moreover, legume CHIL isoforms possess an additional bulky residue, Tyr48, that is expected to impose further constraints on ligand binding. In vitro, CHS produced up to 60% lactone CTAL instead of its desired output; however, CHIL suppressed this aberrant activity to 10%, concomitantly increasing target compound titers. Combinatorial enzyme and yeast biotransformation assays revealed a critical role for CHIL in conducting flux through chalcone, flavanone, and isoflavone biosynthesis. The inclusion of CHIL in our engineered yeast strains enhanced overall titers and, unexpectedly, promoted carbon flux toward the so-called deoxy-branch (isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and daidzein) by up to 67%, with a 33% increase in final daidzein titers. By extending CHIL characterization to the isoflavonoid pathway, we have revealed an expanded role for this auxiliary protein and underscored its utility in engineered metabolic contexts. Our findings reiterate the often-overlooked impact of non-catalytic proteins in shaping specialized metabolism.

The crystal structures of the ferritin mutants revealed histidine-histidine interactions, forming well-defined histidine clusters (His-clusters).

Molecular dynamics simulations further highlight the co-localization of TMB and hydrogen peroxide at the histidine-rich clusters, indicating that the confined environment of the ferritin cage enhances their interactions.

We conducted an in vivo longitudinal rat model with three main goals. 1) to determine if chronic stress increases ethanol intake; 2) to determine the effect of chronic- stress and ethanol intake in behavioral measures, brain structure, and function; and 3) to investigate the effect of sex. This observational study included Wistar rats assigned to four groups: 1) ethanol consumption (EtOH+/CRS-), 2) stress exposure (EtOH-/CRS+), 3) both ethanol and stress exposure (EtOH+/CRS+), and 4) control group (EtOH-/CRS-). Our results showed that chronic stress did not affect ethanol intake but led to reduced body weight gain, elevated corticosterone levels, and impaired recognition memory. Structural MRI revealed that both exposures produced additive brain volume changes in regions such as the olfactory bulb, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Functional connectivity analysis using network-based statistics identified disrupted cortical-subcortical connections. Results found here were sex-dependent in terms of volumetric changes (higher effects on males) and functional connectivity (higher effects on females).

However, while Bayesian integration provides a powerful explanatory framework, the question remains as to what extent it explains human behaviour in naturalistic situations, including more complex movements and distributions. Here, we examine whether humans can learn bimodal priors in a complex sensorimotor task: returning tennis serves. Participants returned serves in an immersive virtual reality setup with realistic movements and spatiotemporal task demands matching those in real tennis. The location of the opponents serves followed a bimodal distribution. We manipulated visual uncertainty through three levels of ball speeds: slow, moderate, and fast. After extensive exposure to the opponents serves, participants movements were biased by the bimodal prior distribution. As predicted by Bayesian theory, the magnitude of the bias depends on visual uncertainty. Additionally, our data indicate that participants movements in this complex task were not only biased by prior expectations but also by biomechanical constraints and associated motor costs. Intriguingly, an explicit knowledge test after the experiment revealed that, despite incorporating prior knowledge of the opponents serve distribution into their behaviour, participants were not explicitly aware of the pattern.

The replication and segregation of elements integrated into the host chromosome are ensured by the host life cycle. In contrast, the persistence of autonomously replicating elements relies on their ability to remain within the host population. Here, we assess the evolutionary success of different persistence strategies of prokaryotic plasmids. Through intracellular competitions between plasmid genotypes, we find that combining active partitioning during cell division with a toxin-antitoxin (TA) system for post-segregational killing is more effective than either strategy alone. Mathematical modeling of long-term plasmid evolution, calibrated with empirical plasmid persistence probabilities, further supports these findings. A survey of enterobacterial genomes indicates that partitioning and TA systems are core features of large conjugative plasmids. Indeed, we confirm the presence of a previously unrecognized type I TA system in IncX3 plasmids, which serve as important vectors of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. These findings suggest that large conjugative plasmids likely encode TA systems, including those yet to be identified. The combination of TA and partitioning systems emerges as the most effective strategy for the persistence of low-copy extrachromosomal elements with unstable segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Owing to its high through-put and gentle, volumetric imaging nature, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an attractive modality to image such samples. However, the orthogonal dual-objective geometry of LSFM makes sample mounting challenging. Oblique plane microscopy (OPM) circumvents these issues by achieving light-sheet imaging through a single objective near the sample, with a further two objectives acting to image a tilted, oblique plane in the specimen. However, at low magnification, as required for mesoscopic imaging, conventional OPM systems suffer from a complicated and inefficient light path and/or a limited numerical aperture. Here we present a simple method for mesoscopic OPM that enables efficient light collection at any numerical aperture. By placing the camera directly in the remote space, the oblique plane can be imaged without the need for a third microscope system. Using a commercially available camera with 1.4 {micro}m pixels, we demonstrate imaging over a 5.3 x 3 x 2.6 mm3 field of view with a lateral resolution of [~]2 {micro}m and axial resolution of [~]22 {micro}m. Our technique is then used to image a 4x-expanded brain organoid.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Recently, we discovered that identical capsid-forming phage-inducible chromosomal islands (cf-PICIs), a new family of phage satellites, are present across multiple species and genera, raising questions about their widespread dissemination. Here we have identified and characterized a new biological entity enabling this transfer. Unlike other satellites, cf-PICIs produce their own capsids and package their DNA, relying solely on phage tails for transfer. Remarkably, cf-PICIs release non-infective, tail-less capsids containing their DNA into the environment. These subcellular entities then interact with phage tails from various species, forming chimeric particles that inject DNA into different bacterial species depending on the tail present. Additionally, we elucidated the structure of the tail-less cf-PICIs and the mechanism behind their unique capsid formation. Our findings illuminate novel mechanisms used by satellites to spread in nature, contributing to bacterial evolution and the emergence of new pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

In humans, this domain is encoded by genes within the IGHC locus, where descriptions of genomic diversity remain incomplete. To address this, we utilized long-read genomic datasets to build a high-quality IGHC haplotype/variant catalog from 105 individuals of diverse ancestry, and developed a high-throughput approach for targeted long-read IGHC locus sequencing and assembly. From locally phased assemblies, we discovered previously uncharacterized single nucleotide variants (SNV) and complex structural variants (SVs, n=7), as well as novel genes and alleles. Of the 262 identified IGHC coding alleles, 235 (89.6%) were undocumented. SNV, SV, and gene allele/genotype frequencies revealed significant population differentiation, including; (i) hundreds of SNVs in African and East Asian populations exceeding fixation index (FST) of 0.3, (ii) and an IGHG4 haplotype carrying specific coding variants uniquely enriched in East and South Asian populations. Our results illuminate missing signatures of haplotype diversity in the IGHC locus, including evidence of natural selection, and establish a new foundation for investigating IGHC germline variation and its role in Ab function and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

While the well-studied zebrafish posterior lateral line has emerged as a powerful model to study collective cell migration, far less is known about development of the anterior lateral line, which produces the supraorbital and infraorbital lines around the eye, as well as mandibular and opercular lines over the jaw and cheek. Here we show that normal development of the zebrafish anterior lateral line system from cranial placodes is dependent on another vertebrate-specific cell type, the cranial neural crest. We find that cranial neural crest and anterior lateral lines develop in close proximity, with absence of neural crest cells leading to major disruptions in the overlying anterior lateral line system. Specifically, in the absence of neural crest neither supraorbital nor infraorbital lateral lines fully extend, such that the most anterior cranial regions remain devoid of neuromasts, while supernumerary ectopic neuromasts form in the posterior supraorbital region. Both neural crest and cranial placodes contribute neurons to the lateral line ganglia that innervate the neuromasts and in the absence of neural crest these ganglia, as well as the lateral line afferent nerves, are disrupted. Finally, we establish that as ontogeny proceeds, the most anterior supraorbital neuromasts come to lie within neural crest-derived frontal and nasal bones in the developing cranium. These are the same anterior supraorbital neuromasts that are absent or mislocated in specimens lacking neural crest cells. Together, our results establish that cranial neural crest and cranial placode derivatives function in concert over the course of ontogeny to build the complex cranial lateral line system.

In particular, the use of appropriate controls is critical for drawing meaningful biological conclusions. However, controls are often inadequately applied or overlooked in favour of achieving statistical significance, frequently obtained through the misuse or misinterpretation of statistical tests. In this study, we reanalyse a publicly available image dataset to highlight the crucial role of controls in interpreting experimental outcomes. Our findings underscore the importance of focusing on effect sizes and biological relevance over arbitrary statistical thresholds. We also discuss the diminishing returns of increased data collection once statistical stability has been achieved, advocating for more efficient experimental designs. By refining control usage and emphasising effect sizes, this work aims to enhance the reproducibility and robustness of research findings. We provide open-access code to allow researchers to engage with the dataset, promoting better practices in experimental design and data interpretation.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

However, these models come with inherent challenges due to line-to-line and clonal variability. To combat this issue, the iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative (iNDI) has generated an iPSC repository using a single clonal reference line, KOLF2.1J, into which disease-causing mutations and revertants are introduced via gene editing. Here we describe the generation and validation of lines carrying the most common causative mutation for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene, for the iNDI collection of neurodegenerative iPSC models. We demonstrate that these C9orf72 knock-in lines differentiate efficiently into neurons and display characteristic C9orf72-associated pathologies, including reduced C9orf72 levels and the presence of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) and RNA foci, which increase in abundance over time in culture. These pathologies are not present in revertant cells lacking the repeat expansion. These repeat expansion and revertant cell lines are now available to academic and for-profit institutions through the JAX iPS cell repository and will help to facilitate and standardise iPSC-based ALS/FTD research.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

However, conventional spike sorting methods are highly fragmented, labor-intensive, and heavily reliant on expert manual curation, limiting their scalability and reproducibility. This challenge has become more pressing with advances in neural recording technology, such as high-density Neuropixels for large-scale neural recording or flexible electrodes for long-term stable recording over months to years. The volume and complexity of these datasets make manual curation infeasible, requiring an automated and scalable solution. Here, we introduce SpikeAgent, a multimodal large language model (LLM)-based AI agent that automates and standardizes the entire spike sorting pipeline. Unlike traditional approaches, SpikeAgent integrates multiple LLM backends, coding functions, and established algorithms, autonomously performing spike sorting with reasoning-based decision-making and real-time interaction with intermediate results. It generates interpretable reports, providing transparent justifications for each sorting decision, enhancing transparency and reliability. We benchmarked SpikeAgent against human experts across various neural recording technology, demonstrating its versatility and ability to achieve curation consistency that are equal to, or even higher than human experts. It also drastically reduces the expertise barrier and accelerates the curation and validation time by orders of magnitude. Moreover, it enables automated interpretability of the neural spiking data, which cannot be achieved by any conventional methods. SpikeAgent presents a paradigm shift in processing signals for neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces, while laying the ground for AI agent-augmented science across various domains.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423

Previous studies have shown that many IC neurons exhibit receptive fields for individual features of auditory stimuli, such as sound frequency, intensity, and location, but growing evidence suggests that some IC neurons may multiplex features of sound. Here, we used in vivo juxtacellular recordings in awake, head-fixed mice to examine how IC neurons responded to frequency-modulated sweeps that varied in speed, direction, intensity, and frequency range. We then applied machine learning methods to determine how individual IC neurons encode features of FM sweeps. We found that individual IC neurons multiplex FM sweep features using various strategies including spike timing, distribution of inter-spike intervals, and first spike latency. In addition, we found that decoding accuracy for sweep direction can vary with sweep speed and frequency range, suggesting the presence of mixed selectivity in single neurons. Accordingly, using static receptive fields for direction alone yielded poor predictions of neuron responses to vocalizations that contain simple frequency changes. Lastly, we showed that encoding strategies varied across individual neurons, resulting in a highly informative population response for FM sweep features. Together, our results suggest that multiplexing sound features is a common mechanism used by IC neurons to represent complex sounds.","NA","biorxiv",1739570859423
