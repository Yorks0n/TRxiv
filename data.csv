In the zebrafish heart, spatially confined single-cell delamination in the ventricle outer curvature initiates trabeculation, a conserved morphogenetic process critical for heart function and embryonic life. Yet, what confines delamination in the ventricle outer curvature remains ill-understood. Contrary to the prevailing notion of patterning through biochemical signals, we now show that mechanical fracturing of the cardiac extracellular matrix (cECM) patterns delamination in the outer curvature. cECM fractures emerge preferentially in the outer curvature, cells delaminate into these fractures and experimental blocking of fractures blocks delamination. These fractures display characteristic signature of mechanical defects and myocardial tissue contractility is sufficient to fracture the cECM, independent of molecular signals, enzymatic activity, or delamination events. Notably, the anisotropic geometry of myocardial tissue generates higher mechanical strain in the outer curvature, thereby locally patterning cECM fractures and delamination. Consequently, cECM fractures evolve in response to dynamic changes in tissue geometry, and experimental manipulation of tissue geometry is sufficient to alter the fracture pattern. Together, our findings underscore mechanical fractures as a morphogenetic strategy, and more generally, corroborate the long-standing but understudied paradigm that tissue form-function can feed back to steer its own patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

Despite noradrenaline's key role in these interactions, its specific contribution to interoceptive processes remains unclear. In a placebo-controlled, randomised, within-subject study, we employed computational modelling of interoceptive psychophysics to determine how pharmacological beta-adrenoceptor antagonism controls interoception across cardiac and respiratory domains. Both cardio-selective bisoprolol and non-selective propranolol improved cardiac perceptual sensitivity, with bisoprolol exerting an enhanced effect on cardiac metacognition. In contrast, both beta-blockers increased respiratory perceptual precision, with no corresponding changes in sensitivity or metacognition. These findings reveal a novel dissociation between central and peripheral beta-adrenergic mechanisms in interoception, highlighting the pivotal role of peripheral noradrenaline in regulating multi-organ brain-body interactions. Our results suggest that beta-blockers may provide promising routes for modulating distinct facets of interoception, potentially opening new avenues for intervention in conditions characterised by disrupted bodily self-awareness.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores.

While differential transcription factor binding is known to regulate gene expression, how CREs integrate the amount and combination of inputs to secure precise spatiotemporal profiles of gene expression remains unclear. Here, we developed a high-throughput combinatorial screening strategy, that we term NeMECiS, to investigate signal-dependent synthetic CREs (synCREs) in differentiating mammalian stem cells. By concatenating fragments of functional CREs from genes that respond to Sonic Hedgehog in the developing vertebrate neural tube, we found that CRE activity follows hierarchical design rules. While individual 200-base-pair fragments showed minimal activity, their combinations generated thousands of functional signal-responsive synCREs, many exceeding the activity of natural sequences. Statistical modelling revealed CRE function can be decomposed into specific quantitative contributions in which sequence fragments combine through a multiplicative rule, tuned by their relative positioning and spacing. These findings provide a predictive framework for CRE redesign, which we used to engineer synthetic CREs that alter the pattern of motor neuron differentiation in neural tissue. These findings establish quantitative principles for engineering synthetic regulatory elements with programmable signal responses to rewire genetic circuits and control stem cell differentiation, providing a basis for understanding developmental gene regulation and designing therapeutic gene expression systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

While recent studies indicate that nucleosomes are clustered as condensed chromatin domains in higher eukaryotic cells, how histone H1 mechanically condenses chromatin remains unclear. Here, using a combination of direct visualization of single-H1 molecules in living human cells and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the majority of H1 behaves like a liquid inside chromatin domains, rather than binding stably to nucleosomes as suggested by the traditional model. H1 functions as a liquid-like ''glue'', mediating dynamic multivalent interactions between nucleosomes within chromatin domains. Consistently, rapid-depletion of H1.2 leads to decondensed chromatin domains both in cells and in silico. Our findings suggest that the H1 ''glue'' condenses chromatin domains while keeping them fluid and accessible, thereby supporting essential DNA transactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

However, the molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the peripheral nervous system remain poorly understood, with ongoing debate about whether sensory neurons can be directly infected by the virus. In this study, human iPSC-derived sensory neurons were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 BA.5 variant, a mutant virus, or viral S1 proteins. Under control conditions, sensory neurons exhibited low expression of ACE2. However, exposure to BA.5 or S1 proteins significantly upregulated ACE2 expression in peripherin-positive sensory neurons. Virological analysis confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons, including olfactory neurons. Moreover, exposure to the live virus or S1 proteins induced TRPV1 upregulation and translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol, resulting in axonal destruction. Single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis revealed that viral exposure enhanced cAMP signaling, virus receptor and transmembrane transporter activities, and inflammatory regulation of TRP channels, which collectively contributed to synaptic and axonal damage. Importantly, treatment with a TRPV1 antagonist demonstrated neuroprotective effects. These findings underscore the need for further research into the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TRPV1, as well as its downstream signaling pathways, to develop therapeutic strategies for preventing sensory neuron loss during viral infections.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Most prominently, ribosome expression scales near linearly with the cellular growth rate to provide sufficient translational capacity while preventing metabolically wasteful ribosomal excess. In microbes, such proteome adjustments can passively perpetuate through symmetric cell division. However, in animals, a passive propagation is hindered by the separation between soma and germline. This separation raises the crucial question whether the proteome of animals is reset at every generation or can be propagated from parent to offspring despite this barrier. We addressed this question by exploring the intergenerational effects of dietary restriction in C. elegans, combining proteomics and live imaging. While most proteins showed no intergenerational regulation, ribosomal proteins remained reduced in offspring after maternal dietary restriction. When offspring of dietarily restricted mothers were raised under improved dietary conditions, this reduced ribosome content delayed their growth until normal ribosomal protein levels were restored. Soma-specific maternal inhibition of mTORC1 signalling replicated these effects, while other growth-reducing perturbations, such as reduced insulin signalling or maternal ribosome depletion, did not impact offspring ribosomes. Thus, mTORC1 signalling bridges across the soma-germline divide to regulate ribosome levels of the next generation, likely priming the offspring for the anticipated demand in protein synthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

Perturbation-based approaches allow the precise estimation of neural dynamic models and have been extensively applied in studies of brain functions and neural state transitions. However, the question of how optimal perturbations which most effectively identify dynamical models in neuroscience should be designed remains unclear. To address this, we propose a novel theoretical framework for estimating optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in linear time-invariant systems. The model represents neural dynamics using a connectivity matrix and an input matrix. Our framework derives an objective function to optimize perturbation inputs, which minimizes estimation errors in the model matrices. Building upon this, we further explore the relationship of this function with stimulation patterns commonly used in neuroscience, such as frequency, impulse, and step inputs. We then outline an iterative approach to perturbation input design. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating perturbation inputs significantly improves system identification accuracy as dictated by the objective function. Moreover, perturbation inputs tuned to a parameter related to the eigenvalues and a network structure of the intrinsic model enhance system identification. Through this iterative approach, the estimated model matrix gradually approaches the true matrix. As an application, we confirmed that the framework also contributes to the optimal control theory. This study highlights the potential of designing perturbation inputs to achieve the advanced identification of neural dynamics. By providing a framework for optimizing perturbations, our work facilitates deeper insights into brain functions and advances in the study of complex neural systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

For example, Jurkat leukemic T cells fundamentally contributed to uncovering T cell signaling, activation, and immune responses. However, the immortalization process can alter key cellular properties, and researchers widely believe this process could significantly change RNA modification machinery and modification sites. In this study, we focus on pseudouridine ({psi}), one of the most abundant mRNA modifications, and compare {psi} profiles in mRNA from primary and immortalized T cells using direct RNA sequencing (DRS). Surprisingly, 87% of {psi}-sites were shared between the two cell types, primarily in transcripts encoding proteins involved in essential cellular processes, including RNA-modification regulation. Furthermore, the analysis of the 13% of sites unique to each cell type reveals that Jurkat cells contained transcripts linked to immune activation and oncogenesis, while primary T cells contained transcripts associated with calcium signaling and intracellular trafficking. We provide a list of these genes, which should be considered when using immortalized cells to study RNA modifications in immunology contexts. Most differences were driven by whether the mRNA was present or absent in the immortalized or primary cell type. Interestingly, RNA-modification enzyme expression levels were highly conserved in both cell types. This suggests that site-specific differences in {psi} levels arise from regulatory processes acting in trans rather than differences in modification enzyme levels.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

In the most extreme case, a gene can be essential for viability in one genetic background, but dispensable in another. Although genetic context-dependency of mutant phenotypes is frequently observed, the underlying causes often remain elusive. Here, we investigated the genetic changes responsible for differences in gene essentiality across 18 genetically diverse natural yeast strains. First, we identified 39 genes that were essential in the laboratory reference strain but not required for viability in at least one other genetic background, suggesting that the natural strain contained suppressor variants that could bypass the need for the essential gene. We then mapped and validated the causal bypass suppressor variants using bulk segregant analysis and allele replacements. Bypass suppression was generally driven by a single modifier gene that tended to differ between genetic backgrounds. The suppressors often indirectly counteracted the effect of deleting the essential gene, for instance by changing the transcriptome of a cell. Context-dependent essential genes and their bypass suppressors were frequently co-mutated across 1,011 yeast isolates and identified naturally occurring evolutionary trajectories. Overall, our results highlight the relatively high frequency of bypass suppression in natural populations, as well as the underlying variants and mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the causes of genetic background effects is crucial for the interpretation of genotype-to-phenotype relationships, including those associated with human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Despite these insights, fundamental questions remain regarding how DRN neurons process sensory information, what do DRN communicate to forebrain, and the role of DRN inputs in forebrain computations and animal behavior.To address these questions, we investigated the spatiotemporal activity patterns of DRN neurons, along with DRN axons and their targets in the juvenile zebrafish forebrain. Our findings revealed a remarkable topographic organization of ongoing activity and sensory-motor responses within the DRN. We discovered that a large fraction of DRN neurons are primarily driven by animals locomotor activity. We also observed that an anterior group of DRN neurons, marked by Gad1, exhibited distinct activity patterns during rest, locomotor activity and sensory stimulation. DRN axons broadly innervating the forebrain exhibit topographically organized excitation and inhibition in response to sensory stimulation and motor activity. Notably, we observed significant and rapid covariation between the activity of DRN axons and nearby forebrain neurons. Chemogenetic ablation of the DRN led to a marked reduction in the synchrony and sensory-motor responses across forebrain neurons, accompanied by significant deficits in adaptive behaviors.

Yet to date, the mechanism of HGT among eukaryotes has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that Starships, a newly discovered group of cargo-mobilizing transposable elements, are active vectors of horizontally transferred DNA among eukaryotic species. We find that multiple Starships simultaneously transfer themselves and their cargo within and between fungal genera separated by upwards of 100 million years of evolution. Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of the Hephaestus Starship into a new species increases metal resistance due to the genes carried by this element. Between 18-27% of all Starships in our focal genus, Paecilomyces, have evidence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, including to other fungal genera, revealing Starship-mediated HGT to be a widespread and frequent phenomenon across filamentous fungi. This study identifies the first active genetic mechanism for HGT between eukaryotic species.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Here, we aimed to elucidate the extent of glycolysis dependence in AML by focusing on the role of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), a key glycolytic enzyme converting pyruvate to lactate coupled with the recycling of NAD+. We compared the glycolytic activity of primary AML patient samples to protein levels of metabolic enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism including glycolysis, glutaminolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting glycolysis in AML, we treated AML primary patient samples and cell lines with pharmacological inhibitors of LDHA and monitored cell viability. Glycolytic activity and mitochondrial oxygen consumption were analyzed in AML patient samples and cell lines post-LDHA inhibition. Perturbations in global metabolite levels and redox balance upon LDHA inhibition in AML cells were determined by mass spectrometry, and ROS levels were measured by flow cytometry. Among metabolic enzymes, we found that LDHA protein levels had the strongest positive correlation with glycolysis in AML patient cells. Blocking LDHA activity resulted in a strong growth inhibition and cell death induction in AML cell lines and primary patient samples, while healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells remained unaffected. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms showed that LDHA inhibition reduces glycolytic activity, lowers levels of glycolytic intermediates, decreases the cellular NAD+ pool, boosts OXPHOS activity and increases ROS levels. This increase in ROS levels was however not linked to the observed AML cell death. Instead, we found that LDHA is essential to maintain a correct NAD+/NADH ratio in AML cells. Continuous intracellular NAD+ supplementation via overexpression of water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis in AML cells effectively increased viable cell counts and prevented cell death upon LDHA inhibition. Collectively, our results demonstrate that AML cells critically depend on LDHA to maintain an adequate NAD+/NADH balance in support of their abnormal glycolytic activity and biosynthetic demands, which cannot be compensated for by other cellular NAD+ recycling systems. These findings also highlight LDHA inhibition as a promising metabolic strategy to eradicate leukemic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Despite its suggested high genetic and morphological diversity, key aspects such as nuclear DNA (nuDNA) population structure and relationship between body color patterns and genetic populations remain unclear. To address these gaps, this study analyzed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nuDNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) markers in samples from Hokkaido to the Tokara Islands, Japan. Admixture analysis identified five distinct populations with significant geographic boundaries. These populations exhibited unique geographical patterns, spanning across islands and enclave distribution, indicating that G. dehaani populations have been shaped by complex factors, including sea level changes and volcanic activity. Regional body color variations partially aligned with SNP clades. Further, combining body color with collection locality data could help identify the specimen populations. Contrasting patterns between mtDNA and nuDNA suggest historical gene flow and adaptive introgression, emphasizing the need for caution when interpreting earlier phylogenetic studies based on combined mtDNA and nuDNA sequences. Our findings provide a foundational baseline for future research into the taxonomy, phylogeny, and population dynamics of the G. dehaani species complex, advancing our understanding of its evolutionary history.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Despite established links between the infant gut microbiome and health, knowledge is limited for how complementary feeding influences colonization. Using FoodSeq, an objective DNA-based dietary assessment technique, we analyzed 1,036 fecal samples from 729 children aged 0-3 years across countries in North America, Central America, Africa, and Asia. We detected a wide diversity of 199 unique plant food sequences, of which only eight staple foods were consistently present across all countries. Despite this variation in global diet, we identified universal trajectories in early life dietary exposure: weaning stage, which tracked with dietary diversity, emerged as the dominant dietary signature across populations. Still, dietary diversity did not correlate with gut microbial diversity. Instead, dietary diversity and weaning stage specifically predicted the abundance of adult-like bacterial taxa, including known fiber-degrading taxa, which colonized after age 1. Our findings support a two-stage model of microbiome maturation: an early phase dominated by milk-adapted taxa independent of complementary feeding, followed by a maturation phase where diet shapes adult-like microbiota colonization. This model suggests that tracking and promoting plant dietary diversity may support the timely emergence of an adult-like microbiome.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

This barrier is heavily glycosylated by O-linked sugars covalently linked to mucin glycoproteins, and N-linked sugars that coat epithelial surface proteins. Gut O- and N-glycans are thought to play central roles in barrier function, host defense, nutrition and attachment for commensals and pathogens, immunoregulation and cell-cell interactions. However, the precise nature of the glycans and how glycan composition changes through development, as a function of diet, and during inflammation, remains incompletely understood. Here, we apply O- and N-glycomic platforms to profile glycans on mucus and intestinal epithelium. By mapping individual glycan species spatially and temporally we identify 57 O- and 18 N-glycans in the mouse intestine, and observe that fucosylation and sialylation varies according to intestinal region and developmental stage. We identify a subset of glycans regulated by the gut microbiome, and observe a constriction of the glycan repertoire during inflammation in both mice and humans. Together, these results provide an atlas of individual intestinal glycans and their dynamic range through ontogeny and inflammation, and represent a significant resource for our understanding of the role of intestinal glycans in health and disease and glycan-focused therapies for intestinal inflammation and shaping the gut microbiome.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Here, we leverage image-based spatial transcriptomics at sub-cellular resolution in longitudinal human cardiac biopsies to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in 62 adult and pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients during and following histologically-diagnosed rejection. Across 28 cell types, we identified significant differences in abundance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells across different biological classes of rejection (cellular, mixed, antibody-mediated). We observed a broad overlap in cellular transcriptional states across histologic rejection severity and biological class and significant heterogeneity within rejection severity grades that would qualify for immunomodulatory treatment. Individuals who had resolved rejection after therapy had a distinct transcriptomic profile relative to those with persistent rejection, including 216 genes across 6 cell types along pathways of inflammation, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, IFN/IFN{gamma} response, and TNF signaling. Spatial transcriptomics also identified genes linked to long-term prognostic outcomes post-HT. These results underscore importance of subtyping immunologic states during rejection to stratify immune-cardiac interactions following HT that are therapeutically relevant to short- and long-term rejection-related outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

This predilection introduces a major behavior bias that is known as reference-point dependence in Prospect Theory, and that has close links to mental accounting. Here we examined neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) of macaques performing a token-based risky choice task, in which the acquisition of 6 tokens (accumulated over several trials) resulted in a jackpot reward. We find that subjects make faster and more accurate choices as the jackpot reward becomes more likely to be achieved, suboptimal behavior that can readily be explained by reference dependence. This biased behavior systematically covaries with the neural encoding of corresponding offer values. Moreover, we found significant enhancement in speed, accuracy and neural encoding strength for easier levels of difficulty in detecting the offer with the best expected value. These results suggest a neural basis of reference dependence biases in shaping decision-making behavior and highlight the critical role of value representations in dACC in driving those biases.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the isochorismate (IC) pathway is the primary route for pathogen-induced SA biosynthesis. First, the IC synthase (ICS) catalyzes the isomerization of chorismate to IC in chloroplasts. Second, the chloroplast-localized MATE transporter EDS5 appears to transport IC from chloroplasts to the cytosol. Cytosolic IC is then further converted to SA via the GH3 amino acid-conjugating enzyme PBS3. While this pathway is genetically well-characterized in A. thaliana, its evolutionary origin and conservation remain controversial. In this study, through comprehensive phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that the IC pathway emerged within the Brassicales order in a time span between the divergence of Carica papaya and Capparis spinosa. The evolution of the IC pathway was driven by three key adaptations during the time span: (1) enhancement of ICS activity, (2) neofunctionalization of EDS5 after duplication of its ancestral gene, and (3) evolution of PBS3, whose activity is specialized for glutamate-conjugation to IC. Structural modeling and functional assays reveal that an enhanced salt bridge network in ICS enhanced its activity. One of the duplicated genes, EDS5, acquired key amino acid substitutions in the C-lobe, which likely contributed to the new function as the IC transporter. In addition, the functional PBS3 clade, including A. thaliana PBS3, is restricted to a Brassicales clade. Taken together, this study addresses the evolutionary trajectory of IC-based SA biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Their compact size makes them ideal for space-limited environments, controlled growth chambers, speed breeding, ornamental horticulture, and urban horticulture. To validate their potential for gene editing, in vitro regeneration experiments were performed on a medium containing zeatin riboside. Regeneration was similar to parental S. melongena (1.2 shoots/explant), with Micro-Mel developing 1.0 and Mini-Mel 0.8. Whole-genome sequencing (23X coverage) identified 179,653 SNPs between the parental lines, revealing heterozygosity rates of 0.00098% for Micro-Mel and 0.00123% in Mini-Mel.

Phylogeographic methods can reconstruct historical patterns of disease dissemination by combining the evolutionary history of sampled pathogen genomes with geographic information. Despite a substantial expansion of pathogen genomics during and since the COVID-19 pandemic, only a small fraction of infections are typically sampled and sequenced, leading to an underestimation of the true intensity of viral importation. Here, we seek to understand the sampling processes underlying this underestimation. We show that the coupling of viral importation and local transmission dynamics can result in local transmission lineages with different size distributions, influencing the probability that individual viral importation events will be detected. Using analytical and simulation approaches, we demonstrate that both the proportion of importation events detected and the temporal patterns of inferred importation are highly sensitive to importation dynamics and local transmission parameters. Our findings highlight the importance of interpreting phylogeographic estimates in the context of outbreak conditions, particularly when comparing viral movements across time and among different epidemic settings. These insights are critical for improving the reliability of genomic epidemiology approaches in the design of public health responses.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

Expression of the aexB gene is positively regulated by the transcription factor AerB, that is normally normally inactive. Selective pressure by photo-leucine triggered the acqusition of a point mutation in aerB, allowing AerB to activate aexB expression. Mutants highly resistant to photo-leucine carried a single amino acid exchange, Ala-494 to Thr, in the leucine-tRNA synthetase LeuS. Molecular docking analysis revealed that this mutation alters the leucine-binding pocket, in a manner that still allowed binding of leucine, but not photo-leucine. While high photo-leucine incorporation is beneficial for effective crosslinking, our results suggest that B. subtilis intrinsically limits its incorporation to maintain cellular tolerance. Thus, evolutionary processes provide adaptive mechanisms to adjust amino acid analogue incorporation to tolerable levels, making photo amino acids a candidate for life cell investigation of protein struture and interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Determining the timing of these influences across the lifespan is a key challenge. Here we test what makes genetically identical brains differ and converge. Mono- (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins (n = 206, age 16-79 yrs) with known extent of birth weight (BW) discordance, had MRIs pre- and post- 10 weeks immersive virtual reality navigation training in a train-rest-rest/rest-train-rest-design, or as passive controls. As a measure of between-twin similarity, we calculated ""brainprints"" from 272 structural cortical features, to assess effects of genetic (MZ/DZ) and environmental variation at early (BW discordance) and later life stages (training status). Baseline brainprint similarity was higher in MZ than DZ twins, but greater BW discordance yielded less similarity in MZ (r = -.54, p < .0001), dominated by cortical area effects (t = -6.748, p < .0001). In contrast, training increased brainprint similarity of MZ relative to DZ twins (zygosity x training; t = -2.864, p =.0046), mostly by cortical curvature (t = -4.401, p<.0001). Follow-up analyses indicated training increased white matter curvature and surface area. The findings demonstrate that in adulthood, early life environmental difference persistently contributes to make the brains of genetically identical twins deviate, while concurrent environmental influence in the form of training still can cause their brainprints to converge at the grey-white-matter boundary. This indicates how these early and later environmental influences on the cortex can be distinguished, and how cortical characteristics can be modified.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

This study investigates the Bermin crater lake species flock in Cameroon, comprising thirteen (nine valid and four undescribed) Coptodon species, to explore the effects of deep-water light environments on visual evolution. We analyzed visual opsin genes and their expression using 109 retina transcriptomes, focusing on differences among species at varying depths, and seasonal changes in the visual system of a seasonally migrating species. All species exhibit a multichromatic system with at least five cone opsins. While opsin sequence variability among species was minimal due to the flock's evolutionary youth, opsin expression patterns varied significantly. Deep-water species showed reduced SWS1 and SWS2B expression, consistent with diminished UV-to-violet light in deeper waters. Unexpectedly, we observed increased proportional expression of the red-sensitive LWS opsin gene, contrary to trends seen in other lacustrine fishes. Additionally, in the seasonally deep-dwelling species Coptodon imbriferna, opsin expression varied plastically between the rainy (shallow) and dry (deep) seasons, with reduced SWS2B expression when the fish reside in the deeper habitats. To add context of other cichlid systems and to explore shared patterns of molecular adaptation, we compared Bermin cichlids to the deep-water species of the Barombi Mbo crater lake. Both cases exemplify independent evolution of deep-water species, yet their visual systems adapted similarly in the single cones (less UV- and violet-sensitive and more blue-sensitive cones), whereas differently in the long-wavelength sensitive double cones (LWS expression lost in Barombi while increased in Bermin). Overall, our study focuses on an evolutionarily young example of cichlid adaptive radiation, providing a unique opportunity to examine the initial phases of molecular adaptation in visual systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

In human adults, visual performance declines with eccentricity and varies around polar angle for many visual dimensions and tasks: Performance is superior along the horizontal than the vertical meridian (horizontal-vertical anisotropy, HVA), and along the lower than the upper vertical meridian (vertical meridian asymmetry, VMA)(Carrasco et al., 2001). However, it remains unknown whether visual adaptation differs around polar angle. In this study, we investigated adaptation effects at the fovea and perifovea across the four cardinal locations, for horizontal and vertical adaptor and target orientations, with stimulus size adjusted as per a cortical magnification factor (Rovamo & Virsu, 1979). We measured contrast thresholds at each location separately for adaptation and non-adaptation conditions. Results confirmed the expected HVA and VMA effects in non-adapted conditions and showed they are stronger for horizontal than vertical orientations. They also revealed that, for both orientations, adaptation effects are stronger along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, which in turn is stronger than at the fovea. Furthermore, for both orientations, individual's adaptation effects at the perifoveal locations positively correlated with their cortical surface area of V1. The association of a stronger adaptation effect with larger V1 surface area suggests a more pronounced conservation of bioenergetic resources along the horizontal than the vertical meridian. Visual adaptation alleviates the HVA in contrast sensitivity, promoting a more homogeneous perception around the visual field.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Y596 enables HscA to penetrate the phagosomal membrane. In line, the introduction of a single L-to-Y exchange in the orthologous Ssb protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae enabled the protein to penetrate phagosomal membranes that was reduced by deletion of one of the two Y-encoding SSB genes in the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata. These data suggest a convergent evolution of HscA/Ssb proteins among human-pathogenic fungi and that a single amino acid exchange determines a virulence factor.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

However, there is an ongoing need for novel TCM preparations. The aim of this study was to assess the potential and mechanism of a de novo designed TCM preparation: JinHuangJieDu (JHJD), which is composed of JIN YIN HUA, HUANG QIN, GUANG HUO XIANG, BAI ZHI, PU GONG YING and BO HE, for the treatment of COVID-19 using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro experimental validations. Methods: First, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to validate whether JHJD inhibits the binding of wild type and mutant receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by JHJD was assessed with pseudovirus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and COS7-hACE2 cells. Network pharmacology analysis using Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional Medicine (ETCM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases (TCMSP) were further performed to identify the meridional network, active ingredients and targeted genes of JHJD. Interaction networks were constructed and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were performed using Cytoscape (3.7.1) software with ClueGO and CluePedia plugins. Vital genes were identified using CytoHubba and MCODE plugins. In vitro experiments were performed to confirm one of the targeted crucial gene and to validate whether JHJD may mitigate inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results: JHJD effectively blocked the binding of both wild type and Omicron RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 and completely inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to ACE2-positive host cells in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis uncovered that JHJD comprises a total of 378 active ingredients and 339 targeted genes, with its primary actions likely focused on lung, stomach and spleen. A total of 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, predominantly related to viral infection and inflammation pathways. Two pivotal genes, CCND1 and HIF1A, were identified by intersecting the MCODE module genes with different node algorithms in CytoHubba. In vitro validation confirmed that JHJD could target HIF-1, reducing virus-induced inflammation, which may potentially mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a de novo designed TCM JHJD could effectively inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through blocking of the interaction between RBD and ACE2. The inhibitory effect appears to be particularly potent against Omicron variants, as JHJD demonstrated enhanced efficacy in inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interaction for several Omicron variants. Furthermore, JHJD could mitigate the virus-induced inflammation by targeting HIF-1. Collectively, this study suggested that JHJD preparation holds promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19, as it not only inhibits the viral entry into host cells but also reduces the inflammatory responses triggered by the infection.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

They also represent a complex ecosystem as intricate holobionts made up of microbes from all domains of the Tree of Life, where many play significant roles in host health and fitness [4]. The corallicolids are a clade of apicomplexans that infect a wide variety of anthozoans across the world, and have been shown to influence the thermal tolerance of habitat-forming corals [1, 5]. Despite their potentially important impacts on reef ecosystems, much of the basic biology and ecology of corallicolids remains unclear. Apicomplexans often have a closed life cycle, with minimal environmental exposure, and sometimes multiple hosts. Corallicolids have only been documented in anthozoan hosts, with no known secondary/reservoir hosts or vectors [6]. Here, we show that abundant corallicolid sequences are recovered from bearded fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in tropical reef habitats off Curacao, and that they are distinct from corallicolids infecting the corals on which the fireworms were feeding at the time of their collection. The data are consistent with an active infection of fireworms, as opposed to corallicolids being a byproduct of feeding on infected corals, and we propose that H. carunculata is potentially a vector moving corallicolids between coral hosts through its faeces. These findings not only expand our understanding of the ecological interactions within coral reef ecosystems but also highlight the potential role of host-associated parasites in shaping the resilience of reef habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data. Distantly related genetic clones in the peritoneum express the lipid metabolism program, likely due to signaling by the adipocyte-rich peritoneum environment, and cells in most clones express multiple programs, suggesting that transcriptomic plasticity is a prevalent feature of metastatic cells. These deeply annotated analyses using a patient-centric platform provide a model for investigating metastatic mechanisms and plasticity in advanced cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

We examine the differences in phylogenetic signal between a continuous trait partition, a discrete trait partition, and a joint analysis with both types of characters. We find that continuous and discrete traits contribute substantially different signal to the analysis, even when other parts of the model (clock and tree) are held constant. Tree topologies resulting from the new analyses differ strongly from the established phylogeny for dicynodonts, highlighting continued difficulty in incorporating truly continuous data in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

The evolutionary association of mobile elements with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with mobile elements lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help overcome these barriers, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration in between bacterial populations favours this linkage when the gene is beneficial in an environment where prophage induction is also upregulated. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages. Here, virion dispersal allows phage-encoded genes to spread into patches of bacteria lacking the gene, giving them a selective advantage over immobile chromosomal genes. While both of these mechanisms are evidently applicable to phages, this is less clear for plasmids and other mobile elements. This helps to resolve the long-standing question of why phages, rather than other mobile genetic elements, appear to frequently carry virulence genes as cargo. By demonstrating how spatial heterogeneity and phage lifecycle dynamics drive gene association, our work provides new insights into the evolution of phage-encoded pathogenicity and bacterial adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

However, concerns remain that increased telehealth availability may contribute to higher overall healthcare utilization and spending. To assess telehealth's impact on outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visit volume, we compared overall E&M utilization before and after the pandemic across specialties with varying levels of telehealth use. Methods: We analyzed 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims to compare monthly outpatient E&M visit rates between two periods: pre-pandemic (January 2019-February 2020) and post-pandemic (January 2021-June 2024). Specialties were categorized by telehealth use as high (behavioral health), medium (primary care), and low (orthopedic surgery). A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to assess changes in visit volume associated with telehealth. Results: Prior to the pandemic, telehealth accounted for just 0.1% of monthly E&M visits but surged to 41.0% in April 2020 before stabilizing between 5.7% and 7.0% in 2023-2024. The average monthly E&M visit rate per 1,000 FFS beneficiaries was 906.8 pre-pandemic and 918.6 post-pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, telehealth comprised 1.2% of E&M visits in low-use specialties, 8.4% in medium-use specialties, and 43.8% in high-use specialties. Compared to the expected trend based on the low telehealth-use specialty, high and medium telehealth-use specialties experienced a 4.1% and 7.2% relative decline in overall E&M visits, respectively, in the post-pandemic period. Conclusion: Following an initial surge, telehealth use stabilized in 2021 and beyond. Overall outpatient utilization remained stable post-pandemic, and increased telehealth adoption was not associated with a rise in total outpatient E&M visits. These findings suggest that broad telehealth adoption has not led to increased healthcare utilization among Medicare FFS beneficiaries.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

Exposure(s)Comparison of index visits initiated by telehealth versus in-person visits.

Primary outcomeAdjusted 30-day total spending.

Secondary outcomes30-day rates of return visits, laboratory tests, and imaging.

ResultsThe study included 30,079,958 participants with 36,709,528 and 429,891,125 episodes initiated by telehealth and in-person visits, respectively. The mean age was 76 for telehealth and 75 years for in-person. Telehealth-initiated visits were associated with lower 30-day spending ($260 vs. $342; net: -$82), though return visit rates were higher for telehealth (16.1% vs. 14.1%). Both lab test rates (7.8% vs. 24.2%) and imaging rates (3.5% vs 7.8%) were lower for telehealth-initiated care episodes compared to in-person-initiated care episodes.

Conclusions and RelevanceTelehealth-initiated episodes of care were associated with lower 30-day Medicare spending and reduced utilization of labs and imaging. These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

To address these obstacles, we present the DASH assembly toolset, which combines features of Golden Gate-based cloning, recombineering, and site-specific recombinase systems. We developed (1) a set of donor vectors based on the GoldenBraid platform, (2) an acceptor vector derived from the plant transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, and (3) a re-engineered recombineering-ready E. coli strain, CZ105, based on SW105. The initial assembly steps are carried out using the donor vectors following standard GoldenBraid assembly procedures. Importantly, existing parts and transcriptional units created using compatible Golden Gate-based systems can be transferred to the DASH donor vectors using standard single-tube restriction/ligation reactions. The cargo DNA from a DASH donor vector is then efficiently transferred in vivo in E. coli into the acceptor vector by the sequential action of a rhamnose-inducible phage-derived PhiC31 integrase and arabinose-inducible yeast-derived Flippase (FLP) recombinase using CZ105. Furthermore, recombineering-based post-assembly modification, including the removal of undesirable scars, is greatly simplified. To demonstrate the utility of the DASH system, a 116 kb DNA construct harboring a 97 kb cargo consisting of 35 transcriptional units was generated. One of the CDSs in the final assembly was replaced through recombineering, and the in planta functionality of the entire construct was tested in both transient and stable transformants.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Methods: We used weighted data from the YRBS for 2011-2023 (n=110,409). We explored the impact of declining school and student response rates, missing data, and shifts in age distribution in 2021 on reported sexual intercourse. Using statistical decomposition, we estimated the percentage change in this outcome between 2019 and 2021 due to change in the age structure versus changes in reported behavior. Results: From 2011 and 2023, school and student survey response rates declined (school 81% to 40%, student 87% to 71%, and overall, 71% to 35%). Missing data on ever had sex increased over time from 7.0% in 2011 to 29.5% in 2019 and 19.8% in 2023. The age structure in the YRBS national sample was similar from 2011-2019 and in 2023, but substantially younger in 2021. Statistical decomposition estimated that 50% of the change in sexual experience among adolescent women between 2019 and 2021 and 30% of the change for adolescent men was due to a change in the age distribution. Implications: Declining response rates, increased missing data, and changes in the age structure of 2021 YRBS raise serious concerns about the validity of trends in the YRBS. A concerted national effort is needed to build support for the collection of YRBS and other public health surveillance data.","NA","medrxiv",1741644522142

Here, we uncover a mechanism for developmental regulation of nuclear migration directionality. The nuclear envelope KASH protein UNC-83 in Caenorhabditis elegans exists in multiple isoforms that differentially control motor activity. The shorter UNC-83c isoform promotes kinesin-1-dependent nuclear movement in embryonic hyp7 precursors, while longer UNC-83a/b isoforms facilitate dynein-mediated nuclear migration in larval P cells. We demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of UNC-83a functions as a kinesin-1 inhibitory module by directly binding kinesin heavy chain (UNC-116). This isoform-specific inhibition, combined with differential affinity for kinesin light chain (KLC-2), establishes a molecular switch for directional control. Together, these interdisciplinary studies reveal how alternative isoforms of cargo adaptors can generate developmental stage-specific regulation of motor activity during development.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

However, the resulting digestate remains underutilized and its long-term environmental impact is uncertain. Traditional disposal methods are costly and inefficient, underscoring the need for more sustainable approaches. In this study, olive pomace digestate was biorefined and its components were upcycled into soil amendments and plant immunostimulants. Metagenomic analysis revealed a diverse microbial community in the liquid fraction, including Luteimonas, Pseudomonas, and Caldicoprobacter. We obtained a MIcrobial Protein Extract (MIPE) from digestate, containing precursors of microbe- and damage-associated molecular patterns. Treatment with MIPE triggered a rapid plant immune response, characterized by increased hydrogen peroxide production, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the upregulation of defense-related genes. MIPE-induced priming enhanced Arabidopsis and tomato resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae. Our findings highlight digestate as a source of bioelicitors, offering a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides while enhancing plant immunity, valorizing olive mill waste and promoting sustainable agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to investigate the effects of pro-proliferative signaling on epithelial homeostasis using the Drosophila follicle cell lineage. Notably, EGFR-Ras overactivation induces cell cycle defects by activating the transcription factors Pointed and E2f1 and impedes differentiation. Hh signaling simultaneously promotes an undifferentiated state and induces differentiation via activation of EMT-associated transcription factors zfh1 and Mef2. As a result, overactivation of Hh signaling generates a transcriptional hybrid state comparable to epithelial-mesenchymal-transition. Co-overactivation of Hh signaling with EGFR-Ras signaling blocks differentiation and induces key characteristics of tumor cells including a loss of tissue architecture caused by reduced expression of cell adhesion molecules, sustained proliferation and an evasion of cell cycle checkpoints. These findings provide new insight into how non-interacting signaling pathways converge at the transcriptional level to prevent malignant cell behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

TBCK-Encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by stop-gain variants in the TBCK gene. Clinically, patients show evidence of profound neurodevelopmental delays, but also symptoms of progressive encephalopathy and motor neuron disease. Yet, the physiological role of TBCK protein remains unclear. We report a human neuronal TBCKE model, derived from iPSCs homozygous for the Boricua variant (p.R126X). Using unbiased proteomic analyses of human neurons, we find TBCK interacts with PPP1R21, C12orf4, and Cryzl1, consistent with TBCK being part of the FERRY mRNA transport complex. Loss of TBCK leads to depletion of C12ORF4 protein levels across multiple cell types, suggesting TBCK may also play a role regulating at least some members of the FERRY complex. We find that TBCK preferentially, but not exclusively, localizes to the surface of endolysosomal vesicles and can colocalize with mRNA in lysosomes. Furthermore, TBCK-deficient neurons have reduced mRNA content in the axonal compartment relative to the soma. TBCK-deficient neurons show reduced levels of the lysosomal dynein/dynactin adapter protein JIP4, which functionally leads to TBCK-deficient neurons exhibiting striking lysosomal axonal retrograde trafficking defects. Hence, our work reveals that TBCK can mediate endolysosomal trafficking of mRNA, particularly along lysosomes in human axonal compartments. TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in neurons, which likely contribute to the preferential susceptibility to neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

This flexibility relies on network interactions encompassing premotor and prefrontal regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). However, the dynamic interplay between these regions during action preparation and execution based on contextual demands remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that contextual information is encoded in SMA and rIFG interareal connectivity before action. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) during Go/No-Go tasks with varying target probabilities, we found that, during the preparatory stages of action, -band rIFG connectivity increased in contexts where motor responses were more frequently withheld. In contrast, SMA exhibited a reversed pattern only near the target onset. Finally, {beta}-band connectivity encoded proactive inhibition processes, increasing when action likelihood was low. Accordingly, during response implementation, both areas exhibited greater {beta}-band connectivity when action was withheld compared to when a motor response was required, further supporting its role in inhibitory control. Our results demonstrate that - and {beta}-band oscillatory network dynamics support context-sensitive adaptations, illustrating how premotor and prefrontal regions synergistically modulate their interactions as they transition from preparation to response. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates predictive information to dynamically organize motor and cognitive resources before an action unfolds, revealing that connectivity encodes critical information driving behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522142

Mitochondria and plastids evolved from bacteria and therefore also use prokaryotic-type expression machineries to synthesize proteins. However, fungi and animal mitochondria are highly sensitive to mistranslation, which for instance manifests in lethal mitochondrial cardiomyopathy disorder. The response in plant cells is unknown. Glutaminyl-transferRNAs (Gln-tRNAGln) of bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids are synthesized indirectly. Initially, tRNAGln gets charged with glutamate. Subsequently, Gln is produced through trans-amidation by the aminoacyl-tRNA amido-transferase complex GatCAB. Consequentially, affected GatCAB activity results in pools of misloaded Glu-tRNAGln. Here we show that Arabidopsis mutants with decreased GatCAB level provide global insights into organellar mistranslation in plants. Proteomics revealed Gln-to-Glu misincorporation in plastid- and mitochondrially-expressed protein complexes with only modest abundance changes in mutant plants. Plastids appear more lenient to mistranslation as they exhibit much higher Gln-to-Glu misincorporation. Through efficient compensatory mechanisms, mutant plants display surprisingly subtle phenotypes. However, their acclimation to temperature stress differs. Interestingly, wild-type plants under similar stress also have altered Gln-to-Glu misincorporation. Our study shows that the response towards organellar mistranslation varies among eukaryotes.

This gap limits our ability to probe fully how proteins undergo phase transitions in response to temperature changes. Here, we introduce Mpipi-T, a residue-level coarse-grained model designed to predict LCST-type phase behavior of proteins.

Accordingly, Mpipi-T predicts temperature-driven protein behavior quantitatively in both single- and multi-chain systems.

Small population sizes and the lack of recombination are two such scenarios that reduce the efficiency of selection. Under these conditions, the disconnect between deleterious genetic load and individual fitness due to the masking of recessive deleterious mutations in heterozygous individuals may result in the emergence of pseudo-overdominance, wherein the buildup of haplotypes with complementary sets of deleterious mutations results in apparent heterozygote advantage and an increase in linked neutral diversity. In polyploids, the presence of additional allelic copies magnifies this masking effect and may therefore increase the probability of pseudo-overdominance. Here, we simulate the evolution of small diploid and autotetraploid populations to identify the conditions that support the evolution of pseudo-overdominance. We discover that pseudo-overdominance evolves under a much wider range of parameters in autotetraploids than in diploids with identical population sizes, and that in many parts of parameter space there is an inverse relationship between fitness and recombination rate. These results imply that pseudo-overdominance may be more common than previously thought. We conclude by discussing the current evidence for pseudo-overdominance in species with polyploid histories, as well as its implications in agriculture due to the prevalence of polyploidy in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522143

In former Roman territories, their emergence has traditionally been linked to mass migrations from outside the Roman Empire. However, recent studies have emphasised local continuity with some individual-level mobility. We generated and analysed 248 historic genomes from Late Roman (3rd and 4th century CE) and Early Medieval (5th-8th century CE) burial sites in southern Germany, comparing them to over 2,500 contemporary and Iron Age genomes in addition to 1,344 modern-day genomes from Germany, Italy and Great-Britain. Despite small inferred Early Medieval period community sizes, genetic diversity exceeded that of modern German cities. In the Altheim graveyard, established in the 5th century by a group of Northern European descent, we inferred a demographic shift in the 6th century with the integration of newcomers with ancestry typical of a nearby Roman military camp, likely as a result of the collapse of Roman state structures. We reconstructed multigenerational pedigrees and, using a novel approach to infer ancestry of unsampled relatives, inferred immediate intermarriage between incoming and local groups, with a distinct tendency for men from former Roman background marrying women of northern descent. Burial proximity correlates strongly with kinship, in some cases spanning six generations. These communities were organized around small family units, exhibited loosely patrilineal or bilateral descent patterns, practiced reproductive monogamy, and avoided close-kin marriages. Such practices reflect broader transformations in family structures that began during the Late Roman period, were transferred to small agrarian societies in the Early Medieval period, and continued to shape European societies. By the 7th century, ongoing admixture had shaped genetic diversity patterns into those resembling Central Europe today.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522143

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule partitioning remain largely unknown. Here, we first exploit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of model condensates to elucidate physicochemical rules governing small-molecule partitioning. We find that while hydrophobicity is a major determinant, solubility becomes a stronger regulator of partitioning in more polar condensates. Additionally, more polar condensates exhibit selectivity toward certain compounds, suggesting that condensate-specific therapeutics can be engineered. Building on these insights, we develop minimal models (MAPPS) for efficient prediction of small-molecule partitioning into biologically relevant condensates. We demonstrate that this approach reproduces atomistic partition coefficients in both model systems and condensates composed of the low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS. Applying MAPPS to various LCD-based condensates shows that protein sequence can exert a selective pressure, thereby influencing small-molecule partitioning. Collectively, our findings reveal that partitioning is driven by both small-molecule--protein affinity and the complex interplay between the compounds and the condensate chemical environment.","NA","biorxiv",1741644522143
