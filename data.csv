DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719179

Building on recent research delineating a transdiagnostic neurodevelopmental spectrum, we examined longitudinal associations between this spectrum in late childhood and other psychiatric dimensions in early adolescence, and the role of environmental/lifestyle factors as potential mediators of these associations. Method: In 11,875 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we extracted neurodevelopmental, externalizing, internalizing, detachment, and somatoform dimensions at ages 10, 11, and 12 years through confirmatory factor analysis of Child Behavior Checklist items. Using linear mixed models, we tested prospective associations between the neurodevelopmental spectrum at age 10 and other psychiatric dimensions at ages 11 and 12. Mediation models examined whether environmental (e.g., family conflict, school involvement) and lifestyle (e.g., sleep problems, screen use) factors at age 11 mediated these associations. Results: Strong longitudinal associations emerged between the neurodevelopmental spectrum and all other psychiatric dimensions ({beta}=0.417-0.641, p<0.001). Sleep problems were the most consistent mediator, accounting for 12-29% of the associations with all outcomes. Most results remained significant after multiple testing corrections and adjusting for covariates, mediators, and outcomes at baseline. Conclusion: Our transdiagnostic dimensional approach revealed a wide range of poor dimensional psychiatric outcomes in children with high neurodevelopmental traits. Sleep problems emerged as a key lifestyle factor underlying these associations and promising target for transdiagnostic prevention programs to improve mental health outcomes in this population.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719179

It is estimated to affect one in ten people and can be extremely debilitating. With few publicly funded long Covid clinics, most people rely on primary care providers as a first point of contact. There is currently limited understanding of the experience of accessing primary health care by adults living with long Covid in New Zealand.    Purpose  To explore the experiences of accessing primary health care by adults living with long Covid.   Methods  A narrative inquiry approach was used to capture participants lived experiences of accessing primary health care. Zoom interviews and discussions were conducted with study participants. The automatically generated transcripts were reviewed and corrected and the collated data were analysed using Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis.   Results  Eighteen people participated in the interviews. Codes were identified and, through an iterative process, themes were generated, reviewed, and named. The seven themes included lack of upskilling of primary care staff; let down by the Government; self-advocacy and its cost; and throwing money at it.   Conclusion(s)  The picture painted by participants was bleak with a sense that the world had moved on from Covid-19 and left them behind, with some experiencing a lack of support in primary health care. Better support might be achieved through a public awareness campaign for improved delivery of credible information, and greater utilisation of the allied health workforce.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

ObjectivesTo evaluate the frequency and severity of autonomic dysfunction in a subset of carefully phenotyped, previously healthy patients with LC-POTS using a detailed protocol of autonomic, cerebrovascular, respiratory, blood, and tissue analyses.

MethodsParticipants in this study completed a battery of autonomic function tests including measures of sudomotor, cardiovagal, and sympathetic adrenergic function, and head-up tilt (HUT) with transcranial Doppler measures of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), cerebral and skeletal muscle near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and plasma catecholamines. Skin biopsy was performed at proximal and distal sites and analyzed for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (P-Syn). Results were compared to healthy controls (HC) [&ge;] 3 months post-COVID infection with no lasting sequelae.

ResultsLC-POTS participants (n=24) exhibited a greater increase in heart rate on HUT (31.1{+/-}20.3, p=0.01), and 38% exhibited elevated upright norepinephrine levels consistent with a hyperadrenergic response. CBFv did not significantly differ between LC-POTS and HC (n=10). EtCO2 and NIRS were also similar between groups. Twenty-two percent of LC-POTS and 38% of HC had decreased IENFD on skin biopsy, while 8.7% LC-POTS had dermal P-Syn aggregation on skin biopsy, compared to none of HC.

ConclusionsLC-POTS was associated with widespread autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic tachycardia, sympathetic adrenergic hyperactivity, small fiber neuropathy, and dermal P-Syn deposition. Our findings support the concept of multiple patholophysiological mechanisms in most patients with POTS triggered by SARS-CoV-2.

As a result, unlike in conventional microscopes, the point spread function (PSF) and optical transfer function (OTF) are tilted with respect to the optical axis of the imaging system. This suggests that a small sample-scanning step size is required to satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion. Recently, we have shown that a careful choice of apparent undersampling leads to aliased OTF copies that can be separated and stitched together in Fourier space to form a properly sampled OTF. In our demonstrations, this led to acquisition speed gains of between two- and four-fold. Here, we introduce a deconvolution-based method to reconstruct properly sampled volumes from apparently undersampled datasets that outperforms our previous Fourier-stitching approach.","NA","biorxiv",1746223719180

There is incomplete understanding of the impact of genetic variation on gene expression in the human retina, and its role in genetic disorders. Through the generation of whole genome sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing of neurosensory retina (NSR) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) from 201 post-mortem eyes, we uncovered common and rare genetic variants shaping retinal expression profiles. This includes 1,483,595 significant cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) impacting 9,959 and 3,699 genes in NSR and RPE, respectively, with associated genetic variants enriched to cis-candidate regulatory elements and notable shared eGenes between NSR and RPE. We also detected 1051 expression outliers and prioritised 299 rare non-coding single-nucleotide, structural variants or copy number variants as plausible drivers for 28% of outlier events. This study increases understanding of gene expression regulation in the human retina.

Cortical structure is highly heritable, but whether heritability varies across socioeconomic status (SES) is unknown. In this preregistered study, we estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability of cortical thickness, surface area, sulcal depth, and grey-/white-matter contrast (GWC) among 9,080 US 10-year-olds. We then tested whether genetic and environmental influences were moderated by parental SES, defined as a composite of income, education, and neighbourhood deprivation. Cortical thickness and surface area showed high heritability, while sulcal depth and GWC exhibited moderate heritability. However, among children from lower-SES backgrounds, cortical differences were less genetically influenced and more influenced by unique environmental factors, at times exceeding genetic contributions. These findings suggest that in contexts of socioeconomic disadvantage, children's brain structure reflect lived experience more strongly than previously recognized.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

While numerous studies have established substantial genetic contribution for LOAD, the interpretation of heritability estimates remains challenging. These challenges are further complicated by the binary nature of LOAD status, where estimation and interpretation require additional considerations. Through a systematic review, we identified LOAD heritability estimates from 6 twin studies and 17 genome-wide association studies, all conducted in populations of European ancestry. We demonstrate that these heritability estimates for LOAD vary considerably. The variation reflects not only differences in study design and methodological approaches but also the underlying study population characteristics.

There is broad consensus regarding the necessity to optimise the preservation of the tree of life by including evolutionary information in conservation prioritisation, a notion also endorsed by major policy frameworks. However, evolutionarily-informed prioritisations are lacking for most plants, resulting in a taxonomic imbalance in the evolutionary information incorporated in global biodiversity analyses, which has undermined conservation for decades. Here, we use comprehensive species-level phylogenetic trees, and extinction risk estimates, to generate the first global assessment of angiosperm evolutionary history at risk, and to identify phylogenetically-informed conservation priorities for the world's flowering plants. We estimate that more than one fifth of angiosperm evolutionary history is at risk of extinction in the short term. Using the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered approach, we identify 9,945 threatened plant species that disproportionately account for total evolutionary history at risk. Species and area prioritisations incorporating evolutionary history are urgently needed to correct imbalances between plants and animals, monitor the effectiveness of conservation efforts, and optimise conservation resource allocation in the face of increasing human pressures on Earth's biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1746223719180

MethodsA rapid review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. Searches were completed in June 2024 and included MEDLINE, Embase, American Psychological Association (APA) PsycINFO, evidence based medicine (EBM) Reviews (including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Health Management Information Consortium, Web of Science and Google Scholar. This review included studies on LC symptoms lasting over 12 weeks, focusing on 1) non-workplace- and workplace-based support for RTW in LC patients, and/or 2) barriers and facilitators to RTW in LC patients. A quality assessment was conducted using the JBI Systematic Reviews critical appraisal tool. The data were summarised in tabular format and a narrative summary. This study was pre-registered (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42023478126).

ResultsTwenty-five studies were included. While many studies demonstrated rigorous methodologies and low risk of bias levels, some had high and medium risk levels. Non-workplace-based support was mostly measured quantitatively and included interdisciplinary healthcare programmes, clinical interventions, and rehabilitation programmes focusing on pacing and breathing strategies. Compensation and insurance schemes were important funders of these interventions.

Workplace-based support was mostly measured qualitatively. Barriers to the provision of support at organisational level included lack of understanding of LC symptoms, insufficient workplace guidance, and educational gaps among managers. Individual barriers included threat of income loss, remote working and disconnection from the workplace. Facilitators for support included recognition and validation of LC and its symptoms, and eligibility for disability benefits associated with work.

ConclusionsRTW is an important outcome of health related absence and should be systematically recorded in studies of people with long COVID (PwLC). The heterogeneity and unpredictability of LC symptoms create challenges for supporting working age populations. Further research is crucial to better understand the specific RTW needs for PwLC and address potential barriers and facilitators to effective support. Consistent guidelines on LCs definition, and disability status may facilitate the provision of support and the development of interventions.

Its best-known strain is H5N1, with South- or South-East Asia a likely location for an initial outbreak. Such an outbreak would be initiated through a primary event of bird-to-human infection, followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Early interventions would require the extraction, integration and interpretation of epidemiological information from the limited and noisy case data available at outbreak onset.

MethodsWe studied the implications of a potential zoonotic spillover of H5N1 influenza into humans. Our simulations used BharatSim, an agent-based model framework designed primarily for the population of India, but which can be tuned easily for others. We considered a synthetic population representing farm-workers (primary contacts) in a farm with infected birds. These primary contacts transfer infections to secondary (household) contacts, from where the infection spreads further. We simulate outbreak scenarios in such a setting, accounting for the network structure of human contacts and the stochasticity of the infection process. We further simulated multiple interventions, including bird-culling, quarantines, and vaccinations.

FindingsWe show how limited, noisy data for primary and secondary infections can be used to estimate epidemiological transmission parameters, such as the basic reproductive ratio R0, in realistic settings. We describe the impact of early interventions (bird-culling, quarantines, and vaccination), taken together or separately, in slowing or terminating the outbreak.

InterpretationAn individual-based model allows for the most granular description of the bird-human spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission for the case of H5N1. Such models can be contextualised to individual communities across varied geographies, given representative contact networks. We show how such models allow for the systematic real-time exploration of policy measures that could constrain disease-spread, as well as guide a better understanding of disease epidemiology.

We identified studies that simulated pathogen transmission within realistic poultry production and distribution networks, but they did not use these simulations to estimate disease parameters. The available evidence suggesting the potential of zoonotic spillover of avian influenza supports the inclusion of such parameters into transmission models.

Added value of this studySouth- and South-East Asia have in recent years recorded a number of significant outbreaks of avian influenza in birds, accompanied by spillover events into non-poultry species. Within the past three months, India has recorded 34 epicentres of infection across 8 states, raising concerns about the possibility of a pandemic driven by an adaptation of the virus to infectious spread between humans. Our agent-based simulation framework can be used to tune policy measures for a potential outbreak of H5N1 influenza, as well as to calibrate both epidemiological parameters and the impact of interventions.

Implications of all the available evidenceApart from providing realistic models for the consecutive events of a bird-human spillover infection followed by human-human transmission for the case of H5N1 influenza, our models can describe the impact of a variety of policy measures aimed at stemming a potential HPAI-initiated pandemic in humans. These include bird culling, quarantines and vaccination drives. We show that that timing of such measures is crucial if they are at all to be effective: culling of infected birds and quarantining of primary contacts should happen well before the force of infection peaks.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

One possible solution is to use physicians who are quicker to train and more pervasive in lieu of more extensively trained physicians. Canada allows for emergency medicine specialization via a 3-year pathway (CCFP(EM)) and a 5-year pathway (FRCPC) which means different geographic areas are exposed to EM physicians with different training lengths. Methods We examine Ontario, Canada which has both widespread geographic diversity and emergency providers with these two lengths of postgraduate training. We scrape the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario public registry in 2015 and 2024. We map the geographic distribution of physician types and estimate spatial autocorrelation measures using global and local Morans I to determine whether these physicians became more geographically concentrated. Results Between 2015 and 2024, the number of CCFP(EM) and FRCPC physicians increased in overall numbers but their unique locations remained stable. Mapping of these locations suggests clustering into urban or suburban areas in the province. CCFP(EM) physicians have become more concentrated over time (Morans I of 0.234 and 0.308 in 2015 and 2024) relative to FRCPC physicians (Morans I of 0.096 and 0.103). Conclusion We find that, from 2015 to 2024, emergency physicians have become more concentrated in the province of Ontario due to CCFP(EM) physicians concentrating around urban areas with academic centres. Policies relying on less extensively trained providers to plug staffing gaps may not necessarily be effective in improving equitable access to physicians.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

We captured sex differences in limbic and non-limbic structures using machine learning models trained in cross-sectional brain imaging data of 1132 youths, yielding limbic and non-limbic estimates of brain sex. Applied to two independent longitudinal samples (total: 8184 youths), our models revealed pronounced sex differences in brain structure with increasing age. For females, brain sex was sensitive to pubertal development (menarche) over time and, for limbic structures, to mood-related mental health. Our findings highlight the limbic system as a key contributor to the development of sex differences in the brain and the potential of machine learning models for brain sex classification to investigate sex-specific processes relevant to mental health.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

Since most of the neural matrix is composed of sugars, development of genetically encoded tags has been limited. Therefore, although several staining protocols exist for ECM in fixed tissue, there are no reliable matrix labels for live imaging. Here we report a viral-mediated fluorescent probe that binds to HA and labels the mouse brain ECM. The vector encodes the HA binding domain from neurocan fused to GFP and an externalization tag (AAV-Ncan-GFP), enabling transduced cells to secrete the fluorescent hyalectan into the extracellular space, thereby labeling HA. We demonstrate stable probe expression in organotypic brain slices, as well as in vivo in the mouse cortex, where it labels both perineuronal nets and interstitial matrix. We validate HA labeling through colocalization with HABP and sensitivity to hyaluronidase, and confirm the probes extracellular localization by shadow imaging. As a proof of concept, we combine AAV-Ncan-GFP with dendritic spine imaging ex vivo and calcium transient imaging in vivo, providing a real-time map of local ECM alongside neural function. The probe enables time-lapse imaging of ECM dynamics in live mice, facilitating longitudinal studies across a wide range of timescales, from minutes to days. The results establish AAV-Ncan-GFP as a valuable tool for real-time observation of brain ECM and a promising resource to explore ECM dynamics and brain function in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1746223719180

The All of Us Research Program (All of Us) is one of the world's largest sequencing efforts that will generate genetic data for over one million individuals from diverse backgrounds. This historic megaproject will create novel research platforms that integrate an unprecedented amount of genetic data with longitudinal health information. Here, we describe the design of Celeste, a resilient, open-source cloud architecture for implementing genomics workflows that has successfully analyzed petabytes of participant genomic information for All of Us - thereby enabling other large-scale sequencing efforts with a comprehensive set of tools to power analysis. The Celeste infrastructure is tremendously scalable and has routinely processed fluctuating workloads of up to 9,000 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) samples for All of Us, monthly. It also lends itself to multiple projects. Serverless technology and container orchestration form the basis of Celeste's system for managing this volume of data. Results. In 12 months of production (within a single Amazon Web Services (AWS) Region), around 200 million serverless functions and over 20 million messages coordinated the analysis of 1.8 million bioinformatics, quality control, and clinical reporting jobs. Adapting WGS analysis to clinical projects requires adaptation of variant-calling methods to enrich the reliable detection of variants with known clinical importance. Thus, we also share the process by which we tuned the variant-calling pipeline in use by the multiple genome centers supporting All of Us to maximize precision and accuracy for low fraction variant calls with clinical significance. Conclusions. When combined with hardware-accelerated implementations for genomic analysis, Celeste had far-reaching, positive implications for turn-around time, dynamic scalability, security, and storage of analysis for one hundred-thousand whole-genome samples and counting. Other groups may align their sequencing workflows to this harmonized pipeline standard, included within the Celeste framework, to meet clinical requisites for population-scale sequencing efforts. Celeste is available as an Amazon Web Services (AWS) deployment in GitHub, and includes command-line parameters and software containers.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

We conveniently collected a pair of eye swab samples from twenty-five patients presenting symptoms of acute conjunctivitis at clinics in Dar es Salaam during the outbreak. One for bacterial culture and another for molecular detection. MacConkey and Blood agar were used to culture patient samples to identify possible bacterial causes. A Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR targeting Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Human Enterovirus and Parainfluenza. Positive samples with Ct value less than 30 for enterovirus were subjected to genomic sequencing by Illumina Miseq after library preparation and enrichment by Illumina's Respiratory Pathogen ID/AMR enrichment panel kit as per manufacturer's instructions (RPIP kit), followed by bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis.

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

Here, we present the largest study to date examining faculty anxiety, analyzing data from 2,106 professors across 62 U.S. higher education institutions using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) assessment. This comprehensive dataset revealed previously unknown patterns in how familial relationships and academic lineage influence faculty anxiety. Our analysis uncovered a clear relationship between academic rank and anxiety levels, with tenure-track assistant professors showing the highest anxiety scores (predicted GAD-7 = 7.9) compared to full professors. While academic discipline explains only 0.32% of anxiety variance, we identify institutional factors and family support as major moderators of faculty mental health. We find that close family relationships significantly moderated anxiety across institution types, with particularly strong protective effects at HBCUs/HSIs (b = -4.24, p = .015). Having an academic parent emerged as a novel protective factor, especially for faculty in STEM and Humanities (p < .018 and p < .010, respectively). These findings address a crucial gap in understanding faculty mental health and suggest that institutions should implement targeted interventions focusing on reinforcing social support systems, particularly for early-career academics.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180

This approach relies on the assumption that the pathogen spreads in a well-mixed population, where frequency changes are solely driven by selection. Yet, spatial structure can have major consequences on the spread of the new variant. Here, we model the change in frequency across time and across space of a new pathogen variant spreading in a two-patch host metapopulation. Crucially, we show that even small rates of migration can interfere with the effects of selection and may bias the estimation of fitness. We illustrate this effect with the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 by contrasting the spread of the Alpha and the Delta variants in England. We contend that the observed heterogeneity of fitness estimates across space could result from the variation of host mobility which is expected to affect pathogen migration.

While mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is well-established for its role in regulating type I and III IFN production, our research unveils a previously unidentified, yet more significant, overarching function: MAVS acts as a protector of mitochondria against mitophagy triggered by viruses and toxins. We show that MAVS is crucial for maintaining TOM complex functionality by influencing the levels of key outer and inner membranes translocases (TOM20/TOM70/TIM23), and the spatial distribution/organization between TOM20:TOM70 in mitochondria. Disruptions to these features caused by MAVS loss, likely compromise mitochondrial protein import, leading to increased mitochondrial PINK1 stabilization and its phosphorylation, and elevated mitophagy. These changes resulted in significantly compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics, with implications on immune response. Notably, MAVS supplementation not only mitigated mitophagy in MAVS KO cells, but also conferred protection against mitophagy induced by viruses (SARS-CoV-2, and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)), and mitotoxins, indicating its broad protective role against mitophagy. Furthermore, we reveal that MAVS-mediated mitochondrial stabilization elicits a robust antiviral immunity against mitophagy-inducing viruses without engaging IFN- and NF-{kappa}B pathways, underscoring the significance of this mechanism in host antiviral defense. The redefined role of MAVS as a critical mitochondrial stabilizer has implications extending beyond its broad antiviral immunity, which involves both IFN-dependent and IFN-independent mechanisms, to encompass various pathological conditions involving mitochondrial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1746223719180

SwIAVs circulating in pigs in England between 2014 and 2021 were characterised using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequencing data from 82 of 368 influenza A positive samples (71 submissions) were determined, identifying H1N1 and H1N2 subtypes from the 1A classical swine and 1B human-seasonal lineages respectively. The 1B lineage viruses were predominant, accounting for 68.29% of sequenced viruses, with 1A lineage viruses comprising 31.71%, primarily from the 1A.3.3.2 clade (2009 H1N1 pandemic origin). This study characterised previously undefined diversity within the 1B lineage which led to the designation of new HA clades 1B.1.1.1, 1B.1.1.2 and 1B.1.1.3. Complete genome data were obtained from 64/82 viruses thereby updating the definition of genetic diversity thresholds and leading to the identification of 24 unique genotypes. All these 64 viruses contained PB2, PB1, PA, NP, MP, and NS gene segments of 2009 H1N1 pandemic origin. These data highlight the increasing divergence of SwIAV within pig populations England and emphasise the requirement for continued genomic surveillance to improve animal health and monitor zoonotic risk.","NA","biorxiv",1746223719180

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746223719180
