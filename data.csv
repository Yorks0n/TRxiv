In previous studies, we found enhanced IgG reactivity to EBV EBNA4 and EBNA6 arginine-rich sequences in postinfectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS). Objective: This study aims to investigate IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) EBNA4 and EBNA6 sequences and homologous human sequences in PCS and ME/CFS. Methods: The IgG responses against poly-R EBNA4 and EBNA6 and corresponding homologous human 15-mer peptides and respective full-length proteins were analyzed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex dot-blot assay. Sera of 45 PCS patients diagnosed according to WHO criteria, with 26 patients fulfilling the Canadian Consensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls (HC) were investigated. Results: Autoantibodies to poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-{beta} signaling regulator TSPLY2, angiogenic regulator TSPYL5, as well as to full-length -adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more frequent in patients. Several autoantibodies were positively associated with key symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognition, and pain. Conclusion: Collectively, we identified autoantibodies with new antigen specificities with a potential role in PCS and ME/CFS. Clinical Implication: These finding should prompt further studies on the function of these autoantibodies, their exploitation for diagnostic use, and of drugs targeting autoantibodies.","NA","medrxiv",1735769276141

While ML algorithms are proficient in general-purpose tasks, their highly technical nature often hinders their compatibility with the observed biological principles and constraints in the brain, thereby limiting their suitability for neuroscience applications. In this work, we introduce NeuroTorch, a comprehensive ML pipeline specifically designed to assist neuroscientists in leveraging ML techniques using biologically inspired neural network models. NeuroTorch enables the training of recurrent neural networks equipped with either spiking or firing-rate dynamics, incorporating additional biological constraints such as Dale's law and synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance. The pipeline offers various learning methods, including backpropagation through time and eligibility trace forward propagation, aiming to allow neuroscientists to effectively employ ML approaches. To evaluate the performance of NeuroTorch, we conducted experiments on well-established public datasets for classification tasks, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Heidelberg. Notably, NeuroTorch achieved accuracies that replicated the results obtained using the Norse and SpyTorch packages. Additionally, we tested NeuroTorch on real neuronal activity data obtained through volumetric calcium imaging in larval zebrafish. On training sets representing 9.3 minutes of activity under darkflash stimuli from 522 neurons, the mean proportion of variance explained for the spiking and firing-rate neural network models, subject to Dale's law, exceeded 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Our analysis of networks trained on these datasets indicates that both Dale's law and spiking dynamics have a beneficial impact on the resilience of network models when subjected to connection ablations. NeuroTorch provides an accessible and well-performing tool for neuroscientists, granting them access to state-of-the-art ML models used in the field without requiring in-depth expertise in computer science.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

We revealed PopZs hierarchical assembly into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations. The helical domain drives filamentation and condensation, while the disordered domain inhibits them. Phase-dependent conformational changes prevent interfilament contacts in the dilute phase and expose client binding sites in the dense phase.

Identifying active ingredients requires access to detailed intervention descriptions, such as from trial protocols or manuals. We conducted a large-scale survey of the accessibility of trial protocols or manuals for evidence-based psychological interventions, tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for multiple mental disorders. Methods: We assembled a large cohort of RCTs, selecting these from six large network meta-analyses of psychological interventions for severe mental disorders (schizophrenia and other psychotic, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa). For each trial and active intervention arm, we used a multipronged approach (published protocol, trial registries, author contact, commercial availability) to identify protocols or manuals. We described, by trial and by active intervention arm, the proportion for which protocols or manuals were (1) accessible, i.e., retrievable by any method, and (2) publicly available. Findings: We included 260 RCTs, with 401 active intervention arms. Of these, 20 RCTs (8%, 95% confidence interval/CI 5% to 12%) were associated to protocols, published separately or as supplement. For the remaining 240 trials, we contacted 450 authors. Authors shared protocols for 43 trials (18%, 95% CI 13% to 23%), refused to share for 73 (30%, 95% CI 25% to 37%) and did not respond for 101 (42%, 95% CI 36% to 49%). Protocols or manuals were retrievable for 318 (79%, 95% CI 75% to 83%) and publicly available for 88 (22%, 95% CI 18% to 26%) active intervention arms, respectively. Conclusions: Access to detailed descriptions of psychological interventions, even using multiple methods, is difficult and burdensome, hampering much-needed examinations of treatment components. Relying only on open-access resources and sharing from authors, a researcher would be able to access about one third of trial protocols or manuals. Improving dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments requires publicly available treatment manuals.

We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titers of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes was determined. To examine monocyte response to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients and BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS. Results: Post COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive- alongside with lower frequency of BCG seropositive- patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19.

Dysfunctional mitochondria trigger problems in various neuronal tasks. Using the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, we previously reported that Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunits were required for maintaining NMJ function and growth. Here we report tissue-specific adaptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But instead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destructive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmission. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the Drosophila system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics (~<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma (~40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Researchers routinely estimate representational distances from brain-activity measurements that either sparsely sample the underlying neural population (e.g. neural recordings) or pool across the activity of many neurons (e.g. fMRI voxels). Here we use theory and simulations to clarify under what circumstances representational distances estimated from brain-activity measurements reflect the representational geometry of the underlying neural population, and what distortions must be expected under other circumstances. We demonstrate that the estimated representational distances are undistorted if single neurons are sampled at random. For voxels that take non-negatively weighted linear combinations, the resulting geometry is linearly distorted, correctly reflecting the population-mean dimension, while downscaling all orthogonal dimensions, for which the averaging cancels a large portion of the signal. Surprisingly, removing the mean from voxel patterns recovers the underlying representational geometry exactly in expectation under idealized conditions. This explains why the correlation distance, the most popular measure of representational dissimilarity in neuroimaging studies, ``works"" so well, yielding geometries that can appear similar between fMRI and neural recordings. The Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) distance computed after removing the mean of each pattern (without normalizing its variance) is an attractive alternative to the correlation distance in that it corrects for the inflated relative contribution of the population-mean dimension, while avoiding the drawback of the correlation distance: it can be large for confusable low-norm patterns, failing to reflect decodability. Our results demonstrate that measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry when (1) single neurons are sampled at random or (2) the weights with which the measured responses sample the neurons are drawn i.i.d. and (2a) the weights are drawn from a zero-mean distribution or (2b) the population mean is the same for all conditions or (2c) the mean is removed from each estimated pattern. We discuss practical implications for analyses of neural representational geometries.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

However, whether tempo is responsible for these differences in magnitude, and how, remains to be determined. Here, we used brain organoids to investigate this and observed that human axon tracts spend more time growing and extend farther compared to those of mice, independent of their tissue environment. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis pointed to a subset of calcium-permeable ion channels expressed throughout neuron development, including during axon tract outgrowth. Calcium imaging during early neuron development consistently revealed a reduced calcium influx in human neurons compared to mouse neurons. Stimulating calcium influx and increasing cAMP levels resulted in premature halting of axon tract outgrowth and shorter axon tracts, mimicking the mouse phenotype, while abrogating calcium influx led to an even longer phase of axon tract outgrowth and longer axon tracts in humans. Thus, evolutionary differences in calcium regulation set the tempo of neuronal development, by extending the time window to foster the more elaborated human neuron morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

However, there is no universally accepted or applied statistical test to analyze the performance of these circuits. Many basic statistical tests fail to capture the predicted logic (OR, AND, etc.) and most studies neglect statistical analysis entirely. As synthetic gene circuits shift toward advanced applications, primarily in computing, biosensing, and human health, it is critical to standardize the statistical methods used to evaluate gate success. Here, we propose the application of a linear mixed effects model to analyze and quantify genetic Boolean logic gate performance. First, we analyzed 144 currently published Boolean logic gates for trends and used unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) to validate the statistical model. Next, we utilized the model to generate estimates for the fixed effect of the ON state, {beta}, as a general descriptor of the Boolean nature of a circuit and used Monte Carlo simulations to recommend sample sizes for evaluating gate performance. Finally, we examined {beta} as a holistic metric for circuit performance using a series of nested repressor OR gates with intentionally degraded performance. We observed a linear correlation between {beta} and the predicted translation rate, highlighting the use of {beta} for the forward design of new Boolean gates. In summary, we utilized a linear mixed effects model to describe synthetic gene circuits and determined that the fixed effect, {beta}, is an appropriate descriptor of gate behavior that can be used to statistically evaluate performance.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Emerging work suggests that the thalamus, the relay center of the brain that undergoes secondary damage after cortical TBI, is involved with heightened seizure risks after TBI. TBI also induces the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, to the site(s) of injury, but it is unclear how these cells impact neurological sequelae post-TBI. Here, we characterize the identities and kinetics of lymphocytic infiltrates into the cortex and thalamus using a mouse model of cortical TBI. We identify a population of IFN{gamma}-producing type 1 lymphocytes that infiltrate specific thalamic subregions over weeks following injury, where they elicit a local IFN{gamma} response in microglia and neuronal subset(s). Depletion of CD4+ T cells protects mice from TBI-induced seizure susceptibility by de-repressing other non-CD4+ type 1 lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia (DAMs) in the thalamus.

Changes in astrocyte function contribute to depressive-like behaviors. However, while neuronal mechanisms driving MDD have been studied in some detail, molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes promote depression have not been extensively explored. To uncover astrocyte contributions to MDD, we subjected male mice to chronic social defeat stress precipitated by encounters with a dominant male. Animals exposed to this treatment exhibit symptoms indicative of MDD, including reduced social interactions, anxiety, despair, and anhedonia. We then measured astrocyte translating mRNA expression changes in mice that underwent chronic social defeat and control animals using ribosome affinity purification. Bioinformatic analyses reveal significant alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), consistent with previous studies implicating this brain region in MDD. Expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, cell-cell interaction proteins, and proteins controlling glutamatergic synaptic function are significantly altered. These changes correlate with perturbation of glutamatergic transmission, measured by electrophysiology, and increased synaptic cleft size. Among ECM genes, increased expression of mRNAs encoding the synaptic remodeling protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc) correlates the most with the depressive phenotype. Furthermore, presence of Sparc and other ECM proteins in synaptosomes is also increased and overexpressing Sparc in PFC partially alleviates stress symptoms. Our results raise the possibility that increased expression of Sparc may be a natural protective mechanism against stress-induced synaptic dysfunction in depression.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

In this vaccine, the Cys538 in the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is linked, through a thiosuccinimide linker, to lysine residues of tetanus toxoid (TT) preparation. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that TT is a complex mixture of proteins, similar to other TTs where the detoxified tetanus neurotoxin (d-TeNT) has been shown to be the most abundant protein (30-56%), regardless the quantification method used. The fifteen most abundant proteins account for approximately 78% of the total proteins. LC-MS/MS analysis of the activation process showed that 102 out of 107 lysine residues in the d-TeNT incorporated a maleimide group. In contrast, when tryptic peptides isolated by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, only 22 Lys residues in the d-TeNT were cross-linked to the RBD C-terminal tryptic peptide (538CVNF541-HHHHHH), probably due to steric hindrance. Twelve and eighteen conjugation sites were assigned based on the identification of linear peptides carrying a conjugated lysine residues (K(+1454.58 Da) or K(+1472.59 Da)) and cross-linked peptides with stabilized linker forms, respectively. Eight conjugation sites were coincidently assigned by both strategies. The assignment of the conjugation sites was manually validated by observed regularities (z equal or higher to 3+, XIC, immonium ions, specific linker fragment ions) not considered by the identification software (PEAKS, Kojak and pLink2).

However, the number of observable gene conversion tracts per study has so far been limited by the use of pedigree or sperm-typing data to detect gene conversion events.

Cannulae have been postulated to act as a primitive extracellular matrix through which cells could communicate or exchange material, although their native biological function remains obscure. Here, we report cryoEM structural analyses of ex vivo cannulae and of in vitro protein assemblies derived from recombinant cannula-like proteins. Three-dimensional reconstructions of P. abyssi cannulae revealed that the structural interactions between protomers in the native and recombinant filaments were based on donor strand complementation, a form of non-covalent polymerization in which a donor {beta}-strand from one subunit is inserted into an acceptor groove in a {beta}-sheet of a neighboring subunit. Donor strand complementation in cannulae is reinforced through calcium ion coordination at the interfaces between structural subunits in the respective assemblies. While donor strand complementation occurs during the assembly of chaperone-usher pili, this process requires the participation of accessory proteins that are localized in the outer membrane. In contrast, we demonstrate that calcium ions can induce assembly of cannulae in the absence of other co-factors. Crystallographic analysis of a recombinant cannula-like protein monomer provided evidence that calcium ion binding primes the precursor for donor strand invasion through unblocking of the acceptor groove. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that structurally homologous cannula-like proteins occurred within the genomes of other hyperthermophilic archaea and were encompassed within the TasA superfamily of biomatrix proteins. CryoEM structural analyses of tubular filaments derived from in vitro assembly of a recombinant cannula-like protein from an uncultured Hyperthermus species revealed a common mode of assembly to the Pyrodictium cannulae, in which donor strand complementation and calcium ion binding stabilized longitudinal and lateral assembly in tubular 2D sheets.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Metastatic spreading correlates with tumor cell state evolution. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative dosage of oncogenic KRAS drives lung adenocarcinoma progression and metastasis via the integration of external signaling and pioneer transcription factor dynamics into qualitative cell states. Combining mouse models, in vivo CRISPR activation screens, and fate mapping, we show that even mild transcriptional amplification of KRAS significantly fuels tumor progression and metastasis. Chromatin profiling and transcriptomics reveal that high and low KRAS dosages supersede and integrate inflammatory and TGF{beta} signaling to dictate mouse cancer cell states. Patient data show that KRAS dosages correlate with distinct survival outcomes, transcription factor activity, and cell states. Direct KRAS inhibition in xenografts limits the KRAS-high ""proliferative"" cell state but spares a minimal residual state mimicking the KRAS-low ""ciliated-like"" state. Thus, oncogenic KRAS dosage fuels tumor heterogeneity at the cell state level and drives a bimodal tumor evolution during metastasis, with implications for prognosis and treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches. Unicore is universally applicable to any given set of taxa, even spanning superkingdoms and overcoming limitations of previous methods requiring orthologs of fixed taxonomic scope, and is available as a free and open source software at https://github.com/steineggerlab/unicore.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

However, it is unclear how an accurate discrimination could be beneficial to a goal-guided behavior in a changing environment. Therefore, we used chemogenetic inhibition to study the role of the dentate gyrus in a goal-guided spatial navigation paradigm over a familiar but dynamic crossword maze. Mice were challenged to localize a novel reward location from alternative pathways in two versions of the task with particular configurations in each experimental day. In the simple task, the two optimal paths to the goal shared some segments in their trajectory. In a more complex task, optimal trajectories demanded completely different directions to the reward location. Overall, mice with chemogenetic inhibition of the dentate gyrus were able to learn all the routes regardless the complexity of the task, similarly to control animals. However, after having solved a first route in the complex task, mice with dentate gyrus inhibition displayed an impairment to efficiently navigate over the alternate path.

Raw assemblies of this same strain were reported circular and differed by 6.4 kb, raising questions about their accuracy. Therefore, our computational analysis, removing duplicate ends, aligning genomes to the origin of replication, and circularization, revealed a minimal size difference of only 32 bp, with MxDZ2_Tam being slightly larger. Further comparative analysis identified 40 sequence variations: 38 indels and 2 substitutions, with 24 variations concerning 18 coding genes. Eight of these 24 variations triggered frameshift mutations, seven of them encountered a premature stop codon followed by a second ORF and the remaining three had a premature stop codon followed by a non-coding region. 78% of these variations were detected in the regions which had repeated bases, especially guanine and cytosine, which is one of the well-known sequencing limitations. Although PacBio HiFi technology, used for the complete assemblies, boasts a low error rate, it remains higher than the 454-platform used for the earlier MxDZ2_Kirby assembly.

In response, injury-born stem cell progeny differentiate faster compared to healthy-born counterparts, yet the mechanisms that pace differentiation are unclear. Using the adult Drosophila intestine, we find that injury speeds cell differentiation by altering the lateral inhibition circuit that transduces a fate-determining Notch signal. During healthy intestinal turnover, a balanced ratio of terminal (Notch-active) and stem (Notch-inactive) fates arises through canonical lateral inhibition feedback, in which mutual Notch-Delta signaling between two stem cell daughters evolves to activate Notch and extinguish Delta in exactly one cell. When we damage intestines by feeding flies toxin, mutual signaling persists, but a cytokine relay from damaged cells to differentiating daughters prevents the Notch co-repressor Groucho from extinguishing Delta. Despite Delta persistence, injured organs preserve the Notch-inactive stem cell pool; thus, fate balance does not hinge on an intact circuit. Mathematical modeling predicts that increased Delta prompts faster Notch signaling; indeed, in vivo live imaging reveals that the real-time speed of Notch signal transduction doubles in injured guts. These results show that in tissue homeostasis, lateral inhibition feedback between stem cell daughters throttles the speed of Notch-mediated fate determination by constraining Delta. Tissue-level damage signals relax this constraint to accelerate cell differentiation for expedited organ repair.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Using high-resolution time-lapse imaging and specific molecular perturbations, we found that EGF signaling via PI3K stabilizes and maintains a polarized leader bleb. Protein activity biosensors revealed a unique EGFR and PI3K activity gradient decreasing from rear-to-front, promoting PIP3 and Rac1-GTP accumulation at the bleb rear, with its antagonists PIP2 and RhoA-GTP concentrated at the bleb tip, opposite to the front-to-rear organization of these signaling modules in integrin-mediated mesenchymal migration. Optogenetic experiments showed that disrupting this gradient caused bleb retraction, underscoring the role of this signaling gradient in bleb stability. Mathematical modeling and experiments identified a mechanism where, as the bleb initiates, CD44 and ERM proteins restrict EGFR mobility in a membrane-apposed cortical actin meshwork in the bleb rear, establishing a rear-to-front EGFR-PI3K-Rac activity gradient. Thus, our study reveals the biophysical and molecular underpinnings of cell polarity in bleb-based migration of metastatic cells in non-adhesive confinement, and underscores how alternative spatial arrangements of migration signaling modules can mediate different migration modes according to the local microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Phase transition has been extensively analysed in herbaceous species such as Arabidopsis and maize, where the sequential activity of miR156 and miR172 in the control of the juvenile to adult phase transition has been determined. Contrarily, little is known about most woody perennial crops, where phase transition appears to be dissociated, with a first transition from juvenile to adult vegetative state in the first year and a subsequent induction to flower in later years under flowering-inductive environmental conditions. This significantly extended vegetative phase makes fruit production depend on the grafting of adult vegetative materials. The curiosity of grapevines is that vegetative phase transition is marked by the differentiation of the first tendril, a reproductive organ used for climbing, and that causes it to be constantly generated, although in a sterile form. When the grapevine plant reaches flowering inductive condition in later years, it produces inflorescences in place of some tendrils. As a first step to understand the regulation of phase change in grapevine, we have performed a detailed gene expression analysis of the juvenile-to-adult phase transition during the development of grapevine plantlets grown from seeds. The RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that miR156 was significantly repressed in the grapevine's adult phase, where the appearance of tendrils acts as a marker of the transition. Consistent with the results reported in other species, we observed the activation of several SPL genes, known to be targets of miR156, providing evidence for the conservation of the regulatory module miR156-SPLs in grapevine. However, no variation was detected in the expression of miR172 and TPS genes were found downregulated, two key determinants in the transition to flowering in other species. This could be explained considering that grapevines do not flower during the first years of growth. Interestingly, we were still able to observe the overexpression of several genes known to be involved in the establishment of flower meristem identity, which in the case of grape had also been detected along tendril development, consistent with the proposed common ontogenetic origin of tendrils and inflorescences in the Vitaceae family.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Previous studies have identified an interbacterial toxin predicted to exhibit proteolytic activity that is broadly distributed among Gram-negative bacteria. However, the precise mechanism of intoxication remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that one such protease toxin from Escherichia coli, Cpe1, disrupts DNA replication and segregation by recognizing and cleaving conserved sequences in the essential type II DNA topoisomerases GyrB and ParE. Cpe1 belongs to the papain-like cysteine protease family and is associated with toxin delivery pathways, including the type VI secretion system and contact-dependent growth inhibition. The crystal structure of Cpe1 in complex with its immunity protein reveals a neutralization mechanism involving competitive substrate binding rather than active site occlusion, distinguishing it from previously characterized effector-immunity pairs. Collectively, our findings unveil a unique mode of interbacterial intoxication and provide insights into how bacteria protect themselves from self-poisoning by protease toxins.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Understanding how SARS CoV-2 alters the host metabolism may lead to treatments for COVID-19. We report that a ubiquitous gaseous molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), regulates redox, metabolism, and mitochondrial bioenergetics to control SARS-CoV-2. Virus replication is associated with down-regulation of the H2S producing enzymes cystathionine-{beta}-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-{gamma}-lyase (CTH), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), resulting in diminished endogenous H2S levels. Inhibition of CTH resulted in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. A slow-releasing H2S donor, GYY4137, diminished virus replication by inducing Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, restoring redox balance and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals with GYY4137 suppressed viral replication, ameliorated respiratory pathology, and restored antioxidant gene expression. Notably, whole-body plethysmography showed improved pulmonary function variables, including pulmonary obstruction and end-expiratory pause upon GYY4137 treatment in vivo. Data extend our understanding of H2S-mediated regulation of viral-infections, and open new avenues for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities for coronavirus-associated disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Muscle cell reorganization occurs in response to various physiological stimuli; however, the mechanisms behind this remodeling remain enigmatic due to the lack of a genetically trackable system. Previously, we reported that a subset of larval muscle cells is remodeled into adult abdominal muscle through an autophagy-dependent mechanism in Drosophila. To unveil the underlying mechanisms of this remodeling, we performed a comparative time-course RNA-seq analysis of isolated muscle cells with or without autophagy. It revealed both transcriptional dynamics independent of autophagy and highlighted the significance of BNIP3-mediated mitophagy in muscle remodeling. Mechanistically, we found that BNIP3 recruits autophagic machinery to mitochondria through its LC3-interacting (LIR) motif and minimal essential region (MER), which interact with Atg8a and Atg18a, respectively. Loss of BNIP3 leads to a substantial accumulation of larval mitochondria, ultimately impairing muscle remodeling. In summary, this study demonstrates that BNIP3-dependent mitophagy is critical for orchestrating the dynamic process of muscle remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Methods: In this study, Leishmania overexpressor Ld_{zeta}1domain (OE) were transformed by electroporation using a GFP-tagged Ld_{zeta}1domain recombinant plasmid. The resulting overexpressing cells were analysed in vitro to assess their growth dynamics and infectivity. We also investigated the immune-protective potential of these overexpressor in a mouse model challenged with Leishmania donovani. The immune response, including Th1 and Th2 pathways, was thoroughly characterized using RT-PCR and ELISA assays. In addition, the study conducted a thorough evaluation of the mouse's spleen and liver parasites, as well as quantitative evaluation of tissue pathological changes. Results: Ld_{zeta}1 domain (OE) parasites exhibited significantly lower viability and replication rates than WT parasites, and in vivo studies showed that mice immunized with the Ld_{zeta}1(OE) domain had lower parasite numbers than mice infected with LdWT. Spleen and liver showed significant histological changes suggestive of protection. Parasite burden in the spleen and liver of vaccinated mice were significantly reduced. The immune response showed increased IFN-{gamma} levels and lower IL-10 production, resulting in a greater IFN-{gamma}/IL-10 ratio, indicating parasite elimination. The vaccination also caused a significant IgG humoral response and increased nitric oxide production in immunized mice. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated that overexpressing the zeta toxin resulted in controlled parasite attenuation, lowering pathogenicity while retaining immunogenic features. Our work established the zeta over-expressor's protective efficacy, immunogenicity, and proliferation in response to a Leishmania challenge in vitro and in vivo. This preliminary prototype study suggested that Ld_{zeta}1domain (OE) parasites may be suitable for developing an attenuated vaccine against leishmaniasis.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1735769276142

However, little is known about how the brain may reconcile the ability to produce hardwired responses essential to survival while still allowing for adaptive flexibility. Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses, an innate predator-evasion behaviour, can be robustly extinguished via repeated unreinforced presentation over several days. We report that this extinction is long-lasting and generalises to other contexts, but can be rapidly recovered via the pairing of the visual stimulus with an aversive electric foot-shock stimulus. Moreover, fiber photometric recordings reveal that this behavioural paradigm results in the attenuation of SC and PAG physiological responses to visual looming stimuli, and that these responses do not recover following recovery of behavioural responses. An analysis of c-Fos expression patterns throughout the midbrain and hippocampus uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned visual looming fear responses. We investigate the functional significance of this vCA1 ensemble and report that, while its activity is not necessary for innate defensive behaviour, it is necessary for learned fear responses. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in enabling adaptive behavioural responses to the innately threatening visual looming stimulus which acts in complement with innate circuitry of the SC and PAG.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Furthermore, gene editing, reporter lines and protein overexpression implicate the stomatal transcription factor MUTE in facilitating additional rounds of asymmetric divisions that form SCs in succulents.

While this period of beta cell dysfunction is well established, its cause and underlying mechanism remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, live human pancreas tissue slices were prepared from autoantibody- negative organ donors without diabetes (ND), donors positive for one or more islet autoantibodies (AAb+), and donors with T1D within 0-4 years of diagnosis (T1D+). Dynamic imaging and physiological secretion studies were conducted to assess the extent and impact of T cell infiltration on beta cell function through immunolabeling, Ca2+ imaging, and perifusion assays for insulin secretion. Beta cells were identified in living slices by ENTPD3 cell surface staining. Beta cells from both ND and AAb+ donors exhibited normal cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization in response to high glucose and KCl. Beta cells from donors with T1D had significantly diminished Ca2+ responses to high glucose but preserved responses to KCl. In T1D, glucose responsiveness was impaired in both T cell-infiltrated and non-infiltrated insulin positive islets, supporting the concept that beta cell dysfunction is independent of close spatial association between beta cells and T cells. Fixed tissue staining and gene expression profiling of laser-capture microdissected islets revealed significant decreases in markers of glucose metabolism to ATP in beta cells from donors with T1D but no changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. From these data, we posit that functional defects occur in beta cells during T1D pathogenesis independent of local T cell infiltration and beta cell destruction. Additionally, these beta cell metabolic defects contribute to the clinical manifestation of dysglycemia at T1D diagnosis despite a remaining mass of beta cells.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Targeting of multiple surface antigens may ensure complete immunological coverage of leukemic blast populations, but such antigens are often also present on healthy haematopoietic populations. To address likely aplasia, strategies can be designed to bridge CAR T cell therapies to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), as demonstrated in recent anti-CD7 CAR T cell studies. Here we report that monotherapy using base edited (BE)  universal donor CAR T cells against CD33, CLL-1, or CD7 delivered inhibition of AML in immunodeficient mice when antigen expression was homogenous, but combined use of BE-CAR33 and BE-CARCLL-1 T cells was required to address heterogenous CLL-1-/+CD33-/+ disease. We also demonstrate that removal of shared CD7 antigens enabled compatibility of BE-CAR33 with BE-CAR7 T cells, including in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of AML.

Here, we study a model of duplication-selection interaction, which is related to Haigh's mutation-selection model of Muller's ratchet. New gene copies are generated by duplication but fitness of individuals decreases as copy number increases. Our model comes in two flavours: duplicates are copied either from a single template or from any existing copy. A duplication-selection equilibrium exists in both cases for infinite size populations and is given by a shifted Poisson or a negative binomial distribution. Unless counteracted by synergistic epistasis, finite populations suffer from loss of low copy-number haplotypes by drift, forcing them into a regime called 'run-away evolution' in which new copies accumulate without bound nor equilibrium. We discuss a few empirical examples and interpret them in the light of our models. Generally, large gene families appear too overdispersed to fit the single template model suggesting a dynamic, and potentially accelerating, duplication process.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

When recognized by host immune receptors, these proteins become avirulence (AVR) effectors. Several sequence-diverse AVRPM3 effectors and the suppressor of AVRPM3-PM3 recognition (SVRPM3a1/f1) are involved in triggering allele-specific, Pm3-mediated resistance, but the molecular mechanisms controlling their function in the host cell remain unknown. Here, we describe that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other, suggesting they are present as dimers in the host cell. Alphafold2 modelling substantiated previous predictions that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 all adopt a core RNase-like fold. We found that a single amino acid mutation in a predicted surface exposed region of AVRPM3a2/f2 resulted in recognition by the PM3b immune receptor, which does not recognize wildtype AVRPM3a2/f2. This indicates that differential AVRPM3 recognition by variants of the highly related PM3 immune receptors is due to subtle differences in similar protein surfaces of sequence-diverse AVRs. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which homodimers of AVRPM3s are recognized by their corresponding PM3 variants and that heterodimer formation with SVRPM3a1/f1 allows for evasion of recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Nevertheless, condensates have been shown to interact with lipid membranes in diverse biological processes, such as autophagy and T-cell activation. Since many condensates are known to have a net surface charge density and associated electric potential(s), we hypothesized that they can induce a local membrane potential. Using an electrochromic dye, we demonstrate that poly-lysine/ATP condensates induce a localized membrane potential in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles. This effect diminishes with increasing salt concentration and higher ATP-to-poly-lysine ratios, underscoring the key role of condensate charge. Numerical modeling of the condensate-membrane interface using an electro-thermodynamic framework supports our experimental findings and highlights parameters expected to play a key role in the effect. These results have broad implications for biological processes regulated by membrane potential, particularly in contexts such as neuronal signaling, where condensate interactions with membranes may play a previously unrecognized regulatory role.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here we propose a novel analytical approach: a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intra-cortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain; the latter can explain observed differences in the feature-tuning of perturbation responses in the presence vs. absence of visual stimuli.

Significance StatementThe cerebral cortex is strongly re-currently connected with complex wiring rules. This circuitry can now be probed by studying responses to optogenetic perturbations of one or small numbers of cells. However, we currently lack a general theory connecting these responses to underlying circuitry. Here we develop a novel, exactly solvable theory to determine responses to small perturbations from the underlying connectivity. Analysis of these equations reveals simple rules that govern perturbation response patterns. Comparison with experimental data yields new constraints on the connectivity parameters. The theory yields predictions for the responses of unmeasured cell types and in new experimental conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Here we consider a ""standard admixture"" model that assumes the admixed populations are unrelated and also a generalized model, where the admixed populations themselves are related via coancestry (or covariance) of allele frequencies. The generalized model yields a potentially more realistic and substantially more flexible model that we call ""super admixture"". This super admixture model provides a one-to-one mapping in terms of probability moments with the population-level kinship model, the latter of which is a general model of genome-wide relatedness and structure based on identity-by-descent. We introduce a method to estimate the super admixture model that is based on method of moments, does not rely on likelihoods, is computationally efficient, and scales to massive sample sizes. We apply the method to several human data sets and show that the admixed populations are indeed substantially related, implying the proposed method captures a new and important component of evolutionary history and structure in the admixture model. We show that the fitted super admixture model estimates relatedness between all pairs of individuals at a resolution similar to the kinship model. The super admixture model therefore provides a tractable, forward generating probabilistic model of complex structure and relatedness that should be useful in a variety of scenarios.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

However, the composition and function of protist-associated microbiomes remains largely elusive. Here, we employ cultivation-independent single-cell isolation and genome-resolved metagenomics to provide detailed insights into underexplored microbiomes and viromes of over 100 currently uncultivable ciliates and amoebae isolated from diverse environments. Our findings reveal unique microbiome compositions and hint at an intricate network of complex interactions and associations with bacterial symbionts and viruses. We observed stark differences between ciliates and amoebae in terms of microbiome and virome compositions, highlighting the specificity of protist-microbe interactions. Over 115 of the recovered microbial genomes were affiliated with known endosymbionts of eukaryotes, including diverse members of the Holosporales, Rickettsiales, Legionellales, Chlamydiae, Dependentiae , and more than 250 were affiliated with possible host-associated bacteria of the phylum Patescibacteria. We also identified more than 80 giant viruses belonging to diverse viral lineages, of which some were actively expressing genes in single cell transcriptomes, suggesting a possible association with the sampled protists. We also revealed a wide range of other viruses that were predicted to infect eukaryotes or host-associated bacteria. Our results provide further evidence that protists serve as mediators of complex microbial and viral associations, playing a critical role in ecological networks. The frequent co-occurrence of giant viruses and diverse microbial symbionts in our samples suggests multipartite associations, particularly among amoebae. Our study provides a preliminary assessment of the microbial diversity associated with lesser-known protist lineages and paves the way for a deeper understanding of protist ecology and their roles in environmental and human health.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Apart from extensive evolution in the Spike protein, non-Spike mutations are accumulating across the entire viral genome and their functional impact is not well understood. To address the contribution of these mutations, we reconstructed genomes of recent Omicron variants with disabled Spike expression (replicons) to systematically compare their RNA replication capabilities independently from Spike. We also used a single reference replicon and complemented it with various Omicron variant Spike proteins to quantify viral entry capabilities in single-round infection assays. Viral entry and RNA replication were negatively correlated, suggesting that as variants evolve reduced entry functions under growing immune pressure on Spike, RNA replication increases as a compensatory mechanism. We identified multiple mutations across the viral genome that enhanced viral RNA replication. NSP6 emerged as a hotspot with a distinct L260F mutation independently arising in the BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.16 variants. Using mutant and revertant NSP6 viral clones, the L260F mutation was validated to enhance viral replication in cells and increase pathogenesis in mice. Notably, this mutation enhanced host lipid droplet consumption by NSP6 without impacting its known ER-zippering function or double-membrane vesicle morphology. Collectively, a systematic analysis of RNA replication of recent Omicron variants defined NSP6 key role in viral RNA replication that provides insight into evolutionary trajectories of recent variants with possible therapeutic implications.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735769276142

CAZyme3D contains a total of 870,740 AlphaFold predicted 3D structures (named Whole dataset). A subset of CAZymes 3D structures from 188,574 nonredundant sequences (named ID50 dataset) were subject to structural similarity-based clustering analyses. Such clustering allowed us to organize all CAZyme structures using a hierarchical classification, which includes existing levels defined by the CAZy database (class, clan, family, subfamily) and newly defined levels (subclasses, structural cluster [SC] groups, and SCs). The inter-family structural clustering successfully grouped CAZy families and clans with the same structural folds in the same subclasses. The intra-family structural clustering classified structurally similar CAZymes into SCs, which were further classified into SC groups. SCs and SC groups differed from sequence similarity-based CAZy subfamilies. With CAZyme structures as the search database, we created job submission pages, where users can submit query protein sequences or PDB structures for a structural similarity search.

We therefore present the current study, a repeated-measures dose-dependent study of the subjective and neural dynamics induced through DMT under naturalistic conditions. Nineteen participants received either a 20mg or 40mg dose of freebase DMT across two dosing sessions in a blinded, counterbalanced order, with blinding rates consistent across doses. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was collected, as well as time-resolved retrospective measures of subjective experience (Temporal Experience Tracing). Both doses of DMT induced rapid changes in experience dimensions. However, the 40mg dose induced significantly more extreme visual hallucinations and emotionally intense experiences. Further, we computed a variety of neural markers on the EEG data, and found that oscillatory alpha power and permutation entropy were most strongly associated with continuous subjective experience dimensions. Strikingly, lempel-ziv complexity, a previously hailed as a robust correlate of subjective experiences within the psychedelic-state, was the least strongly associated neural marker.

We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole.

Here, we present the development of PinkyCaMP, the first mScarlet-based Ca2+ sensor that outperforms current red fluorescent sensors in brightness, photostability, signal-to-noise ratio, and compatibility with optogenetics and neurotransmitter imaging. PinkyCaMP is well-tolerated by neurons, showing no toxicity or aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo. All imaging approaches, including single-photon excitation methods such as fiber photometry, widefield imaging, miniscope imaging, as well as two-photon imaging in awake mice, are fully compatible with PinkyCaMP.","NA","biorxiv",1735769276142

Here, we introduce Genomic Network Analysis (GNA), an analytic framework that applies the principles of network modelling to estimates of genetic overlap derived from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait. Extensive simulations establish GNA is well-powered for most GWAS. Application to a diverse set of traits demonstrate that GNA yields critical insight into the genetic architecture that demarcate genetically overlapping traits at varying levels of biological granularity.","NA","medrxiv",1735769276142
