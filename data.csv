ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698521

SNAP-tag2 presents a second-order rate constant with rhodamine substrates that approaches 107 s-1 M-1, a 100-fold improvement over the corresponding SNAP-tag-substrate pairs. When labeled with highly fluorogenic dyes, SNAP-tag2 also shows a 5-fold increase in fluorescence brightness relative to currently used SNAP-tag. The increased labeling kinetics and brightness of SNAP-tag2 translates into a greatly improved performance in various live-cell (super-resolution) imaging applications.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

This greatly enhances the usability of tools like OrthoFinder by making the detailed results much more visually accessible. This interface can scale reasonably up to hundreds of genomes, allows a user to filter this large dataset to a subset of samples they are interested in at that particular moment in time, or ""zoom in"" to only a subtree of the orthogroup.

The importance of this positioning is poorly understood. By relocating promoter-reporter constructs into >1,000 alternative positions within a single locus, we dissected the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. This revealed an intricate, sharply confined activation landscape, in which the native Sox2 gene occupies an optimal position for its activation. Deletion of the gene relaxes this confinement and broadly increases reporter activity. Surprisingly, the confining effect of the Sox2 gene is partially conferred by its [~]1 kb coding region. Our local relocation approach provides high-resolution functional maps of a genomic locus and reveals that a gene can strongly constrain the realm of influence of its enhancer.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, little is currently known about the role for O-glycosylation, another major class of carbohydrate polymer modifications. Here, we use parallel genetic, enzymatic, and mass spectrometry approaches to demonstrate that O-linked glycan biosynthesis is responsible for the majority of sialoglycoRNA levels. By examining the O-glycans associated with RNA from cell lines and colon organoids we find known and previously unreported O-linked glycan structures. Further, we find that O-linked glycans released from small RNA from organoids derived from ulcerative colitis patients exhibit higher levels of sialylation than glycans from healthy organoids. Together, our work provides flexible tools to interrogate O-linked glycoRNAs (O-glycoRNA) and suggests that they may be modulated in human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Here, we investigated the contribution of rare coding variants to DDs by analyzing 13,452 individuals with DDs, 18,613 of their family members, and 3,943 controls using a combination of family-based and case/control analyses. In line with previous studies of other neuropsychiatric traits, we found a significant burden of rare (allele frequency < 1x10-5) predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) and damaging missense variants, the vast majority of which are inherited from apparently unaffected parents. These predominantly inherited burdens are strongest in DD-associated genes or those intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population, however we estimate that ~10% of the excess of these variants in DD cases is found within the DD-associated genes, implying many more risk loci are yet to be identified. We found similar, but attenuated, burdens when comparing the unaffected parents of individuals with DDs to controls, indicating that parents have elevated risk of DDs due to these rare variants, which are overtransmitted to their affected children. We estimate that 6-8.5% of the population attributable risk for DDs are due to rare pLoF variants in those genes intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population. Finally, we apply a Bayesian framework to combine evidence from these analyses of rare, mostly-inherited variants with prior de novo mutation burden analyses to highlight an additional 25 candidate DD-associated genes for further follow up.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698521

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Addressing this gap, we generated extensive RNA-sequencing data for multiple organs across 22 representative species over the fern phylogeny, assembling high-quality transcriptomes. These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have navigated since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, this level of detail is typically difficult to attain in macromolecular crystallography because the diffracted intensities rapidly fade with increasing resolution. The problem cannot be circumvented by increasing the fluence as this leads to detrimental radiation damage. Previously, we demonstrated that high quality MicroED data can be obtained at low flux conditions using electron counting with direct electron detectors. The improved sensitivity and accuracy of these detectors essentially eliminate the read-out noise, such that the measurement of faint high-resolution reflections is limited by other sources of noise. Inelastic scattering is a major contributor of such noise, increasing background counts and broadening diffraction spots. Here, we demonstrate that a substantial improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved using an energy filter to largely remove the inelastically scattered electrons. This strategy resulted in sub-atomic resolution MicroED data from proteinase K crystals, enabling accurate structure modelling and the visualization of detailed features. Interestingly, filtering out the noise revealed diffuse scattering phenomena that can hold additional structural information. Our findings suggest that combining energy filtering and electron counting can provide more accurate measurements at higher resolution, providing better insights into protein function and facilitating more precise model refinement.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

This study aims to determine cost-saving risk thresholds for statin use in Germany to inform better prescription practices and healthcare policies.

MethodsA decision-analytic approach was employed, using secondary data to compare statin use with no statin use from the perspective of German sickness fund insurees. The analysis focused on cost savings from avoided cardiovascular (CV) events, translating these avoided events into net savings after accounting for treatment costs and potential side effects. The study considered the German adult population insured by sickness funds and used a lifetime horizon for the analysis.

ResultsThe maximum number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve cost savings over 10 years was found to be 40, leading to a minimum risk threshold for savings of 9.8%. It was estimated that approximately 22% of the adult population in Germany has a 10-year CV risk of [&ge;]9.8%, potentially avoiding between 307,049 and 705,537 CV events over 10 years, with net population savings of approximately {euro}18 billion.

ConclusionsThe current official threshold for statin prescription in Germany, set at a 20% 10-year risk, is too stringent. Lowering the threshold to 9.8% could significantly increase the number of patients benefiting from statin therapy, reducing CV events and generating substantial cost savings. These findings suggest that adjustments to prescription guidelines could improve cardiovascular outcomes and economic efficiency within the German healthcare system.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698521

Here, we uncover dynamic expression of Hes1, a direct NOTCH target3, in intestinal stem and progenitor cells, and investigate its role in vivo and in vitro. A knock-in reporter4 reveals distinct, cell-specific period lengths in Hes1 oscillations that form a gradient along the crypt-villus axis. Whereas secretory precursors oscillate at low periods, absorptive precursors oscillate at higher periods before transitioning to a differentiated state. To test the function of different oscillation periods, we innovated a microfluidic system that modulates Hes1 oscillations in organoids. We find that varying the oscillation period modulates secretory cell differentiation: While 90-min oscillations promote Paneth cells, 130-min oscillations increase formation of other secretory subtypes. Moreover, low-period oscillations support stemness and a proliferative state. Our study provides the first clear evidence that information for tissue homeostasis in the intestine is encoded in the temporal dynamics of signalling components.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Mitochondrial impairment or dysfunction is associated with lack of physical activity and considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCDs) aflicting our societies such as T2D, CVD, metabolic syndrome, and even AD.

To our knowledge, there is a scarcity of studies on the metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular characteristics of ""healthy sedentary"" individuals living without clinical symptoms. Hence, the main aim of our study herein was to characterize multiple metabolic, mitochondrial and cellular bioenergetic signatures in ""healthy sedentary"" individuals which could already be downregulated compared to moderately active individuals.

Nineteen subjects, 9 sedentary (SED) and 10 moderately active (AC) volunteered for multiple assessments including muscle biopsies, in order to assess muscle metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics both at rest and during exercise.

For our exercise studies, we performed graded exercise testing (GXT) to assess carbohydrate and fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity according to our previously developed methodology.

Resting studies showed decreased mitochondrial respiration including decreases in complex I (-36%) and II (-28%) as well as total electron system capacity (-34%) and electron system capacity coupled to ATP production via ATP synthase (-30%). Regarding muscle carbohydrate metabolism, SED individuals showed a decrease in mitochondrial pyruvate oxidation (-37%) as well as reduced expression (-49%) of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Regarding fatty acid metabolism, SED showed decreased activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1)(-51%) and CPT2 (-44%) as well as decreased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (-35%). Metabolomics analysis also confirmed downregulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) identified distinct metabolic phenotypes through intermediates of glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Further, we found significant differences in cardiolipin (CL) species expression between SED and AC groups, which, due to the important role of CL in mitochondrial structure, function, biogenesis and bioenergetics, deserves further attention.

Exercise studies also showed significant differences in substrate utilization between groups where SED possessed a significantly lower fat oxidation capacity as well as lactate clearance capacity. The correlation of different bioenergetic parameters between resting and exercise conditions were robust, suggesting the possibility of performing cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) as a non-invasive methodology to indirectly assess metabolic function in multiple populations. In summary, in our study herein, we show that ""healthy sedentary"" individuals already possess a significant decrease in cellular metabolism, mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics compared to moderately active individuals both during resting and exercising conditions.

- Despite similar GLUT-4 concentrations, sedentary individuals show significant decreased pyruvate oxidation as well as expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC).
- During exercise studies, sedentary individuals show significantly decreased levels of fat oxidation and lactate clearance capacity which correlate with mitochondrial and bioenergetics parameters from resting muscle biopsies. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) accompanied by measuring blood lactate levels could be a practical manner to assess muscle mitochondrial function and bioenergetics in a non-invasive and ambulatory manner.
- Identifying early signatures of decreased mitochondrial function and bioenergetics capacity could be an important approach to prevent or improve different metabolic diseases through lifestyle changes mainly from exercise and nutrition.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

We asked whether BTSP could also be a plasticity mechanism for generation of non-spatial responses in the hippocampus and what roles the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) play in driving non-spatial BTSP. By performing simultaneous calcium imaging of dorsal CA1 neurons and chemogenetic inhibition of LEC or MEC while mice performed an olfactory working memory task, we discovered BTSP-like events which formed stable odor-specific fields. Critically, the success rate of calcium events generating a significant odor-field increased with event amplitude, and large events exhibited asymmetrical formation with the newly formed odor-fields preceding the timepoint of their induction event. We found that MEC and LEC play distinct roles in modulating BTSP: MEC inhibition reduced the frequency of large calcium events, while LEC inhibition reduced the success rate of odor-field generation. Using two-photon calcium imaging of LEC and MEC temporammonic axons projecting to CA1, we found that LEC projections to CA1 were strongly odor selective even early in task learning, while MEC projection odor-selectivity increased with task learning but remained weaker than LEC. Finally, we found that LEC and MEC inhibition both slowed representational drift of odor representations in CA1 across 48 hours. Altogether, odor-specific information from LEC and strong odor-timed activity from MEC are crucial for driving BTSP in CA1, which is a synaptic plasticity mechanism for generation of both spatial and non-spatial responses in the hippocampus that may play a role in explaining representational drift and one-shot learning of non-spatial information.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Genes encoding many of these weapons can be transmitted horizontally, but the impact on bacterial warfare is not understood. Here, we develop an ecological model of bacterial warfare where there is potential for horizontal gene transfer. Our model predicts that weapon gene transfer from an attacker to a target strain is possible, but at a low rate such that transfer has a negligible impact on competition outcomes. We tested the model empirically using a transmissible plasmid encoding colicin E2, a potent antibacterial toxin produced by Escherichia coli. As predicted by the model, we find that toxin plasmid transfer is feasible during warfare, but the resulting transconjugants remain rare. However, exploring the model further reveals realistic conditions where transfer has major impacts. Specifically, the model predicts that whenever competing strains have access to some unique nutrients, transconjugants can proliferate and reach high abundances. In support of these predictions, short- and long-term experiments show that transconjugants can thrive when nutrient competition is relaxed. Our work shows how horizontal gene transfer can reshape bacterial warfare in a way that can benefit a weapon gene but not the bacteria that carries it.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Here, we develop an assay to measure hydropatterning in maize and reveal substantial differences between tropical/subtropical and temperate maize breeding germplasm that likely resulted from divergent selection.

Validated on various benchmarks, edgeHOG was applied to the entire OMA orthology database, encompassing 2,845 extant genomes across all domains of life. This represents the first tree-of-life scale inference, resulting in 1,133 ancestral genomes. In particular, we reconstructed ancestral contigs for the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, dating back around 1.8 billion years, and observed significant functional association among neighboring genes.

Here we characterise LISRR, a cancer-specific lncRNA highly expressed in melanoma patients refractory to ICB. In cells undergoing (therapeutic) stress, LISRR recruits DAZAP1 (Deleted in AZoospermia Associated Protein 1) to polysomes and drives the assembly of a subset of ribosomes at the endoplasmic reticulum, directing the synthesis of an immunosuppressive translatome. This includes the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and the enzymes necessary for building the glycocalyx, the sugar coat surrounding the cells. Notably, proper glycocalyx assembly is required for spermatozoa immune evasion during fertilization. Accordingly, targeting LISRR activates immune responses and re-sensitizes to ICB in co-culture models, ex vivo in patient explants, and in vivo in humanized patient-derived models.

Existing theoretical models have suggested the maintenance of a four-chromosome equilibrium (with driving and standard X and suppressing and susceptible Y) in a cyclic dynamic, studies of natural populations have failed to capture this pattern. Although there are several plausible explanations for this lack of cycling, interference from autosomal suppressors has not been studied using a theoretical population genetic framework even though autosomal suppressors and Y-linked suppressors coexist in natural populations of some species. In this study, we use a simulation-based approach to investigate the influence of autosomal suppressors on the cycling of sex chromosomes. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of an autosomal suppressor can hinder the invasion of a Y-linked suppressor under some parameter space, thereby impeding the cyclic dynamics, or even the invasion of Y-linked suppression. Even when a Y-linked suppressor invades, the presence of an autosomal suppressor can prevent cycling. Our study demonstrates the potential role of autosomal suppressors in preventing sex chromosome cycling and provides insights into the conditions and consequences of maintaining both Y-linked and autosomal suppressors.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Advances in the de novo design of proteins have enabled the design of protein binders with the potential to target epitopes with unique properties and faster production timelines compared to antibodies. Building upon our previous work combining a de novo-designed minibinder of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with the synthetic receptor synNotch (SARSNotch), we investigated whether minibinders can be readily adapted to a diversity of cell engineering tools. We show that the Spike minibinder LCB1 easily generalizes to a next-generation proteolytic receptor SNIPR that performs similarly to our previously reported SARSNotch. LCB1-SNIPR successfully enables the detection of live SARS-CoV-2, an improvement over SARSNotch which can only detect cell-expressed Spike. To test the generalizability of minibinders to diverse applications, we tested LCB1 as an antigen sensor for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). LCB1-CAR enabled CD8+ T cells to cytotoxically target Spike-expressing cells. We further demonstrate that two other minibinders directed against the clinically relevant epidermal growth factor receptor are able to drive CAR-dependent cytotoxicity with efficacy similar to or better than an existing antibody-based CAR.

This latter pathway is employed by the BNIP3/NIX receptors to trigger mitophagy.

A central question is how individual subunits within these complexes can evolve novel functions while maintaining the integrity of the original assembly. Here, we explore this question by tracing the evolutionary trajectory of the plant exocyst, an octameric complex essential for exocytosis in eukaryotes. Remarkably, the Exo70 subunit underwent dramatic expansion and functional divergence in plants. We demonstrate that electrostatic alterations in the N-terminal region of the Exo70 subunit precipitated its dissociation from the exocyst complex.

These price caps may reduce revenue for the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that negotiate the actual price paid for medicines in the US. To offset the resulting pressure on their profit margins, it is possible that PBMs would, in turn, increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines with capped prices. The model presented here evaluates how such increased out-of-pocket costs for the anticoagulants Eliquis (apixaban) and Xarelto (rivaroxaban) could impact patients financially and clinically.

MethodsCopay distributions for all 2023 prescription fills for Eliquis and Xarelto managed by the three largest PBMs were used to approximate current copay costs. Increased out-of-pocket costs were modeled as a shift of all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest copay tier. The known linear relationship between copay costs and treatment abandonment was used to calculate the potential resulting increase in treatment abandonment. Known rates of morbidity and mortality due to abandoning anticoagulants were used to estimate resulting increases in morbidity and mortality.

ResultsIf the three largest PBMs all shifted costs onto patients by moving all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest formulary tier, Tier 6, patients copay amount would increase by $235 to $482 million for Eliquis and $105 to $206 million for Xarelto. Such an increase could lead to 169,000 to 228,000 patients abandoning Eliquis and 71,000 to 93,000 abandoning Xarelto. The resulting morbidity and mortality could include up to an additional 145,000 major cardiovascular events and up to 97,000 more deaths.

ConclusionThe Medicare Price Negotiation Program could impact patients negatively if it causes PBMs to increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Policymakers should closely monitor changes in overall affordability, including all patient out-of-pocket expenditures, for medications in the program. Preemptive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens are not placed in precarious situations leading to poorer health outcomes should be considered.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698521

Acquisition is typically mediated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs), however, beyond plasmids, bacteriophages and certain integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), the nature and diversity of MGEs is poorly understood. The bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was propagated by serial transfer in the presence of filtrate obtained from garden compost communities. Genome sequencing of derived colonies revealed acquisition of three different mobile elements, each integrated immediately downstream of tmRNA. All are flanked by direct repeats and harbour a tyrosine integrase (intY), followed by a cargo of accessory genes including putative phage defence systems. Although characteristic of genomic islands, MGE-classifiers showed no matches to mobile elements. Interrogation of DNA sequence databases showed that similar elements are widespread in the genus Pseudomonas and beyond, with Vibrio Pathogenicity Island-1 (VPI-1) from V. cholerae being a notable example. Bioinformatic analyses demonstrate frequent transfer among diverse hosts. With focus on a single 55 kb element (I55) we show that intY is necessary for excision and circularisation, that the element is incapable of autonomous horizontal transfer, but is mobilizable -- in the absence of direct cell-cell contact -- upon addition of community filtrate. Further analyses demonstrate that I55 enhances host fitness in the presence of community filtrate, which stems in part from ability to defend against phages.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, the identities of RNAs whose localization is regulated by a specific RBP as well as the impacts of that RNA localization on cell function have generally remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the RBP HNRNPA2B1 acts to keep specific RNAs out of neuronal projections. Using subcellular fractionation, high-throughput sequencing, and single molecule RNA FISH, we find that hundreds of RNAs demonstrate markedly increased abundance in neurites in HNRNPA2B1 knockout cells. These RNAs often encode motor proteins and are enriched for known HNRNPA2B1 binding sites and motifs in their 3' UTRs. The speed and processivity of microtubule-based transport is impaired in these cells, specifically in their neurites. HNRNPA2B1 point mutations that increase its cytoplasmic abundance relative to wildtype lead to stronger suppression of RNA mislocalization defects than seen with wildtype HNRNPA2B1. We further find that the subcellular localizations of HNRNPA2B1 target RNAs are sensitive to perturbations of RNA decay machinery, suggesting that it is HNRNPA2B1s known role in regulating RNA stability that may explain these observations. These findings establish HNRNPA2B1 as a negative regulator of neurite RNA abundance and link the subcellular activities of motor proteins with the subcellular abundance of the RNAs that encode them.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word - and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the expectedness of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster - evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks - and that this effect is driven both by the words own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

This study investigates how molecular crowding, specifically the size and shape of crowders like Dextran and Ficoll, modulates the conformational states and phase separation behavior of Sup35NM. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and molecular dynamics simulations, we observed that Dextran, depending on its molecular weight, induces both compaction and expansion of Sup35NM, driving phase separation at certain thresholds. Notably, rod-like Dextran crowders promote phase separation, while spherical Ficoll does not, highlighting the impact of crowder geometry on IDP behavior. Computational modelling further revealed that the crowder shape influences Sup35NM's conformational ensemble by modulating intra- and inter-domain interactions. These findings elucidate the role of crowding agents in IDP phase behavior, suggesting that cellular crowding may regulate IDP functionality through conformational control.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Determining the origin time of genes facilitates the elucidation of crucial genetic mechanisms underlying significant biological evolutionary questions such as the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life, the emergence of mammals, the origin of humans, as well as the development of species- or lineage-specific traits. However, accurately determining the origin time of these genes in species separated by long evolutionary distances remains a major challenge in bioinformatics as these genes often undergo significant changes in their genome sequences, making it difficult to trace them back to their origin. Here, we proposed a new approach for dating gene age based on the micro- and macro-synteny algorithms. This approach employs the parallel computation of orthologous genome alignments across multiple species. Our method was integrated into the GageTracker (Gene Age Tracker) software, providing a fast and accurate way to trace gene age with minimal user input, available at https://github.com/RiversDong/GageTracker. Benchmarked against the simMammals dataset (Alignathon), GageTracker achieved the same high-quality genome alignments as the optimized LastZ aligner, but improved operation speed by 1.4-7 times. In a separate analysis of 12 Drosophila genomes, GageTracker efficiently assessed the ages of 23,720 genes (including ~13,965 protein-coding genes) in just ~22 hours with default parameters. When comparing with the GenTree database (recognized as the most comprehensive and accurate tool for evaluating gene age), GageTracker achieved an impressive ~94.4% accuracy and ~99% macro consistency in assessing the age of protein-coding genes. Moreover, for the ~5.6% conflicting genes, GageTracker displayed slightly higher support rates than GenTree, as evidenced by data from OrthoDB, FlyBase, and Ensembl ortholog databases. Notably, younger genes identified by GageTracker exhibited a preferential expression pattern in the testis, further reinforcing the reliability of GageTracker in accurately tracing gene age.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

The total diversity of geographic radiations of many Indo-Pacific fauna is often incompletely sampled in phylogenetic studies due to the difficulty in obtaining single island endemic forms across the Pacific and the relatively poor performance of degraded DNA when using museum specimens for inference of evolutionary relationships. New methods for production and analysis of genome-wide datasets sourced from degraded DNA are facilitating insights into the complex evolutionary histories of these influential island faunas. Here, we leverage whole genome resequencing (20X average coverage) and extensive sampling of all taxonomic diversity within Todiramphus kingfishers, a rapid radiation of largely island endemic ""Great Speciators."" We find that whole genome datasets do not outright resolve the evolutionary relationships of this clade: four types of molecular markers (UCEs, BUSCOs, SNPs, and mtDNA) and tree building methods did not find a single well-supported and concordant species-level topology. We then uncover evidence of widespread incomplete lineage sorting and both ancient and contemporary gene flow and demonstrate how these factors contribute to conflicting evolutionary histories. Our complete taxonomic sampling allowed us to further identify a novel case of mitochondrial capture between two allopatric species, suggesting a potential historical (but since lost) hybrid zone as islands were successively colonized.

Here, we show that the POL{gamma} Y951N disease causing mutation induces replication stalling and severe mtDNA depletion. However, unlike other POL{gamma} disease causing mutations, Y951N does not directly impair exonuclease activity and only mildly affects polymerase activity. Instead, we found that Y951N compromises the enzymes ability to efficiently toggle between DNA synthesis and degradation, and is thus the first patient-derived mutation with impaired polymerase-exonuclease switching. These findings provide new insights into the intramolecular switch when POL{gamma} proofreads the newly-synthesized DNA strand, and reveal a new mechanism for causing mitochondrial DNA instability.

Significance StatementDNA polymerase gamma (POL{gamma}) is essential for copying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is crucial for our energy production. POL{gamma} must accurately switch between making new DNA (polymerase activity) and correcting errors (exonuclease activity). While it is known that mutations in POL{gamma} can cause mitochondrial diseases by directly impairing these enzymatic functions, this study reveals a new mechanism. The Y951N mutation disrupts POL{gamma}s ability to switch between these activities, leading to severe blockages in DNA replication and a loss of mtDNA in human cells, even without significant direct impairment of polymerase or exonuclease activities. These findings provide new insights into the origins of mitochondrial diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

We examined whether this extended to alterations in circadian rhythms and sleep, such as those induced by chronic social defeat stress, using actigraphy and wireless EEG. CFA-induced inflammatory pain profoundly altered sleep architecture in male and female mice. Injection of the hind paw, whether with CFA or saline, reduced some measures of circadian rhythmicity such as variance, period, and amplitude. CFA increased sleep duration primarily in the dark phase, while sleep bout length was decreased in the light and increased in the dark phase. Additionally, CFA reduced wake bout length, especially during the dark phase. Increases in REM and SWS duration and bouts were most significant in the dark phase, regardless of whether CFA had been injected at its onset or 12 hours prior.

However, this carboxylic acid-containing lead had poor membrane permeability and other liabilities that made optimization difficult. Here, we developed a shape- based virtual screening pipeline - FrankenROCS - to identify new macrodomain inhibitors using fragment X-ray crystal structures. We used FrankenROCS to exhaustively screen the Enamine high-throughput screening (HTS) collection of 2.1 million compounds and selected 39 compounds for testing, with the most potent compound having an IC50 value equal to 130 M. We then paired FrankenROCS with an active learning algorithm (Thompson sampling) to efficiently search the Enamine REAL database of 22 billion molecules, testing 32 compounds with the most potent having an IC50 equal to 220 M. Further optimization led to analogs with IC50 values better than 10 M, with X-ray crystal structures revealing diverse binding modes despite conserved chemical features. These analogs represent a new lead series with improved membrane permeability that is poised for optimization.

Current therapeutics remain limited to direct acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral lifecycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an in vivo model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner; a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results pharmacologically validate Mac1 as a therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle.

Salt stress exacerbates high light stress in cyanobacteria and leads to severe yield losses in crop plants. Genetic traits that confer salt tolerance without compromising photosynthetic performance are essential for improving photosynthesis under these conditions. Here we applied accelerated evolution in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 by conditionally suppressing its methyl-directed mismatch repair system to obtain beneficial genetic traits for enhanced photosynthesis under salt stress. Screening over 10,000 mutants, we isolated eight strains with increased biomass or sucrose productivity under salt stress. Genome sequencing revealed an average of 8-20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or indels per genome. Notably, mutations in the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center D1 gene, resulting in the amino acid changes L353F, I358N, and H359N at the carboxyl terminus of the pre-D1 (pD1) protein, improve photosynthesis under salt and combined salt and light stress by potentially accelerating D1 maturation during PSII repair. Phylogenetic analysis of pD1 across cyanobacteria and red algae highlights the broad significance of these adaptive genetic traits, underscoring the importance of leveraging evolutionary insights to improve photosynthesis under stress or fluctuating environments.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, our current mechanistic understanding of these dysfunctions and relationships is imprecise.

Study DesignThe present study used mathematical modeling to uncover cognitive processes driving gaze perception abnormalities in SZ and BD, and how they relate to cognition, symptoms, and social functioning. We modeled the behavior of 28 SZ, 38 BD, and 34 controls (HC) in a self-referential gaze perception task using drift-diffusion models (DDM) parameterized to index key cognitive components: drift rate (evidence accumulation efficiency), drift bias (perceptual bias), start point (expectation bias), threshold separation (response caution), and non- decision time (encoding/motor processes).

Study ResultsResults revealed that aberrant gaze perception in SZ and BD was driven by less efficient evidence accumulation, perceptual biases predisposing self-referential responses, and greater caution (SZ only). Across SZ and HC, poorer social functioning was related to greater expectation biases. Within SZ, perceptual and expectancy biases were associated with hallucination and delusion severity, respectively.

ConclusionsThese findings indicate that diminished evidence accumulation and perceptual biases may underlie altered gaze perception in patients and that SZ may engage in compensatory cautiousness, sacrificing response speed to preserve accuracy. Moreover, biases at the belief and perceptual levels may relate to symptoms and functioning. Computational modeling can, therefore, be used to achieve a more nuanced, cognitive process-level understanding of the mechanisms of social cognitive difficulties, including gaze perception, in individuals with SZ and BD.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698521

Interference with transcription factors can lead to counter-silencing of XS target promoters but typically requires promoter engineering. In this study, we developed a novel CRISPR/dCas-mediated counter-silencing (CRISPRcosi) approach by using nuclease-deficient dCas enzymes to counteract the Lsr2-like XS protein CgpS in Corynebacterium glutamicum or Lsr2 in Streptomyces venezuelae. Systematic in vivo reporter studies with dCas9 and dCas12a and various guide RNAs revealed effective counter-silencing of different CgpS target promoters in response to guide RNA/dCas DNA binding, independent of promoter sequence modifications. The most prominent CRISPRcosi effect was observed when targeting the CgpS nucleation site, an effect that was also seen in S. venezuelae when targeting a known Lsr2 nucleation site. Analyzing the system in strains lacking the XS protein CgpS revealed varying strengths of counteracting CRISPR interference effects based on the target position and strand. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling in sgRNA/dCas9 co-expressing wild-type strains revealed high counter-silencing specificity with minimal off-target effects. Thus, CRISPRcosi provides a promising system for the precise upregulation of XS target genes with significant potential for studying gene networks as well as for developing applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Trafficking of a model protein LiveDrop between the ER and LDs occurs by diffusion through seipin-associated ER-LD membrane bridges that allow bidirectional protein movement. Unexpectedly, LiveDrop moves with the same apparent diffusion coefficient in the ER and LDs, but becomes molecularly confined at LD surfaces through a mechanism requiring its tryptophan residues. These data show how a specific LD-targeting membrane sequence leads to confined motion and LD protein accumulation, and directly demonstrate intra-organellar protein trafficking through membrane contact sites.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

This is revealed by genomic data from over 400 samples across Eurasia. We found over 30 previously undescribed autotetraploid populations in Siberia with a minimum of two separate origins, independent of those previously reported in Central Europe. The establishment of Siberian tetraploids is mediated by meiotic adaptation at the same genes as in European tetraploid A. lyrata and Arabidopsis arenosa, despite high divergence and geographical separation. Haplotype analysis based on synthetic long-read assemblies supports the long-range introgression of adaptive alleles from the tetraploid interspecific pool of European A. lyrata and A. arenosa to tetraploid Siberian A. lyrata.

We further employ our model to explore the emergence of EMT states in spatial transcriptomics data, uncovering hybrid EMT niches with contrasting potential for antitumour immunity or immune evasion.

Prior modeling approaches have accounted for the adaptive immune systems role in combating tumors, which has led to the development of stochastic models that explain cancer immunoediting and tumor-immune co-evolution. However, cancer immunemediated dormancy, wherein the adaptive immune system maintains a micrometastatic population by keeping its growth in check, remains poorly understood. Immune-mediated dormancy can significantly delay the emergence (and therefore detection) of metastasis. An improved quantitative understanding of this process will thereby improve our ability to identify and treat cancer during the micrometastatic period. Here, we introduce a generalized stochastic model that incorporates the dynamic effects of immunomodulation within the tumor microenvironment on T cell-mediated cancer killing. This broad class of nonlinear birth-death model can account for a variety of cytotoxic T cell immunosuppressive effects, including regulatory T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We develop analytic expressions for the likelihood and mean time of immune escape. We also develop a method for identifying a corresponding diffusion approximation applicable to estimating population dynamics across a wide range of nonlinear birth-death processes. Lastly, we apply our model to estimate the nature and extent of immunomodulation that best explains the timing of disease recurrence in bladder and breast cancer patients. Our findings quantify the effects that stochastic tumor-immune interaction dynamics can play in the timing and likelihood of disease progression. Our analytical approximations provide a method of studying population escape in other ecological contexts involving nonlinear transition rates.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

GNAL encodes Golf, a heterotrimeric G-protein  subunit with a defined molecular function to increase the production of the second messenger cAMP. Golf is abundant in the striatum, and is the only stimulatory G-protein in many cell types of the striatum. Due to the defined molecular signaling pathway and expression pattern of Golf, the clear genetic link to dystonia makes GNAL an exciting target to understand the pathological mechanisms of not only this genetic dystonia, but also the larger idiopathic disease. To better understand GNAL-linked dystonia, we generated a novel genetic mouse model that allows us to conditionally knock out Gnal in a site and time-specific manner. In the current study we used genetic or AAV based approaches to express Cre to knockout striatal Gnal in our novel Gnal fl/fl model. We then performed motor behavioral testing and ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of striatal spiny projection neurons to interrogate how loss of Gnal leads to dystonia. Mice with conditional striatal knockout of Gnal show hindlimb clasping, other dystonia-like postures, less motor coordination, slowness, and torticollis as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, striatal spiny projection neurons show increased excitability in Gnal knockout animals. These exciting data are the first to report uninduced, overt dystonia in a mouse model of GNAL-linked dystonia, and directly correlate these with changes in spiny projection neuron electrophysiological properties. Our results show that adult loss of Gnal in the striatum leads to the development of dystonia, through homeostatic, paradoxical increases in spiny projection neuron excitability, and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at decreasing this hyperexcitable phenotype may provide symptomatic relief for patients with disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Here, we examine AcrIF11, a widespread phage and plasmid-encoded ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) that inhibits the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. We present an NMR structure of an AcrIF11 homolog that reveals chemical shift perturbations consistent with NAD (cofactor) binding. In experiments that model both lytic phage replication and MGE/lysogen stability under high targeting pressure, AcrIF11 is a highly potent CRISPR-Cas inhibitor and more robust to Cas protein level fluctuations than stoichiometric inhibitors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AcrIF11 is remarkably specific, predominantly ADP-ribosylating Csy1 when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Given the reversible nature of ADP-ribosylation, we hypothesized that ADPr eraser enzymes (macrodomains) could remove ADPr from Csy1, a potential limitation of PTM-based CRISPR inhibition. We demonstrate that diverse macrodomains can indeed remove the modification from Csy1 in P. aeruginosa lysate.

In this study, we assess the utility of Y-chromosomal microsatellites to detect founder effect in the Faroe Islands through the construction of haplotype networks and a novel empirical method, mutational distance from modal haplotype histograms (MDM), for the visualization and evaluation of population bottlenecks. We compared samples from the Faroe Islands and Iceland to possible regional source populations and documented a loss of diversity associated with founder events. Additionally, within-haplogroup diversity statistics reveals lower haplotype diversity and richness within both the Faroe Islands and Iceland, consistent with a small founder population colonizing both regions. However, in the within-haplogroup networks, the Faroe Islands are found within the larger set of potential source populations while Iceland is consistently found on isolated branches. Moreover, comparisons of within-haplogroup MDM histograms document a clear founder signal in the Faroes and Iceland, but the strength of this signal is haplogroup-dependent which may be indicative of more recent admixture or other demographic processes. The results of the current study and lack of conformity between Icelandic and Faroese haplotypes implies that the two populations were founded by different paternal gene pools and there is no detectable post-founder admixture between the two groups.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Dispersal of haplogroup L from the Near East played a major role in the formation of an agriculturist population that formed an intermediary between the primitive tribes and the R1a-rich priestly group. This study shows that the frequency of R1a in the hunter-gatherer tribes (1.5%) is much lower than previously reported based on other models of population clustering.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

To determine how the biotic and abiotic conditions in an insectary affect the composition of the bacterial microbiome of mosquitoes we reared mosquitoes from a single cohort of eggs from one genetically homogeneous inbred Aedes aegypti colony, which were split into three batches, and transferred to each of three different insectaries located within the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. Using three replicate trays per insectary, we assessed and compared the bacterial microbiome composition as mosquitoes developed from these eggs. We also characterised the microbiome of the mosquitoes' food sources, measured environmental conditions over time in each climate-controlled insectary, and recorded development and survival of mosquitoes. While mosquito development was overall similar between all three insectaries, we saw differences in microbiome composition between mosquitoes from each insectary. Furthermore, bacterial input via food sources, potentially followed by selective pressure of temperature stability and range, did affect the microbiome composition. At both adult and larval stages, specific members of the mosquito microbiome were associated with particular insectaries; and the insectary with less stable and cooler conditions resulted in slower pupation rate and higher diversity of the larval microbiome. Tray and cage effects were also seen in all insectaries, with different bacterial taxa implicated between insectaries. These results highlight the necessity of considering the variability and effects of different microbiome composition even in experiments carried out in a laboratory environment starting with eggs from one batch; and highlights the impact of even minor inconsistencies in rearing conditions due to variation of temperature and humidity.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Recent developments of computer vision tools enable the automatic quantification of behaviours, supplementing or even replacing manual annotations. However, widespread adoption of these methods is still limited, due to the lack of annotated training datasets and domain-specific knowledge required to optimize these models for animal research. Here, we present YOLO-Behaviour, a flexible framework for identifying visually distinct behaviours from video recordings. The framework is robust, easy to implement, and requires minimal manual annotations as training data. We demonstrate the flexibility of the framework with case studies for event-wise detection in house sparrow nestling provisioning, Siberian jay feeding, human eating behaviours, and frame-wise detections of various behaviours in pigeons, zebras, and giraffes. Our results show that the framework reliably detects behaviours accurately, and retrieve comparable accuracy metrics to manual annotation. However, metrics extracted for event-wise detection were less correlated with manual annotation, and potential reasons for the discrepancy between manual annotation and automatic detection are discussed. To mitigate this problem, the framework can be used as a hybrid approach of first detecting events using the pipeline and then manually confirming the detections, saving annotation time. We provide detailed documentation and guidelines on how to implement the YOLO-Behaviour framework, for researchers to readily train and deploy new models on their own study systems. We anticipate the framework can be another step towards lowering the barrier of entry for applying computer vision methods in animal behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, the origin of this heterogeneity and how it regulates HSC phenotype is unclear. We show that during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) in the mouse embryo, dynamic changes in mitochondrial activity drive the production of mature HSCs with differing potencies. Lowering mitochondrial activity in the AGM by pharmacological or genetic means activates Wnt signaling to promote HSC expansion. Further, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) gives rise to functional heterogeneity in the definitive HSC pool. In-vitro and in-vivo functional assays, and single-cell transcriptomics on AGM HSCs showed that MMPlow HSCs are myeloid-biased, with enhanced differentiation potential, while MMPhigh HSCs are lymphoid-biased with diminished differentiation potential. Mechanistically, low mitochondrial activity upregulates Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling to promote HSC differentiation. These insights into the initiation of metabolic heterogeneity could be leveraged to isolate HSCs to efficiently generate desired lineages.

Despite numerous methods proposed in recent years, a systematic understanding of the best solution is still lacking.

ResultsHere, we systematically evaluate 47 highly variable gene (HVG) selection methods, consisting of 21 baseline methods developed based on different data transformations and mean-variance adjustment techniques and 26 hybrid methods developed based on mixtures of baseline methods. Across 19 diverse benchmark datasets, 18 objective evaluation criteria per method, and 5,358 analysis settings, we observe that no single baseline method consistently outperforms the others across all datasets and criteria. However, hybrid methods as a group robustly outperform individual baseline methods. Based on these findings, a new HVG selection approach, mixture HVG selection (mixHVG), that incorporates top-ranked features from multiple baseline methods is proposed as a better solution to HVG selection. An open source R package mixhvg is developed to enable convenient use of mixHVG and its integration into users data analysis pipelines.

ConclusionOur benchmark study not only provides a systematic comparison of existing methods, leading to a better HVG selection solution, but also creates a pipeline and resource consisting of diverse benchmark data and criteria for evaluating new methods in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

A tradeoff between these objectives is well-documented in microbes, where it is caused by the need to partition the total cellular protein content between growth- and survival-enhancing proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of growth-survival tradeoffs in multicellular animals remain largely unknown. Here, we addressed this mechanism for C. elegans by measuring the dynamic changes of its proteome during starvation using live imaging and proteomics. We found that starved animals catabolize ribosomal proteins through autophagy, which provides essential energy for survival while preserving organismal integrity. However, the resulting decline in ribosomes delayed growth resumption upon refeeding until pre-starvation ribosome levels were restored. Genetic inhibition of ribosomal autophagy had a dual effect: although it accelerated growth after short starvation, it compromised survival during prolonged starvation. These findings reveal the rate of ribosomal catabolism as a key determinant of a tradeoff between starvation survival and rapid growth resumption whose tuning may adapt animals to different starvation durations. Our research shows how the need to balance protein allocation between growth and survival constrains animal physiology, highlighting the mechanistic role of proteome resource limitation in whole-organism tradeoffs.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Based on density maps from X-ray diffraction or cryogenic-sample electron microscopy (cryoEM), scientists verify whether small-molecule ligands bind to active sites of interest. However, the interpretation of density maps is challenging, and cognitive bias can sometimes mislead investigators into modeling fictitious compounds. Ligand identification can be aided by automatic methods, but existing approaches are available only for X-ray diffraction and are based on iterative fitting or feature-engineered machine learning rather than end-to-end deep learning.

ResultsHere, we propose to identify ligands using a deep learning approach that treats density maps as 3D point clouds. We show that the proposed model is on par with existing machine learning methods for X-ray crystallography while also being applicable to cryoEM density maps. Our study demonstrates that electron density map fragments can be used to train models that can be applied to cryoEM structures, but also highlights challenges associated with the standardization of electron microscopy maps and the quality assessment of cryoEM ligands.

Currently there is a lack of experimental models to study such interactions under defined in vitro conditions. Here, we developed a Porcine Nasal Organoid (PNO) system from nasal tissue of pigs as well as from cytological brushes. PNOs exhibited similar structure and cell types than the nasal mucosa, as evaluated by immunostaining. PNOs were inoculated with porcine commensal strains of Moraxella pluranimalium, Rothia nasimurium and the pathobiont Glaesserella parasuis for examining host-commensal-pathogen interactions. All strains adhered to the PNOs, although at different levels. M. pluranimalium and G. parasuis strains stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas R. nasimurium induced the production of IFN{gamma} and diminished the proinflammatory effect of the other strains. Overall, PNOs mimic the in vivo nasal mucosa and can be useful to perform host-microbe interaction studies.

As the drug dose approaches the MIC and regardless of the mode of action, our results show a consistent increase in growth rate heterogeneity. Remarkably, drugs that affect protein synthesis consistently show the opposite trend, reducing heterogeneity. We hypothesize that growth rate heterogeneity under antibiotic treatment might therefore depend on the functional distance of the target from ribosomal activity, which is key in determining growth rate. Low heterogeneity is desirable from a clinical perspective, as the opposite is often associated to persistence and antibiotic survival. For all of the antibiotics and species tested, we also find a striking and non-trivial correlation between morphological alterations and growth inhibition. This observation allows us to introduce a new morphological parameter, MOR50, that enables the estimation of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) with a single snapshot after 2.5 hours of incubation.

They are involved in the biosynthesis of primary and specialized metabolites, including salicylic acid (SA), a key defense phytohormone synthesized via the conserved chorismate biosynthetic pathway. However, the identity of the signal(s) that ultimately triggers SA induction in chloroplasts upon perception of a biotic threat has remained elusive. Here, we provide evidence of a functional link between chloroplast-derived reactive oxygen species (cROS) and SA production. We observe that inhibiting ROS bursts generated from photosystem II during plant immune activation completely abrogates the induction of SA synthesis in response to immunity-inducing signals, without affecting SA-independent immune responses. Indeed, time course analyses show that the induction of SA marker genes parallels that of cROS production during an immune response. Consistent with this, preventing cROS induction is sufficient to nullify the immune protection normally conferred by activating immunity prior to an infection. Analyses of transcriptomes and photosynthetic efficiency show that two conserved effectors from the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae, HopM1 and AvrE1, redundantly disrupt photosynthesis and cROS bursts. These effects reduce SA accumulation and are mediated via the impact of HopM1 and AvrE1 in inducting host abscisic acid signaling. Our results suggest that a change in chloroplastic redox homeostasis induced by biotic stressors acts as an initiator of plant immunity through the production of SA, and that this response is targeted by conserved pathogen effector proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

T cells, in particular, leverage their unique T cell receptors (TCRs) to detect specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-presented peptides. TCR activation is then relayed via linker for activation of T cells (LAT), a TCR-proximal disordered adapter protein, which organizes protein partners and mediates the propagation of signals down diverse pathways including NFAT and AP-1. Here, we studied how balanced downstream pathway activation is encoded in the amino acid sequence of LAT. To comprehensively profile the sequence-function relationship of LAT, we developed a pooled, single-cell, high-content screening approach in which a large series of mutants in the LAT protein were analyzed to characterize their effects on T cell activation. Measuring epigenetic, transcriptomic, and cell surface protein dynamics of single cells harboring distinct LAT mutants, we found functional regions spanning over 40% of the LAT amino acid sequence. Conserved sequence motifs for protein interactions along with charge distribution are critical sequence features, and contribute to interpretation of human genetic variation in LAT. While mutant defect severity spans from moderate to complete loss of function, nearly all defective mutants, irrespective of their position in LAT, confer balanced defects across all downstream pathways. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we performed proximal protein labeling which demonstrated that disruption of LAT interaction with a single partner protein indirectly disrupts other partner interactions, likely through the dual roles of these proteins as effectors of downstream pathways and bridging factors between LAT molecules. Overall, we report widely distributed functional regions throughout a disordered adapter and a precise physical organization of LAT and interacting molecules which constrains signaling outputs. More broadly, we describe an approach for interrogating sequence-function relationships for proteins with complex activities across regulatory layers of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, fundamental questions about the causes and consequences of L1 activity in cancer genomes remain unresolved, primarily due to the limitations of short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we employ multiplatform sequencing, with an emphasis on long reads, to analyse a fine selection of 10 tumours exhibiting high rates of somatic retrotransposition, encompassing over 6000 events. The analysis of L1 locus-specific single-nucleotide variants reveals a novel panorama of L1 loci activity. Furthermore, examination of the internal structure of somatic L1s uncovers the mechanisms behind their inactivation. A hidden landscape of chromosomal aberrations emerges in the light of long reads, where reciprocal translocations mediated by L1 insertion represent frequent events. Resolution of L1 bridges configuration elucidates the mechanisms of their formation, where typically two independent, but synchronous, somatic L1 insertions drive the reciprocal exchange between non-homologous chromosomes. Timing analyses indicate that L1 retrotransposition is an early driver of chromosomal instability, active before the first whole-genome doubling event. Overall, these findings highlight L1 activity as a more significant contributor to tumour genome plasticity than previously recognized, extending its impact beyond simple insertional mutagenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding prin- ciples, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2s high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow re- gion of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape -- more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2s learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 interme- diate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2s energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

However, whether 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in non-human mammals can establish human infections and spread among humans is unclear. Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals. Overall, our study delineates human adaptation and infection risk of specific non-human mammalian circulating HPAI 2.3.4.4b H5N1 strains.

One such inhibitor, the gating-modifier peptide Protoxin-I derived from tarantula venom, blocks channel opening by shifting the activation voltage threshold to more depolarised potentials, but the structural basis for this inhibition has not previously been determined. Using monolayer graphene grids, we report the cryogenic electron microscopy structures of full-length human apo-NaV1.8 and the Protoxin-I-bound complex at 3.1 [A] and 2.8 [A] resolution, respectively.

A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, i.e. a hypoxic niche, a leading-edge niche, and a perivascular niche, in which malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, by analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data of human GBM and transgenic mouse models of GBM, we unexpectedly identified pericytes, mural cells intimately associated with the endothelium, as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Exclusive signaling axes emanating from pericytes were received by endothelial cells, malignant cells, astrocytes, and immune cells. Depletion of pericytes through genetic engineering in several different transgenic and orthotopic mouse models of GBM demonstrated accelerated tumor progression, a disrupted blood-brain-barrier, and premature death of pericyte-poor mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that pericyte deficiency altered the cellular composition of GBM, remodeled the endothelium, and impacted on the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, endothelial cells deprived of pericyte association altered their signaling programs, which in turn attracted perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immune-suppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages expressed Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), which reinforced activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring an extreme mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1 within hypoxic regions. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of isolated, MET-expressing GBM cells corroborated their superior tumor-initiating capability and invasive phenotype. In patients, low expression of a pericyte core gene signature was reduced in recurrent GBM, compared to primary tumors. Consistently, gene signatures for transcriptional programs of Fosl1+Met+ GBM cells were indicative of poor survival in human tumors, and spatial transcriptomics corroborated their superior invasive capacity. Taken together, we infer that the pericyte represents a critical modulator of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment; our findings thus highlight the importance of pericyte preservation in the face of current and future GBM therapies.

While our findings indicate and support that this is a robust and pharmacologically tractable model for investigating the molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of (G4C2) repeat driven DPR pathology, it is not suitable for investigating the development of disease associated neurodegeneration, TDP-43 dysfunction, gliosis, and motor performance. Our findings underscore the complexity of ALS pathogenesis involving genetic mutations and protein dysregulation and highlight the need for more comprehensive model systems that reliably replicate the multifaceted cellular and behavioral aspects of C9-ALS.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Owing to its use of the StripedHyena architecture, LoRNASH handles extremely long sequence inputs ([~]65 kilobase pairs), allowing for quantitative, zero-shot prediction of all aspects of transcriptome architecture, including isoform abundance, isoform structure, and the impact of DNA sequence variants on transcript structure and abundance.

To mitigate the issue, tools such as the widely used Percolator and PeptideProphet leverage machine learning for rescoring. Though this can boost peptide and protein identification rates, the fact that they are trained to separate targets from decoys can lead to inaccurate false-discovery rate (FDR) estimates. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to peptide-spectrum matching, based on a pre-trained large deep learning model, which does not utilize decoys during training and does not require training a new model for every new sample. We trained the Tesorai model on over 100M real peptide-spectrum pairs and demonstrated that the approach performs robustly across a wide range of use cases including standard trypsin-digested human samples, immunopeptidomics, metaproteomics, single-cell and isobaric-labeled samples. In addition to providing robust FDR control, our method increases identifications by up to 170%. Furthermore, we incorporated it into a cloud-native, end-to-end system that can process hundreds of samples in just a few hours.

Yet, the low signal-to-noise ratio, characteristic of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq), challenges quantitative analyses. We have shown that gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis can help overcome this obstacle and support mechanistic elucidation of cellular state determinants, for example by using the VIPER algorithm to identify Master Regulator (MR) proteins from gene expression data. A key challenge, as the size and complexity of scRNASeq datasets grow, is the need for highly scalable tools supporting the analysis of large-scale datasets with up to hundreds of thousands of cells. To address it, we introduce pyVIPER, a fast, memory-efficient, and highly scalable Python toolkit for assessing protein activity in large-scale scRNASeq datasets. pyVIPER supports multiple enrichment analysis algorithms, data transformation/postprocessing modules, a novel data structure for GRNs manipulation, and seamless integration with AnnData, Scanpy and several widely adopted machine learning libraries. Compared to VIPER, benchmarking reveals orders of magnitude runtime reduction for large datasets--i.e., from hours to minutes-- thus supporting VIPER-based analysis of virtually any large-scale single-cell dataset, as well as integration with other Python-based tools.

The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Previous methods focused on higher heteroplasmy mutations that are limited in number and can be influenced by functional selection, introducing biases for lineage tracing. Although more challenging to detect, intermediate to low heteroplasmy mtDNA mutations are valuable due to their high diversity, abundance, and lower propensity to selection. To enhance mtDNA mutation detection and facilitate fine-scale lineage tracing, we developed the single-cell Regulatory multi-omics with Deep Mitochondrial mutation profiling (ReDeeM) approach, an integrated experimental and computational framework. Recently, some concerns have been raised about the analytical workflow in the ReDeeM framework. Specifically, it was noted that the mutations detected in a single molecule per cell are enriched on edges of mtDNA molecules, suggesting they resemble artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. It was then proposed that all mutations found in one molecule per cell should be removed. We detail our error correction method, demonstrating that the observed edge mutations are distinct from previously reported sequencing artifacts. We further show that the proposed removal leads to massive elimination of bona fide and informative mutations. Indeed, mutations accumulating on edges impact a minority of all mutation calls (for example, in hematopoietic stem cells, the excess mutations on the edge account for only 4.3%-7.6% of the total). Recognizing the value of addressing edge mutations even after applying consensus correction, we provide an additional filtering option in the ReDeeM-R package. This approach effectively eliminates the position biases, leads to a mutational signature indistinguishable from bona fide mitochondrial mutations, and removes excess low molecule high connectedness mutations. Importantly, this option preserves the large majority of unique mutations identified by ReDeeM, maintaining the ability of ReDeeM to provide a more than 10-fold increase in variant detection compared to previous methods. Additionally, the cells remain well-connected. While there is room for further refinement in mutation calling strategies, the significant advances and biological insights provided by the ReDeeM framework are unique and remain intact. We hope that this detailed discussion and analysis enables the community to employ this approach and contribute to its further development.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds). MSMRs for the human and bonobo X chromosomes did not significantly differ.","NA","biorxiv",1725055698521

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698521

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725055698522
