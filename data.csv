The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Besides the CTCF/cohesin machinery, only a few nuclear factors have been studied for a direct role in physically connecting regulatory elements. Here, we show via acute degradation experiments that LDB1 directly and broadly promotes enhancer-promoter loops. Most LDB1-mediated contacts, even those spanning hundreds of kb, can form in the absence of CTCF, cohesin, or YY1 as determined via the use of multiple degron systems. Moreover, an engineered LDB1-driven chromatin loop is cohesin independent. Cohesin-driven loop extrusion does not stall at LDB1 occupied sites but may aid the formation of a subset of LDB1 anchored loops. Leveraging the dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture during the transition from mitosis to G1-phase, we establish a relationship between LDB1-dependent interactions in the context of TAD organization and gene activation. Lastly, Tri-C and Region Capture Micro-C reveal that LDB1 organizes multi-enhancer networks to activate transcription. This establishes LDB1 as a direct driver of regulatory network inter-connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Materials and methodsA compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model was adapted to reflect COVID-19 cases in the UK. Numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19- related hospitalizations and deaths, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were predicted using a decision tree. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of an updated Moderna mRNA vaccine (Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign) was compared to no Autumn 2024 vaccine and to an updated Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Autumn 2024 vaccine, from a healthcare perspective.

ResultsThe Moderna Autumn 2024 Vaccination Campaign is predicted to decrease the expected 8.3 million symptomatic infections with no vaccination by 19% to 6.7 million. Hospitalizations, long COVID cases, and deaths are expected to decline by 27,000 (-38%), 59,000 (-19%), and 6000 (-43%), respectively. The Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign will increase QALYs by 78,000 and costs by {pound}665 million, yielding an ICER of {pound}8500/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses suggest that vaccine effectiveness (VE) and waning, symptomatic infection incidence, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates drive cost-effectiveness. Vaccination remains cost-effective when lowering the target population to [&ge;]50 years. Use of the Moderna vaccine is expected to prevent 8000 more hospitalizations and 1700 more deaths than the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

ConclusionsVaccination of the eligible population would contribute to significant reductions in hospitalizations, deaths, and long COVID in the UK in the 2024-2025 season. Expanding the target population continues to be cost-effective. Use of the Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign is predicted to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections and associated outcomes in a cost-effective manner and will contribute to a more resilient healthcare system in the UK.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653947

Even very young infants engage in active visual selection, looking less and less as stimuli are repeated (habituation) and regaining interest when novel stimuli are subsequently introduced (dishabituation). The mechanisms underlying these looking time changes remain uncertain, however, due to limits on both the scope of existing formal models and the empirical precision of measurements of infant behavior. We developed the Rational Action, Noisy Choice for Habituation (RANCH) model, which operates over raw images and makes quantitative predictions of participants' looking behaviors. In a series of pre-registered experiments, we measured infants' and adults' looking time across a range of stimulus exposure durations for both repeated and novel stimuli and showed that they were predicted by RANCH. Our model also makes out-of-sample predictions about the magnitude of adult and infant dishabituation to a range of novel stimuli in an independent experiment. By framing looking behaviors as rational decision-making, this work identified how the dynamics of learning and exploration guide our visual attention from infancy through adulthood.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Determination of a 3.6 A inward-facing crystal structure lacking the cytoplasmic N-and C-tails, molecular dynamics (MD), and functional studies have led to speculative models of its transport mechanism and determination of substrate specificity. Here, we report full-length cryo-EM structures of UapA in new inward-facing apo- and substrate-loaded conformations at 2.05-3.5 A in detergent and lipid nanodiscs. The structures reveal in an unprecedented level of detail the role of water molecules and lipids in substrate binding, specificity, dimerization, and activity, rationalizing accumulated functional data. Unexpectedly, the N-tail is structured and interacts with both the core and scaffold domains. This finding, combined with mutational and functional studies and MD, points out how N-tail interactions couple proper subcellular trafficking and transport activity by wrapping UapA in a conformation necessary for ER-exit and but also critical for elevator-type conformational changes associated with substrate translocation once UapA has integrated into the plasma membrane. Our study provides detailed insights into important aspects of the elevator-type transport mechanism and opens novel issues on how the evolution of extended cytosolic tails in eukaryotic transporters, apparently needed for subcellular trafficking, might have been integrated into the transport mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

What factors determine whether a precursor cell differentiates or retains the capacity to divide? Here, we leverage the developmental flexibility of the stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) in Arabidopsis leaves as a model for how flexible decisions are regulated. Using a quantitative approach that combines long-term live imaging and statistical modeling, we discover that cell size is a strong predictor of SLGC behaviour: larger SLGCs divide less often than smaller cells. We propose that cell size is linked to division behaviour at multiple spatial scales. At the neighbourhood scale, cell size correlates with the strength of cell-cell signaling, which affects the rate at which SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a division-promoting transcription factor, is degraded. At the subcellular scale, cell size correlates with nuclear size, which modulates the concentration of SPCH in the nucleus. Our work shows how initial differences in SPCH levels are canalized by nuclear size and cell-cell signaling to inform the behaviour of a flexible cell type.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35,000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Multiple p-tau biomarkers on several analytical platforms are poised for clinical use. The Alzheimers Association Global Biomarker Standardisation Consortium plasma phospho-tau Round Robin study engaged assay developers in a blinded case-control study on plasma p-tau, aiming to learn which assays provide the largest fold-changes in AD compared to non-AD, have the strongest relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and show the most consistent relationships between methods (commutability) in measuring both patient samples and candidate reference materials (CRM). METHODS: Thirty-three different p-tau biomarker assays, built on eight different analytical platforms, were used to quantify paired plasma and CSF samples from 40 participants. AD biomarker status was categorised as AD pathology (n=25) and non-AD pathology (n=15) by CSF A{beta}42/A{beta}40 (US-FDA; CE-IVDR) and p-tau181 (CE-IVDR) methods. The commutability of four CRM, at three concentrations, was assessed across assays. FINDINGS: Plasma p-tau217 consistently demonstrated higher fold-changes between AD and non-AD pathology groups, compared to other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 assays provided the highest median fold-changes. In CSF, p-tau217 assays also performed best, and exhibited substantially larger fold-changes than their plasma counterparts, despite similar diagnostic performance. P-tau217 showed the strongest correlations between plasma assays (rho=0.81 to 0.97). Plasma p-tau levels were weakly-to-moderately correlated with CSF p-tau, and correlations were non-significant within the AD group alone. The evaluated CRM were not commutable across assays. INTERPRETATION: Plasma p-tau217 measures had larger fold-changes and discriminative accuracies for detecting AD pathology, and better agreement across platforms than other plasma p-tau variants. Plasma and CSF markers of p-tau, measured by immunoassays, are not substantially correlated, questioning the interchangeability of their continuous relationship. Further work is warranted to understand the pathophysiology underlying this dissociation, and to develop suitable reference materials facilitating cross-assay standardisation.

We performed a 48-week double-blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled decentralized study (Participatory Evaluation of Aging with Rapamycin for Longevity [PEARL]; NCT04488601; registration date 2020-07-28) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rapamycin in mitigating clinical signs of aging in a normative aging cohort. Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week. Future work will aim to identify biometric signatures of clinical effectiveness to inform personalized treatment strategies that more broadly maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653947

Here, we established an analytical framework for the joint analysis of large MSI datasets that allows for the construction of multidimensional metabolomic atlases. Employing this framework, we mapped the 4D distribution of over a hundred lipids at quasi-single-cell resolution in Danio rerio embryos. We discovered metabolic trajectories that unfold in concert with morphogenesis and revealed spatially organized biochemical coordination overlooked by bulk measurements. Interestingly, lipid mapping revealed unexpected distributions of sphingolipid and triglyceride species, suggesting their involvement in pattern establishment and organ development. Our approach empowers a new generation of whole-organism metabolomic atlases and enables the discovery of spatially organized metabolic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

It has long been hypothesised that vesicles are directionally transported along phragmoplast microtubules by motor proteins. However, the mechanisms governing the accumulation and immobilisation of vesicles at the phragmoplast midzone remain elusive, and the motor protein responsible has yet to be identified. Here, we show that the plant-specific class II Kinesin-12 (Kinesin12-II) functions as a motor protein that drives vesicle transport towards the phragmoplast midzone in the moss Physcomitrium patens. In kinesin12-II mutants, the directional movement of cell plate materials towards the midzone and their retention were abolished, resulting in delayed cell plate formation and phragmoplast disassembly. A macroscopic phenotype arising from Kinesin12-II disruption was the impediment to gametophore development. We showed that this defect was attributable to the production of aneuploid cells in the early gametophore, where chromosome missegregation occurred because of the incomplete disassembly of phragmoplast microtubules in the preceding cell cycle. These findings suggest that plant Kinesin-12 has evolved to acquire a unique and critical function that facilitates cell plate formation in the presence of phragmoplasts.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Yet, the mechanism of neurodegeneration in MPS VII remains elusive thereby limiting the scope of targeted intervention. To address this, we recently developed a {beta}-glucuronidase-deficient (CG2135-/-) Drosophila model of MPS VII. The CG2135-/- flies exhibited signs of neuromuscular degeneration, including loss of dopaminergic neurons, and accumulated engorged lysosomes, ubiquitinated proteins and mitochondria in their brains. These observations, coupled with our current finding that the CG2135-/- flies were highly susceptible to starvation, prompted us to investigate potential defects in the autophagy-lysosomal clearance machinery in the fly brain. We found that both autophagy induction and lysosome-mediated autophagosomal turnover were impaired in the CG2135-/- fly brain. This was evidenced by lower Atg8a-II levels, reduced Atg1 and Ref(2)P expression along with accumulation of lipofuscin-like inclusions and multilamellar bodies. Interestingly, mitophagy was also found to be defective in their brain, causing buildup of enlarged mitochondria with distorted cristae and reduced membrane potential. This, in turn, affected mitochondrial function as reflected by drastically reduced brain ATP levels. Energy depletion triggered apoptosis in neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells of the CG2135-/- fly brain, where we also detected TUNEL-positive dopaminergic neurons. Resveratrol treatment, previously found to protect against loss of dopaminergic neurons in the CG2135-/- flies, has now been shown act by correcting the mitophagy defect and preventing ATP depletion. Collectively, our study establishes a causal link between mitophagy defect, mitochondrial malfunction, and neurodegeneration in MPS VII.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Whether growth conditions affect other stages of replication beyond initiation, remains to be systematically studied. To address this, we assess the replication dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium that undergoes only single round of replication per cell cycle, by tracking the replisome across various growth phases and nutrient conditions. We find that the replication elongation rates slowdown as cells transition from exponential (high-nutrient) to stationary (low-nutrient) phase, and this contributes significantly to the overall cell cycle delay. While elongation rates are correlated with growth rates, both properties appear to be differentially influenced by nutrient status. This slowdown in replication progression is not associated with increased mutagenesis or upregulation of the DNA damage responses. We conclude that the growth conditions not only dictate the commitment to replication but also the rates of genome duplication. Such regulation appears to be distinct from stress-induced replication slowdown and likely serves as an adaptive mechanism to cope with fluctuations in nutrient availability in the environment.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

The variable loops of the antibody complementarity-determining region (CDR) are particularly crucial for immune responses and therapeutic applications due to their effective target recognition capabilities. Accurate structure prediction of these antibody loops is essential for the efficient in silico design of target-binding antibodies for therapeutic or industrial use. However, predicting antibody loop structures is challenging due to the lack of evolutionary information from related proteins. Thus, a successful ab initio structure prediction method, which operates without structural templates or related sequences, is crucial for the effective design of antibody loop-mediated interactions. This study demonstrates that highly accurate antibody loop structure prediction enables the effective zero-shot design of target-binding antibody loops. The performance of loop design has been shown to depend on the accuracy of ab initio loop structure prediction, as tested with two versions of our design model. The high affinity, diversity, novelty, and specificity of the antibody loops designed with these new methods were validated experimentally on four target proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Many flagellated species move on agar using a form of collective motility termed swarming. Swarming has been thought to require flagellar propulsion. Here, we report the rapid migration of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica on agar surfaces in the absence of active propulsion by flagella. While immotile in liquid, filament-less and rotation-defective mutants of Salmonella LT2 and E. coli migrate on surfaces at rates comparable to wild-type. In contrast to the ""sliding"" motility reported in many species, the surface migration here does not require but is instead inhibited by surfactant. It is thus a novel form of surface movement that we call ""surfing."" Surfing cells acidify the plates, and surfing is found to depend on the presence of fermentable sugar. We propose a model in which fermentation at the colony front produces osmolytes that draw water from the agar to generate a moving bulge at the margin of the expanding colony.

Significance StatementBacteria move on surfaces using a variety of mechanisms, with important implications for their growth and survival in both the clinical setting (such as on the surface of medical devices) and in the wild. Surface motility in the medically important model species S. enterica and E. coli has been extensively studied and is thought to require flagellar propulsion. Here, we show surface expansion in these species even in the absence of propulsion by the flagella. Instead, movement is tied to fermentation and surface tension: As cells ferment sugars, they create local osmolarity gradients, which generate a wave of fluid on which the cells ""surf.""","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics. Extreme publishing authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most Physics authors with extreme publishing behavior had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of authors with extreme publishing behavior in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with >=5 full articles. Extreme publishing behavior has become worryingly common across scientific fields with rapidly increasing rates in some countries and settings and may herald a rapid depreciation of authorship standards.","10.1007/s11192-024-05117-w","biorxiv",1724623653947

Here, we show that HMGB1 rescues H1's inhibition of nucleosomal DNA accessibility without displacing H1. HMGB1 also increases the dynamics of condensed, H1-bound chromatin. Cryo-EM shows that HMGB1 binds at internal locations on a nucleosome and locally distorts the DNA. These sites, which are away from the binding site of H1, explain how HMGB1 and H1 co-occupy a nucleosome. Our findings lead to a model where HMGB1 counteracts the activity of H1 by distorting nucleosomal DNA and by contacting the H1 C-terminal tail. Compared to direct competition, nucleosome co-occupancy by HMGB1 and H1 allows a greater diversity of dynamic chromatin states and may be generalizable to other chromatin regulators.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

The Caribbean harbors a high number of threatened, endangered, and critically endangered coral species compared to reefs of the larger Indo-Pacific. The reef corals of the Caribbean are also long diverged from their Pacific counterparts and may have evolved different survival strategies. Most genomic resources have been developed for Pacific coral species which may impede our ability to study the changes in genetic composition of Caribbean reef communities in response to global change. To help fill the gap in genomic resources, we used PacBio HiFi sequencing to generate the first genome assemblies for three Caribbean, reef-building corals, Colpophyllia natans, Dendrogyra cylindrus, and Siderastrea siderea. We also explore the genomic novelties that shape scleractinian genomes. Notably, we find abundant gene duplications of all classes (e.g., tandem and segmental), especially in S. siderea. This species has one of the largest genomes of any scleractinian coral (822Mb) which seems to be driven by repetitive content and gene family expansion and diversification. As the genome size of S. siderea was double the size expected of stony corals, we also evaluated the possibility of an ancient whole genome duplication using Ks tests and found no evidence of such an event in the species. By presenting these genome assemblies, we hope to develop a better understanding of coral evolution as a whole and to enable researchers to further investigate the population genetics and diversity of these three species.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

We previously proposed that these NTD-targeting infection-enhancing antibodies (NIEAs) cross-link neighboring spike proteins via their NTDs, and that this results in a decoupling between the NTD and receptor binding domain (RBD), facilitating the ""RBD down"" to ""up"" transition.

These sensors are essential for bioengineering (e.g. in growth-coupled designs) but creating them is often a time-consuming and low-throughput process that can potentially be streamlined by in silico analysis. Here, we present the systematic workflow of designing, implementing, and testing versatile Escherichia coli metabolic sensor strains. Glyoxylate, a key metabolite in (synthetic) CO2 fixation and carbon-conserving pathways, served as the test molecule. Through iterative screening of a compact metabolic model, we identified non-trivial growth-coupled designs that resulted in six metabolic sensors with a wide sensitivity range for glyoxylate, spanning three orders of magnitude in detected concentrations. We further adapted these E. coli strains for sensing glycolate and demonstrated their utility in both pathway engineering (testing a key metabolic module via glyoxylate) and applications in environmental monitoring (quantifying glycolate produced by photosynthetic microalgae). The versatility and ease of implementation of this workflow make it suitable for designing and building multiple metabolic sensors for diverse biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). To define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in metabolic reprograming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of A{beta}. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased levels of A{beta}; plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism, neuroinflammation and the ability of the cells to take up A{beta}; such that reduced insulin signaling in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. Together these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Here, we aggregate structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 38,696 healthy controls (HC) and 1,256 psychosis-related conditions, including first-degree relatives of schizophrenia (SCZ) and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) patients (n = 160), individuals who had psychotic experiences (n = 157), patients who experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP, n = 352), and individuals with chronic SCZ or SAD (n = 587). Using a normative modeling approach, we generated centile scores for cortical gray matter (GM) phenotypes, identifying deviations in regional volumes below the expected trajectory for all conditions, with a greater impact on the clinically diagnosed ones, FEP and chronic. Additionally, we mapped 46 neurobiological features from healthy individuals (including neurotransmitters, cell types, layer thickness, microstructure, cortical expansion, and metabolism) to these abnormal centiles using a multivariate approach. Results revealed that neurobiological features were highly co-localized with centile deviations, where metabolism (e.g., cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRGlu) and cerebral blood flow (CBF)) and neurotransmitter concentrations (e.g., serotonin (5-HT) and acetylcholine (4{beta}2) receptors) showed the most consistent spatial overlap with abnormal GM trajectories. Taken together these findings shed light on the vulnerability factors that may underlie atypical brain maturation during different stages of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653947

Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating.

Genomic sequencing of influenza strains is important to understand the evolution of the influenza strains and also to select the appropriate influenza vaccines to be used in the different influenza seasons in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we sought to understand the molecular epidemiology of the influenza viruses in the Western Province of Sri Lanka, including mutational analysis to investigate the evolutionary dynamics. Methodology: A total of 349 individuals presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms were enrolled in this study from November 2022 to May 2024. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens were collected and screened using quantitative PCR to detect Influenza A, Influenza B, and SARS-CoV-2. Subtyping and genomic sequencing was carried out on influenza A strains using Oxford Nanopore Technology. Results: Influenza A was detected in 49 (14 %) patients, influenza B in 20 (5.7%) and SARS-CoV-2 in 41 (11.7%). Co-infections were observed in five participants. The phylogenetic analysis assigned the H1N1 HA gene sequences within the 6B.1A.5a.2a clade. The HA gene of the H1N1 sequences in 2023 were assigned as belonging to the subclades C.1, C.1.2, and C.1.8, while the 2024 sequences were assigned to subclades C.1.8 and C.1.9. The H3N2 sequences from 2023 were assigned to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.1b clade and subclade G.1.1.2, while the 2024 sequences were assigned to the 3C.2a1b.2a.2a.3a.1 clade and subclade J.2. The K54Q, A186T, Q189E, E224A, R259K, K308R, I418V, and X215A amino acid substitutions were seen in the H1N1 in the 2023 and 2024 sequences. The 2024 H1N1 sequences additionally exhibited further substitutions, such as V47I, I96T, T120A, A139D, G339X, K156X, and T278S. Conclusion: In this first study using genomic sequencing to characterize the influenza A strains in Sri Lanka, which showed different influenza A viruses circulating in an 18-month period. As the Sri Lankan strains also had certain mutations of unknown significance, it would be important to continue detailed surveillance of the influenza strains in Sri Lanka to choose the most suitable vaccines for the population and the timing of vaccine administration.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653947

However, the epigenome regulation of the centromere and its impact on centromere function remain largely elusive. Here in the model plant Arabidopsis, we show that CCR4, the catalytic subunit of the RNA deadenylation complex CCR4-NOT, is essential for maintenance of the centromere epigenome and chromosome integrity. We demonstrate that CCR4 is involved in shortening of the poly(A) tails of transcripts originated from centromeric transposons and repeats, thereby promoting the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The CCR4-dependent siRNAs guide non-CG DNA methylation at centromere repeats, and CCR4 cooperates with canonical DNA methylation pathways to enhance centromeric H3K9 methylation and ensure mitotic chromosome stability. Our study illustrates the crucial role of RNA quality control in RNA interference and reveals the elaborate mechanism that safeguards plant centromeres through epigenomic regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

We prompted 4 LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, Stanford Medicine Secure GPT (GPT-4.0)) with a set of 38 prompts consisting of explicit questions and synthetic clinical notes created by medically trained reviewers and LGBTQIA+ health experts. The prompts explored clinical situations across two axes: (i) situations where historical bias has been observed vs. not observed, and (ii) situations where LGBTQIA+ identity is relevant to clinical care vs. not relevant. Medically trained reviewers evaluated LLM responses for appropriateness (safety, privacy, hallucination/accuracy, and bias) and clinical utility. We find that all 4 LLMs evaluated generated inappropriate responses to our prompt set. LLM performance is strongly hampered by learned anti-LGBTQIA+ bias and over-reliance on the mentioned conditions in prompts. Given these results, future work should focus on tailoring output formats according to stated use cases, decreasing sycophancy and reliance on extraneous information in the prompt, and improving accuracy and decreasing bias for LGBTQIA+ patients and care providers.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653947

By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1-3% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithm's widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations. Our tests validated ActSort's performance across different experimental conditions and datasets from multiple animals.

Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions.

Using Swedish data on age-specific reported incidence, vaccination uptake, and contact structures, along with age-specific estimates on the vaccine efficacies and under-reporting from the literature, we fit a Bayesian SEIR epidemic model with time-varying community contact rate {beta}(t) for COVID-19 incidence. By adding age-specific infection fatality rates, we obtain an estimate of about 5,540 (95% PI: 5,390-5,690) for the number of case fatalities from the fitted model. This estimate aligns closely with the reported 5,430 case fatalities during the same period. We then use the estimated contact rate {beta}(t) in a counterfactual analysis where the population is unvaccinated, leading to more infections and fatalities. The counterfactual analysis result in a severe epidemic outbreak during the early autumn of 2021, resulting in about 52,600 (49,900-55,500) number of case fatalities. Consequently, the number of lives saved by the vaccination program is estimated to be about 47,100 (44,500-49,800), out of which 6,460 are directly saved and 40,600 are indirectly saved, mainly by drastically reducing the severe outbreak in the early autumn of 2021, which would have occurred without vaccination and unchanged community contact rate. Our mathematical model is used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on lives saved in Sweden during 2021, but the same methodology can be applied to other countries. The counterfactual analysis offers insights into an alternative trajectory of the pandemic without vaccination. By incorporating estimated vaccination-related parameters, age-specific infection fatality ratio and under-reporting, our model estimates the number of case fatalities avoided.

Here we describe activity of the descending neuron DNp03 in Drosophila, which receives direct input from looming-sensitive visual interneurons and projects to wing motor areas within the ventral nerve cord. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from this neuron during head-fixed flight confirm that DNp03 is responsive to looming stimuli on the side ipsilateral to its dendrites. In addition, activity of this neuron is state-dependent as looming stimuli only elicit spikes during flight and not rest. The behavior in response to the looming stimulus is variable, which allowed us to study how activity of DNp03 relates to the execution of a saccade. Our analysis revealed that sustained activity in DNp03, persisting even after the visual stimulus ended, was the strongest predictor of saccade execution, therefore reflecting the behavioral decision of the fly to respond to the stimulus.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Despite the added viscous load from the relatively large Janus NP probe, our approach provides accurate torque measurements of single V-ATPase. This study underscores the advantages of Janus NPs over conventional probes, establishing them as powerful tools for single-molecule analysis of rotary molecular motors.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Vagal TRPV1+ nociceptive sensory neurons, which innervate the airways, are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents. However, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Despite its importance, conducting manual experiments with individual fruit flies can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for studies of individual fly behaviors. Such studies often involve cumbersome preparatory steps, such as manually tethering a fly and then positioning it within an experimental setup1,2. These procedures commonly require the fly to be anesthetized, and, before behavioral assessments begin, the fly must recover from anesthesia. Hence, the introduction of automated phenotyping and behavioral assays would expedite important aspects of fly research, by minimizing manual handling of flies and decreasing the net time needed for experiments. Here, we introduce FlyMAX (Fly Manipulation and Autonomous eXperimentation), an autonomous robotic system for manipulating adult flies without use of anesthesia. FlyMAX collects individual flies from a standard vial, analyzes them with computer vision, and achieves a throughput of >1,000 flies per day for high-throughput inspection and characterization assays. Robotic handling had no detectable adverse effects on fly longevity or our assessments of fly health. Moreover, the behavioral performance of flies, especially of males, was better and less variable than of flies handled manually. Our system employs deep learning-based machine vision for real-time assessments of picking quality and fly phenotypes. This enables fully pipelined, autonomous experimentation for behavioral assays with individual flies in controlled environments, which was previously infeasible. Overall, FlyMAX constitutes a promising technology to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research with flies and other insects in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Exporting this measure to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and UK Biobank neuroimaging datasets revealed that faster DunedinPACNI predicted participants' cognitive impairment, accelerated brain atrophy, and conversion to diagnosed dementia. Underscoring close links between longitudinal aging of the body and brain, faster DunedinPACNI also predicted physical frailty, poor health, future chronic diseases, and mortality in older adults. Furthermore, DunedinPACNI followed the expected socioeconomic health gradient. When compared to brain age gap, an existing MRI aging biomarker, DunedinPACNI was similarly or more strongly related to clinical outcomes. DunedinPACNI is a 'next generation' MRI measure that will be made publicly available to the research community to help accelerate aging research and evaluate the effectiveness of dementia prevention and anti-aging strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Allosteric sites provide several theoretical advantages, including the ability to modulate natural ligand function, and there is a need for better ways to study how ligands bind and interact with diVerent GPCR binding sites. We have developed an approach to study multiple ligands binding to the same receptor based on sequential resonance energy transfer between two fluorescent ligands bound simultaneously to a GPCR.

Such studies face the central difficulty of distinguishing possible causal influences, in particular genetic and non-genetic ones. When confounding between possible influences is not rigorously addressed, it invites over- and misinterpretation of data. We illustrate the breadth of this problem through a discussion of the literature and a reanalysis of two examples. Clark (2023) suggested that patterns of similarity in social status between relatives indicate that social status is largely determined by one's DNA. We show that the paper's conclusions are based on the conflation of genetic and non-genetic transmission, such as wealth, within families. Song & Zhang (2024) posited that genetic variants underlying bisexual behavior are maintained in the population because they also affect risk-taking behavior, thereby conferring an evolutionary fitness advantage through increased sexual promiscuity. In this case, too, we show that possible explanations cannot be distinguished, but only one is chosen and presented as a conclusion. We discuss how issues of confounding apply more broadly to studies that claim to establish genetic underpinnings to human behavior and societal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Here, we conducted a multilevel longitudinal study of monkey adolescent neurocognitive development. The developmental trajectory of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex accounted remarkably well for working memory improvements. While complex aspects of activity changed progressively during adolescence, such as the rotation of stimulus representation in multidimensional neuronal space, which has been implicated in cognitive flexibility, even simpler attributes, such as the baseline firing rate in the period preceding a stimulus appearance had predictive power over behavior. Unexpectedly, decreases in brain volume and thickness, which are widely thought to underlie cognitive changes in humans 5 did not predict well the trajectory of neural activity or cognitive performance changes. Whole brain cortical volume in particular, exhibited an increase and reached a local maximum in late adolescence, at a time of rapid behavioral improvement. Maturation of long-distance white matter tracts linking the frontal lobe with areas of the association cortex and subcortical regions best predicted changes in neuronal activity and behavior. Our results provide evidence that optimization of neural activity depending on widely distributed circuitry effects cognitive development in adolescence.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

To exert these functions, efficient binding of IgG to gut bacterial antigens and engagement of Fc and complement dependent effector functions in offspring was required. These discoveries reveal a novel mechanism wherein maternal IgG engages the offspring immune system to calibrate responses to gut microbes. This mode of maternal immune instruction may provide adaptability to developmental shifts in microbiota necessary for establishing host-microbiota mutualism and limiting susceptibility to inflammatory disease.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Machine learning can expedite this discovery process. Although machine learning techniques for predicting general compound inhibition are available, we are not aware of any that accurately forecast the inhibitory effect of a compound on a specific protein complex, utilizing inputs from both the compound and the protein complex. We present the first targeted machine learning based predictor of small molecule based inhibition of protein complexes. Our proposed graph neural network integrates the structure of a protein complex, its binding site or interface features and a compound's SMILES representation to predict the potential of the given compound to inhibit the interaction between proteins in the given complex in a targeted manner.

However, approaches typically used to assess this signaling mechanism by directly measuring G-protein activity, like optical biosensors, suffer from limitations. On one hand, many of these biosensors require expression of exogenous GPCRs and/or G-proteins, compromising readout fidelity. On the other hand, biosensors that measure endogenous signaling may still interfere with the signaling process under investigation or suffer from having a small dynamic range of detection, hindering broad applicability. Here, we developed an optical biosensor that detects the endogenous G-protein active species Gi-GTP upon stimulation of endogenous GPCRs more robustly than current state-of-the-art sensors for the same purpose. Its design is based on the principle of bystander Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) and leverages the Gi-binding protein named GINIP as a high affinity and specific detector module of the GTP-bound conformation of Gi. We optimized this design to prevent interference with Gi-dependent signaling (cAMP inhibition) and to enable implementation in different experimental systems with endogenous GPCRs, including neurotransmitter receptors in primary astroglial cells or opioid receptors in cell lines, which revealed opioid neuropeptide-mediated activation profiles different from those observed with other biosensors involving exogenous GPCRs and G-proteins. Overall, we introduce a biosensor that directly and sensitively detects endogenous activation of G-proteins by GPCRs across different experimental settings without interfering with the subsequent propagation of signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

This is variously interpreted as speed/accuracy, fast/slow, or impulsivity/deliberateness tradeoffs according to different models of behaviour. Regardless, it is generally assumed that decision latency reflects the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural strategy and cognitive investment. However, such investigations have been difficult in mice which are consistently impulsive. Here, we show that manipulating cost, using a novel floating-platform paradigm, overcomes the natural impulsivity of mice, more closely matching human behaviour. Furthermore, this approach allowed us simultaneously to measure the flow of activity from medial to lateral frontal cortex (MFC to LFC) and record sequences of single neuron activity with 2-photon imaging. Surprisingly, MFC display a different mode of operation, with high vulnerability to optical inhibition compared to LFC. Furthermore, the balance in choice coding at the beginning of sequences in MFC correlated with trial history and behavioural strategy. We found that for optimal performance, slow sequences in MFC showed declining numbers of active neurons whereas the opposite was true in LFC. Our results suggest that while LFC acts as an integrative motor threshold, MFC plays a larger cognitive role in the selection and timing of decisions than previously thought. Our study offers a methodological and mechanistic framework in mouse frontal cortex to understand the neural basis of voluntary decision making.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Gain-of-function of voltage-gated K+ channels expressed in fibroblast-lineage blastema cells promotes excessive fin outgrowth, leading to a long-finned phenotype. Similarly, inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin during regeneration causes dramatic fin overgrowth. However, Ca2+ fluxes and their potential origins from dynamic membrane voltages have not been explored or linked to fin size restoration. We used fibroblast-lineage GCaMP imaging of regenerating adult fins to identify dynamic and heterogeneous Ca2+ transients in distal blastema cells. Membrane depolarization of isolated regenerating fin fibroblasts triggered Ca2+ spikes dependent on voltage-gated Ca2+ channel activity. Single cell transcriptomics identified the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels cacna1c (L-type channel), cacna1ba (N-type), and cacna1g (T-type) as candidate mediators of fibroblast-lineage Ca2+ signaling. Small molecule inhibition revealed L- and/or N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels act during regenerative outgrowth to restore fins to their original scale. Strikingly, cacna1g homozygous mutant zebrafish regenerated extraordinarily long fins due to prolonged outgrowth. The regenerated fins far exceeded their original length but with otherwise normal ray skeletons. Therefore, cacna1g mutants uniquely provide a genetic loss-of-function long-finned model that decouples developmental and regenerative fin outgrowth. Live GCaMP imaging of regenerating fins showed T-type Cacna1g channels enable Ca2+ dynamics in distal fibroblast-lineage blastemal mesenchyme during the outgrowth phase.

The selected line (SL) flies exhibited enhanced BL-tolerance, and also increased body weight and lipid accumulation. Interestingly, we found elongated midgut in the SL flies, and increased microbiota, which was dominated by Acetobacter persici. The BL-tolerance and the lipid accumulation were dependent on the increment of gut microbiota. Genomic analysis identified mutations in the Hippo signaling pathway linked to midgut elongation, while transcriptome analysis showed downregulation of Tachykinin (Tk), a key suppressor of intestinal lipogenesis. Genetically induced lipid accumulation through manipulation of Tk or related lipogenic genes was sufficient to confer BL-tolerance. Moreover, our findings indicate that parental BL irradiation, along with accumulated mutations from laboratory selection, played a crucial role in midgut elongation and increased bacterial abundance. These findings reveal evolutionary responses to excessive BL exposure that shape host traits to maximize the benefits provided by gut microbiota.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Fructose also stimulates insulin secretion, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the contribution of phospholipase C (PLC) signaling and fructose metabolism to fructose-stimulated insulin secretion (FSIS) using MIN6-K8 clonal {beta}-cells and mouse islets. Fructose-induced PLC activation, assessed by inositol 1-phosphate accumulation, was reduced in fructose-unresponsive {beta}-cell models, such as diabetic mouse islets and KATP channel-deficient {beta}-cells, suggesting that {beta}-cell fructose responsiveness is primarily determined by PLC signaling. Although FSIS was dependent on KATP channels and Ca2+ influx, the ATP/ADP ratio was unexpectedly lowered by fructose, and suppression of intracellular fructose metabolism hardly affected FSIS. Metabolic flux analysis revealed that the accumulation of fructose 1-phosphate (F1P) suppressed pyruvate kinase (PK) activity, contributing to ATP depletion. Strikingly, a small-molecule PK activator, TEPP-46, antagonized F1P-mediated PK suppression, prevented the drop in the ATP/ADP ratio, and restored FSIS in MIN6-K8 cells, normal mouse islets, and fructose-unresponsive diabetic mouse islets. These findings revealed the metabolic effects of fructose in {beta}-cells and identified PK as a key regulator linking {beta}-cell fructose metabolism and FSIS, thereby providing new insights into the mechanisms of insulin secretion and potential therapeutic targets for fructose-associated metabolic diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Their multifaceted roles in health and disease have garnered significant attention in the context of neurodegeneration. In recent years, single-cell transcriptomic techniques have provided unprecedented insights into microglial heterogeneity, revealing distinct subpopulations and gene expression patterns associated with neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. Here, the transcriptomic landscape of microglia has been dissected by leveraging human single-nuclei RNA sequencing datasets of neurodegenerative conditions, encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, aging, and Parkinson's disease. Results have led to the identification of distinct cell subpopulations, representative of the functional heterogeneity of the brain microglia. Moreover, distinct gene signatures and regulatory networks linked to inflammation and neurodegeneration have been identified. Overall, the study provides an improved portrait of microglia in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, and it holds promise for developing a more targeted research aimed at modulating microglial function to mitigate disease progression and foster neuroprotection.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

However, molecular mechanisms controlling neutrophil development remain largely unknown. Here we systematically analysed changes in gene expression and chromatin landscape across stages of neutrophil differentiation, to construct a network of transcription factors, predicted to control neutrophil development and acquisition of functions. Zinc finger protein 263 (Zfp263) emerged at the apex of this network. Neutrophil maturation ex vivo and in vivo was blocked in cells lacking Zfp263 and accelerated if its levels were induced. Mechanistically, Zfp263 acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of the ERK1/2 pathway, that supports the proliferative capacity of neutrophil progenitors and limits their differentiation into mature cells. Blocking ERK1/2 signalling in the Zfp263 deficient cells using chemical inhibitors, rescues neutrophil differentiation. Other targets of Zfp263 include genes involved in neutrophil migration, cytokine and chemokine expression, reactive oxygen species and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. Thus, our study outlines a framework for modulation of neutrophil development and/or function, aimed at neutrophil-mediated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

The RNA velocity framework utilizes both spliced and unspliced reads in sin- gle cell mRNA preparations to predict future cellular states and estimate transcriptional kinetics. However, current models assume either constant kinetic rates, rates equal for all genes, or rates completely independent of progression through differentiation. Consequently, current models for rate estimation are either underparametrised or overparametrised. Here we developed a new method (diffGEK) which overcomes this issue, and allows comparison of transcriptional rates across different biological conditions. diffGEK assumes that rates can vary over a trajectory, but are smooth functions of the differentiation process. Analysing Jak2 V617F mutant versus wild type mice for erythropoiesis, and Ezh2 KO versus wild type mice in myelopoiesis, revealed which genes show altered transcription, splicing or degradation rates between different conditions. Moreover, we observed that, for some genes, compensatory changes between different rates can result in comparable overall mRNA levels, thereby masking highly dynamic changes in gene expression kinetics in conventional expression analysis. Collectively, we report a robust pipeline for comparative expression analysis based on altered transcriptional kinetics to discover mechanistic differences missed by conventional approaches, with broad applicability across any biomedical research question where single cell expression data are available for both wild type and treatment/mutant conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653947

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (""genetic distance""). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Anti-defense proteins have diverse functional domains, sequences, and are typically small, creating a challenge to detect anti-defense homologs across the prokaryotic genomes. To date, no tools comprehensively annotate anti-defense proteins within a desired genome or MGE. Here, we developed ""AntiDefenseFinder"" - a free open-source tool and web service that detects 156 anti-defense systems (of one or more proteins) in any genomic sequence. Using this dataset, we identified 47,981 anti-defense systems distributed across prokaryotes, phage, and MGEs. We found that some genes co-localize in ""anti-defense islands"", including E. coli T4 and Lambda phages, although many are standalone. Out of the 112 systems detected in bacteria, 100 systems localize only or preferentially in prophages, plasmids, phage satellites, integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements. However, over 80% of anti-Pycsar protein 1 (Apyc1) resides in non-mobile regions of bacteria. Evolutionary and functional analyses revealed that Apyc1 likely originated in bacteria to regulate cNMP signaling, but was co-opted multiple times by phages to overcome cNMP-utilizing defenses. With the AntiDefenseFinder tool, we hope to facilitate the identification of the full repertoire of anti-defense systems in MGEs, the discovery of new protein functions, and a deeper understanding of host-pathogen arms race.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

To evaluate LRS's additional diagnostic yield, we sequenced a rare disease cohort of 98 samples, including 41 probands and some family members, using nanopore sequencing, achieving per sample ~36x average coverage and 32 kilobase (kb) read N50 from a single flow cell.

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653947

Here, we use a meta-scoring approach to develop a metaPRS for T2D that incorporated genome-wide associations from both European and non-European genetic ancestries and T2D risk factors. We evaluated the performance of this metaPRS and benchmarked it against existing genome-wide PRS in 620,059 participants and 50,572 T2D cases amongst six diverse genetic ancestries from UK Biobank, INTERVAL, the All of Us Research Program, and the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort.

The metaPRS modestly improved T2D risk stratification of QDiabetes risk scores for 10-year risk prediction, particularly when prioritising individuals for blood tests of dysglycemia.

Here, we used 3D light-sheet imaging to analyze the location and Ca2+ activity of single lower case Greek beta-cells within the entire islet at >2 Hz. Network analysis indicates that the most highly synchronized lower case Greek beta-cells are located at the islet center and remain geographically stable between oscillations. In contrast, lower case Greek beta-cells that initiate the Ca2+ wave ('leaders') are located at the islet periphery and change their identity over time via rotations in the wave axis. Activators of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase were used to further test the influence of glycolysis on these lower case Greek beta-cell subpopulations. Glucokinase activation, which increased oscillation period, reinforced leader cells and stabilized the wave axis. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. The 3D islet lower case Greek beta-cell network, which did not respond to either treatment, is insensitive to changes in fuel metabolism. These findings emphasize the stochastic nature of Ca2+ oscillations and identify a role for glucokinase in spatially patterning 'leader' lower case Greek beta-cells.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

Auxin-dependent transcriptional changes are mediated by DNA-binding Auxin Response Factors (ARF), whose AuxRE DNA binding sites are well-known. The identification of the first AuxRE showed this to be part of a composite element with a second motif. Indeed, systematic analysis showed other DNA motifs to be enriched in auxin-regulated promoters. Neither the basis for this enrichment nor the mechanisms for the activity of composite AuxREs is known. Here, we systematically mined Arabidopsis promoters for composite AuxRE elements enriched in auxin-responsive genes. We identified many and show that their presence is a reliable predictor of auxin response. Through mutating these elements and their higher-order modules, we demonstrate function in promoter activity. Lastly, we identified transcription factors (TFs) that bind AuxRE-associated motifs, showed their involvement in auxin response, and discovered that several of these TFs directly bind ARF proteins. We propose that ARF-TF complexes specifically bind compound motifs in promoters, and act as a source of diversification in auxin-dependent gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping.

ResultsWe describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts.

When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfishs quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neurons anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

The delivery of conventional IgG antibody technologies targeting GD2 is limited clinically by its co-expression on nerves that contributes to toxicity presenting as severe neuropathic pain. To improve the tumor selectivity of current GD2-targeting approaches, a next-generation bispecific antibody targeting GD2 and B7-H3 (CD276) was generated.

MethodsDifferential expression of human B7-H3 (hB7-H3) was transduced into GD2+ B78 murine melanoma cells and confirmed by flow cytometry. We assessed the avidity and selectivity of our GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies (INV34-6, INV33-2, and INV36-6) towards GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 cells relative to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells using flow cytometry and competition binding assays, comparing results an anti-GD2 antibody (dinutuximab, DINU). The bispecific antibodies, DINU, and a non-targeted bispecific control (bsAb CTRL) were conjugated with deferoxamine for radiolabeling with Zr-89 (t1/2 = 78.4 h). Using positron emission tomography (PET) studies, we evaluated the in vivo avidity and selectivity of the GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific compared to bsAb CTRL and DINU using GD2+/hB7-H3+ and GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumor models.

ResultsFlow cytometry and competition binding assays showed that INV34-6 bound with high avidity to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells with high avidity but not GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells. In comparison, no selectivity between cell types was observed for DINU. PET in mice bearing the GD2+/hB7-H3- and GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 murine tumor showed similar biodistribution in normal tissues for [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6, [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL, and [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU. Importantly, [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 tumor uptake was selective to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 over GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumors, and substantially higher to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 than the non-targeted [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL control. [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU displayed similar uptake in both GD2+ tumor models, with uptake comparable to [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 in the GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 model.

ConclusionThe GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies successfully improved selectivity to cells expressing both antigens. This approach should address the severe toxicities associated with GD2-targeting therapies by reducing off-tumor GD2 binding in nerves. Continued improvements in bispecific antibody technologies will continue to transform the therapeutic biologics landscape.

Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined.

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors3,4 and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription5. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient6,7. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653948

Previous explanations of this phenomenon have posited negative interactions between donor-population alleles and the recipient populations genome or environment, or higher genetic load in the donor population. Here, we show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits--even around the same optimal trait values in the two populations and when the populations are demographically identical--generates selection against the minor-parent ancestry in a population formed via unequal admixture of the two populations. We calculate the rate at which minor-parent ancestry is purged under this mechanism, both in the early generations after admixture and in the long term, and we verify these calculations with whole-genome simulations. Because of its ubiquity, stabilizing selection offers a general mechanism for the deleterious effect of introgressed ancestry.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

AlphaFold2 predictions revealed that RPA and TPP1 interact with telomerase at distinct binding sites. Using separation- of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPAs ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies.

However, the specific epigenetic regulators and the processes they control to drive cancer phenotypes are poorly understood. Here, we employed a novel, scalable and high-throughput in vivo method to perform iterative functional screens of over 250 epigenetic regulatory genes within autochthonous oncogenic KRAS-driven lung tumors. We identified multiple novel epigenetic tumor suppressor and tumor dependency genes. We show that a specific HBO1 complex and the MLL1 complex are among the most impactful tumor suppressive epigenetic regulators in lung. The histone modifications generated by the HBO1 complex are frequently absent or reduced in human lung adenocarcinomas. The HBO1 and MLL1 complexes regulate chromatin accessibility of shared genomic regions, lineage fidelity and the expression of canonical tumor suppressor genes. The HBO1 and MLL1 complexes are epistatic during lung tumorigenesis, and their functional correlation is conserved in human cancer cell lines. Together, these results demonstrate the value of quantitative methods to generate a phenotypic roadmap of epigenetic regulatory genes in tumorigenesis in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

Here we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of a human AGO-guide complex bound to a fully paired target, revealing structural rearrangements that enable this conformation. Critically, the N domain of AGO rotates to allow the RNA full access to the central channel and forms contacts that license rapid slicing. Moreover, a conserved loop in the PIWI domain secures the RNA near the active site to enhance slicing rate and specificity. These results explain how AGO accommodates targets possessing the pairing specificity typically observed in biological and clinical slicing substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724623653948

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653948

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724623653949
