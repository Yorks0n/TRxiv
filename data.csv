While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, much less is known about the efficacy of nAbs in preventing the acquisition of infection, especially in the context of natural immunity and against SARS-CoV-2 immune-escape variants. In this study, we conducted mediation analysis to assess serum nAbs induced by prior SARS-CoV-2 infections as potential correlates of protection (CoPs) against Delta and Omicron BA.1/2 wave infections, in rural and urban household cohorts in South Africa. We find that, in the Delta wave, anti-D614G nAbs mediate 37% (95%CI 34% - 40%) of the total protection against infection conferred by prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and that protection decreases with immunity waning. In contrast, anti-Omicron BA.1 nAbs mediate 11% (95%CI 9 - 12%) of the total protection against Omicron BA.1/2 wave infections, due to Omicrons neutralization escape. These findings underscore that CoPs mediated through nAbs are variant-specific, and that boosting of nAbs against circulating variants might restore or confer immune protection lost due to nAb waning and/or immune escape. However, the majority of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 conferred by natural infection cannot be fully explained by serum nAbs alone. Measuring these and other immune markers including T-cell responses, both in the serum and in other compartments such as the nasal mucosa, may be required to comprehensively understand and predict immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

The etiology of PD remains elusive, and currently available treatments do not halt disease progression.

In this study, conducted within a national health provider, we examined the impact of vaccination and medication purchase on PD occurrence and severity, using an innovative machine learning algorithm to track disease progression.

Our findings reveal a significant reduction in PD occurrence following anti-tetanus vaccination, with a time-dependent association between the elapsed time since vaccination and both the rate and progression of PD. These results are supported by evidence that antimicrobial treatments significantly alter disease severity, suggesting the actual involvement of Clostridium Tetani in PD pathology.

Thus, tetanus vaccination and C. tetani eradication could be promising strategies for preventing PD and slowing its progression, pending controlled clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

The recent development of optogenetic tools for controlling RTKs and their downstream signaling pathways suggested these responses may be amenable to engineering-based control for sculpting tissue shape and function. Here, we report that a light-controlled EGF receptor (OptoEGFR) can be deployed in epithelial cell lines for precise, programmable control of long-range tissue movements. We show that in OptoEGFR-expressing tissues, light can drive millimeter-scale cell rearrangements to densify interior regions or produce rapid outgrowth at tissue edges. Light-controlled tissue movements are driven primarily by PI 3-kinase signaling, rather than diffusible signals, tissue contractility, or ERK kinase signaling as seen in other RTK-driven migration contexts. Our study suggests that synthetic, light-controlled RTKs could serve as a powerful platform for controlling cell positions and densities for diverse applications including wound healing and tissue morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Benchmarking of the available methods has revealed general tradeoffs between accuracy and scalability, but performance in downstream applications has not always been easily predictable from general performance measures, suggesting that specific features of the ARG may be important for specific downstream applications of estimated ARGs. To exemplify this point, we benchmark ARG estimation methods with respect to a specific set of methods for estimating the historical time course of a population-mean polygenic score (PGS) using the marginal coalescent trees encoded by the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Here we examine the performance in simulation of six ARG estimation methods: ARGweaver, RENT+, Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust, and SINGER, using their estimated coalescent trees and examining bias, mean squared error (MSE), confidence interval coverage, and Type I and II error rates of the downstream methods. Although it does not scale to the sample sizes attainable by other new methods, SINGER produced the most accurate estimated PGS histories in many instances, even when Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, and ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust used samples ten times as large as those used by SINGER. In general, the best choice of method depends on the number of samples available and the historical time period of interest. In particular, the unprecedented sample sizes allowed by Relate, tsinfer+tsdate, and ARG-Needle/ASMC-clust are of greatest importance when the recent past is of interest---further back in time, most of the tree has coalesced, and differences in contemporary sample size are less salient.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

F456L increased resistance to neutralization by human sera, including those after JN.1 breakthrough infections, and by RBD class-1 monoclonal antibodies, significantly altering JN.1 antigenicity. R346T enhanced ACE2-binding affinity, without a discernible effect on serum neutralization. Individually, R346T and T572I modestly enhanced infectivity of each pseudovirus. Importantly, expanding sublineages such as KP.2 containing R346T, F456L, and V1104L, showed similar neutralization resistance as JN.1 with R346T and F456L, suggesting V1104L does not appreciably affect antibody evasion.

The Episodic Disability Framework (EDF), derived from perspectives of adults living with HIV, characterizes the multidimensional and episodic nature of health-related challenges (disability) experienced by an individual. Our aim was to determine the applicability of the Episodic Disability Framework to conceptualize the health-related challenges experienced among adults living with Long COVID.

MethodsWe conducted a community-engaged qualitative descriptive study involving online semi-structured interviews. We recruited adults who self-identified as living with Long COVID via collaborator community organizations in Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom, and United States. We purposively recruited for diversity in age, gender identity, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and time since initial COVID-19 infection. We used a semi-structured interview guide informed by the EDF to explore experiences of disability living with Long COVID, specifically health-related challenges and how challenges were experienced over time. We conducted a group-based content analysis.

ResultsOf the 40 participants, the median age was 39 years; and the majority were white 73%), women (63%), living with Long COVID for [&ge;]1 year (83%). Consistent with the Episodic Disability Framework, disability was described as multidimensional and episodic, characterized by unpredictable periods of health and illness. Experiences of disability were consistent with the three main components of the Framework: A) dimensions of disability (physical, cognitive, mental-emotional health challenges, difficulties with day-to-day activities, challenges to social inclusion, uncertainty); B) contextual factors, extrinsic (social support; accessibility of environment and health services; stigma and epistemic injustice) and intrinsic (living strategies; personal attributes) that exacerbate or alleviate dimensions of disability; and C) triggers that initiate episodes of disability.

ConclusionsThe Episodic Disability Framework provides a way to conceptualize disability the multidimensional and episodic nature of disability experienced by adults living with Long COVID. The Framework provides guidance for future measurement of disability, and health and rehabilitation approaches to enhance practice, research, and policy in Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

Our study explores the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, a classic model system in biology and a species adept at microscale interaction, as a biological platform for micro-robotics. Initially, we focus on remotely directing the walking paths of fruit flies in an experimental arena. We accomplish this through two distinct approaches: harnessing the fruit flies opto-motor response and optogenetic modulation of its olfactory system. These techniques facilitate reliable and repeated guidance of flies between arbitrary spatial locations. We guide flies along predetermined trajectories, enabling them to scribe patterns resembling textual characters through their locomotion. We enhance olfactory-guided navigation through additional optogenetic activation of positive valence mushroom body output neurons. We extend this control to collective behaviors in shared spaces and navigation through constrained maze-like environments. We further use our guidance technique to enable flies to carry a load across designated points in space, establishing the upper bound on their weight carrying capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that visual guidance can facilitate novel interactions between flies and objects, showing that flies can consistently relocate a small spherical object over significant distances. Beyond expanding tools available for micro-robotics, these novel behavioral contexts can provide insights into the neurological basis of behavior in fruit flies.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

To date (24 May 2024), we have tested 18 retail milk samples from five Canadian provinces (NL, NB, QC, MB, and AB) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early warning system which will enable rapid responses necessary to contain an outbreak should any samples test positive.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

The integration of ion mobility separation into DIA analysis, such as the diaPASEF technology available on Bruker's timsTOF platform, further improves the quantification accuracy and protein depth achievable using DIA. We introduce diaTracer, a new spectrum-centric computational tool optimized for diaPASEF data. diaTracer performs three-dimensional (m/z, retention time, ion mobility) peak tracing and feature detection to generate precursor-resolved ""pseudo-MS/MS"" spectra, facilitating direct (""spectral-library free"") peptide identification and quantification from diaPASEF data. diaTracer is available as a stand-alone tool and is fully integrated into the widely used FragPipe computational platform. We demonstrate the performance of diaTracer and FragPipe using diaPASEF data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples, data from phosphoproteomics and HLA immunopeptidomics experiments, and low-input data from a spatial proteomics study. We also show that diaTracer enables unrestricted identification of post-translational modifications from diaPASEF data using open/mass offset searches.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

These libraries are often kept in plasmids that are amplified in E. coli to generate sufficient material for an experiment. Library uniformity is critical for ensuring that every element in the library is tested similarly, and is thought to be influenced by the culture approach used during library amplification. We tested five commonly used culturing methods for their ability to uniformly amplify plasmid libraries: liquid, semisolid agar, cell spreader-spread plates with high or low colony density, and bead-spread plates. Each approach was evaluated with two library types: a random 80-mer library, representing high complexity low coverage of similar sequence lengths, and a human TF ORF library, representing low complexity high coverage of diverse sequence lengths. We found that no method was better than liquid culture, which produced relatively uniform libraries regardless of library type. However, when libraries were transformed with high coverage, culturing method had minimal impact on uniformity or amplification bias. Plating libraries was the worst approach by almost every measure for both library types, and, counter-intuitively, produced the strongest biases against long sequence representation. Semisolid agar amplified most elements of the library uniformly but also included outliers with orders of magnitude higher abundance. For amplifying DNA libraries, liquid culture, the simplest method, appears to be best.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

A recently published computational approach, IBDGem, analyzes sequencing reads, including from low-coverage samples, in order to arrive at likelihood ratios for tests of identity. Here, we show that likelihood ratios produced by IBDGem test a null hypothesis different from the traditional one used in a forensic genetics context. In particular, rather than testing the hypothesis that the sample comes from a person unrelated to the person of interest, IBDGem tests the hypothesis that the sample comes from an individual who is included in the reference sample used to run the method. This null hypothesis is not generally of forensic interest, because the defense hypothesis is not that the evidence comes from an individual included in a reference panel. Further, it does not take into account genetic variation outside the reference panel, and as a result, the computed likelihood ratios can be much larger than likelihood ratios computed for the standard forensic null hypothesis, often by many orders of magnitude, thus potentially creating an impression of stronger evidence for identity than is warranted. We lay out this result and illustrate it with examples, giving suggestions for directions that might lead to likelihood ratios that have the traditional interpretation.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Increasingly, large genome-sequenced cohorts are improving our ability to discover new diagnoses in the non-coding genome. Here, we identify the non-coding RNA RNU4-2 as a novel syndromic NDD gene. RNU4-2 encodes the U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), which is a critical component of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex of the major spliceosome2. We identify an 18 bp region of RNU4-2 mapping to two structural elements in the U4/U6 snRNA duplex (the T-loop and Stem III) that is severely depleted of variation in the general population, but in which we identify heterozygous variants in 119 individuals with NDD. The vast majority of individuals (77.3%) have the same highly recurrent single base-pair insertion (n.64_65insT). We estimate that variants in this region explain 0.41% of individuals with NDD. We demonstrate that RNU4-2 is highly expressed in the developing human brain, in contrast to its contiguous counterpart RNU4-1 and other U4 homologs, supporting RNU4-2s role as the primary U4 transcript in the brain. Overall, this work underscores the importance of non-coding genes in rare disorders. It will provide a diagnosis to thousands of individuals with NDD worldwide and pave the way for the development of effective treatments for these individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

Our understanding of how animals evolved this exquisite regulatory control remains elusive, but evidence suggests that changes in chromatin-based mechanisms may have contributed. To investigate this possibility, here we examine chromatin-based gene regulatory features in the closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. Using Salpingoeca rosetta as a model system, we examined chromatin accessibility and histone modifications at the genome scale and compared these features to gene expression. We first observed that accessible regions of chromatin are primarily associated with gene promoters and found no evidence of distal gene regulatory elements resembling the enhancers that animals deploy to regulate developmental gene expression. Remarkably, a histone modification deposited by polycomb repressive complex 2, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), appeared to function similarly in S. rosetta to its role in animals, because this modification decorated genes with cell type-specific expression. Additionally, H3K27me3 marked transposons, retaining what appears to be an ancestral role in regulating these elements. We further uncovered a putative new bivalent chromatin state at cell type-specific genes that consists of H3K27me3 and histone H3 lysine 4 mono-methylation (H3K4me1). Together, our discoveries support the scenario that gene-associated histone modification states that underpin development emerged before the evolution of animal multicellularity.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Neural pathologies are often associated with anatomical changes in these axonal projections and synaptic connections. Notably, axonal density variations of local and long-range projections increase or decrease as a function of the strengthening or weakening, respectively, of the information flow between brain regions. Traditionally, histological quantification of axonal inputs relied on assessing the mean fluorescence intensity within a rectangle placed in the brain region-of-interest. Despite yielding valuable insights, this conventional method is notably susceptible to background fluorescence, post-acquisition adjustments, and inter-researcher variability. Additionally, it fails to account for the non-uniform innervation across brain regions, thus overlooking critical data such as innervation percentages and axonal distribution patterns. In response to these chal-lenges, we introduce AxoDen, an open-source semi-automated platform designed to increase the speed and rigor of axon quantifications for basic neuroscience discovery. AxoDen processes user-defined brain regions-of-interests incorporating dynamic thresholding of grayscales-transformed images to facilitate binarized pixel measurements. Thereby AxoDen segregates the image content into signal and non-signal categories, effectively eliminating background interference and enabling the exclusive measurement of fluorescence from axonal projections. AxoDen provides detailed and accurate representations of axonal density and spatial distribution. AxoDen's advanced yet user-friendly platform enhances the reliability and efficiency of axonal density analysis and facilitates access to unbiased high-quality data analysis with no technical background or coding experience required.

Here we identify the co-activated mouse VTA neuronal ensembles for reward and stress, and determine their role in adaptive behaviors. We show that stimuli of opposite valence (opioid vs acute social stress) recruit two segregated intermingled small VTA neuronal ensembles. These two ensembles continue to be preferentially engaged by congruent valence stimuli. Stimulation of VTA stress- or reward ensembles is aversive/reinforcing, respectively. Strikingly, external valence stimuli fully require activity of these small discrete VTA ensembles for conferring approach/avoidance outcomes. Overall, our study identifies distinct small VTA ensembles for positive and negative valence coding and shows their indispensability for adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Here we show that the catenulid Stenostomum brevipharyngium, a member of the earliest-branching flatworm lineage, lacks conventional neoblasts despite being capable of whole-body regeneration and asexual reproduction. Using a combination of single-nuclei transcriptomics, in situ gene expression analysis, and functional experiments, we find that cell divisions are not restricted to a single cell type and are associated with multiple fully differentiated somatic tissues. Furthermore, the cohort of germline multipotency genes, which are considered canonical neoblast markers, are not expressed in dividing cells, but in the germline instead, and we experimentally show that they are neither necessary for proliferation nor regeneration. Overall, our results challenge the notion that canonical neoblasts are necessary for flatworm regeneration and open up the possibility that neoblast-like cells may have evolved convergently in different animals, independent of their regenerative capacity.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, the significance and biological determinants of these functional alterations remain unclear. Here, we use a cross-species design to investigate the developmental trajectory and neural underpinnings of brain dysconnectivity in 22q11DS. We find that LgDel mice, an established mouse model of 22q11DS, exhibit age-specific patterns of functional MRI (fMRI) dysconnectivity, with widespread fMRI hyper-connectivity in juvenile mice reverting to focal hippocampal hypoconnectivity over puberty. These fMRI connectivity alterations are mirrored by co-occurring developmental alterations in dendritic spine density, and are both transiently normalized by developmental GSK3{beta} inhibition, suggesting a synaptic origin for this phenomenon. Notably, analogous hyper-to hypoconnectivity reconfiguration occurs also in human 22q11DS, where it affects hippocampal and cortical regions spatially enriched for synaptic genes that interact with GSK3{beta}, and autism-relevant transcripts. Functional dysconnectivity in somatomotor components of this network is predictive of age-dependent social alterations in 22q11.2 deletion carriers.

Here we document the prevalence of gastrointestinal issues in patients with large-effect variants in sixteen of these genes, highlighting dysmotility, consistent with potential enteric neuron dysfunction. Using the high-throughput diploid frog Xenopus tropicalis, we individually target five of these genes (SYNGAP1, CHD8, SCN2A, CHD2, and DYRK1A) and observe disrupted enteric neuronal progenitor migration for each. More extensive analysis of DYRK1A reveals that perturbation causes gut dysmotility in vivo, which can be ameliorated by treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) or a serotonin receptor 6 agonist, identified by in vivo drug screening.

To localize the ancestral and geographical origins of the Yamnaya among the diverse Eneolithic people that preceded them, we studied ancient DNA data from 428 individuals of which 299 are reported for the first time, demonstrating three previously unknown Eneolithic genetic clines. First, a ""Caucasus-Lower Volga"" (CLV) Cline suffused with Caucasus hunter-gatherer (CHG) ancestry extended between a Caucasus Neolithic southern end in Neolithic Armenia, and a steppe northern end in Berezhnovka in the Lower Volga. Bidirectional gene flow across the CLV cline created admixed intermediate populations in both the north Caucasus, such as the Maikop people, and on the steppe, such as those at the site of Remontnoye north of the Manych depression. CLV people also helped form two major riverine clines by admixing with distinct groups of European hunter-gatherers. A ""Volga Cline"" was formed as Lower Volga people mixed with upriver populations that had more Eastern hunter-gatherer (EHG) ancestry, creating genetically hyper-variable populations as at Khvalynsk in the Middle Volga. A ""Dnipro Cline"" was formed as CLV people bearing both Caucasus Neolithic and Lower Volga ancestry moved west and acquired Ukraine Neolithic hunter-gatherer (UNHG) ancestry to establish the population of the Serednii Stih culture from which the direct ancestors of the Yamnaya themselves were formed around 4000BCE. This population grew rapidly after 3750-3350BCE, precipitating the expansion of people of the Yamnaya culture who totally displaced previous groups on the Volga and further east, while admixing with more sedentary groups in the west. CLV cline people with Lower Volga ancestry contributed four fifths of the ancestry of the Yamnaya, but also, entering Anatolia from the east, contributed at least a tenth of the ancestry of Bronze Age Central Anatolians, where the Hittite language, related to the Indo-European languages spread by the Yamnaya, was spoken. We thus propose that the final unity of the speakers of the ""Proto-Indo-Anatolian"" ancestral language of both Anatolian and Indo-European languages can be traced to CLV cline people sometime between 4400-4000 BCE.

Genetic reconstruction of the ancestry of Pontic-Caspian steppe and West Asian populations points to the North Caucasus-Lower Volga area as the homeland of Indo-Anatolian languages and to the Serednii Stih archaeological culture of the Dnipro-Don area as the homeland of Indo-European languages. The Caucasus-Lower Volga people had diverse distal roots, estimated using the qpAdm software on the left barplot, as Caucasus hunter-gatherer (purple), Central Asian (red), Eastern hunter-gatherer (pink), and West Asian Neolithic (green). Caucasus-Lower Volga expansions, estimated using qpAdm on the right barplot as disseminated Caucasus Neolithic (blue)-Lower Volga Eneolithic (orange) proximal ancestries, mixing with the inhabitants of the North Pontic region (yellow), Volga region (yellow), and West Asia (green).

We performed SNCA long-read RNA sequencing in human dopaminergic neurons and show that annotated SNCA transcripts account for only 5% of expression. Rather, the majority of expression (75%) at the SNCA locus originates from transcripts with alternative 5 and 3 untranslated regions. Importantly, 10% originates from transcripts encoding open reading frames not previously annotated, which are translated and detectable in human postmortem brain. Defining the 3 untranslated regions enabled the rational design of antisense oligonucleotides targeting the majority of SNCA transcripts, leading to the effective reversal of PD pathology, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and toxicity. Resolving the complexity of the SNCA transcriptional landscape impacts RNA therapies and highlights differences in protein isoforms and their contribution to disease.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Here we have expanded our analysis to cover all 5,734 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data sets currently available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, covering 25 distinct types of cancer. We analyzed the microbial content using updated computational methods and databases, and compared our results to those from two major recent studies that focused on bacteria, viruses, and fungi in cancer. Our results expand upon and reinforce our recent findings, which showed that the presence of microbes is far smaller than had been previously reported, and that most species identified in TCGA data are either not present at all, or are known contaminants rather than microbes residing within tumors. As part of this expanded analysis, and to help others avoid being misled by flawed data, we have released a dataset that contains detailed read counts for bacteria, viruses, archaea, and fungi detected in all 5,734 TCGA samples, which can serve as a public reference for future investigations.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

The location of pairs of identical sequences is highly consistent with expectations from mobility and social contact data. Outliers in the relationship between genetic and mobility data can be explained by SARS-CoV-2 transmission between postal codes with male prisons, consistent with transmission between prison facilities.

This work uses comparative metagenomics of a recently evolved but understudied ANME group,  Candidatus Methanovorans (ANME-3) to identify evolutionary processes and innovations at work in ANME which may be obscured in earlier evolved lineages. Within members of Methanovorans, we identified convergent evolution in carbon and energy metabolic genes as likely drivers of ANME evolution. We also identified erosion of genes required for methylotrophic methanogenesis along with horizontal acquisition of multi-heme cytochromes and other loci uniquely associated with ANME. The assembly and comparative analysis of multiple Methanovorans genomes offers important functional context for understanding the niche-defining metabolic differences between methane-oxidizing ANME and their methanogen relatives. Furthermore, this work illustrates the multiple evolutionary modes at play in the transition to a novel and globally important metabolic niche.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Previous work assembled YAG transcripts based on their targeted sequencing but not using reference genome assemblies, potentially resulting in an incomplete transcript repertoire. Here we used the recently produced gapless telomere-to-telomere (T2T) Y chromosome assemblies of great ape species (bonobo, chimpanzee, human, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, and Sumatran orangutan) and analyzed RNA data from whole-testis samples for the same species. We generated hybrid transcriptome assemblies by combining targeted long reads (Pacific Biosciences), untargeted long reads (Pacific Biosciences) and untargeted short reads (Illumina)and mapping them to the T2T reference genomes. Compared to the results from the reference-free approach, average transcript length was more than two times higher, and the total number of transcripts decreased three times, improving the quality of the assembled transcriptome. The reference-based transcriptome assemblies allowed us to differentiate transcripts originating from different Y chromosome gene copies and from their non-Y chromosome homologs. We identified two sources of transcriptome diversity--alternative splicing and gene duplication with subsequent diversification of gene copies. For each gene family, we detected transcribed pseudogenes along with protein-coding gene copies. We revealed previously unannotated gene copies of YAGs as compared to currently available NCBI annotations, as well as novel isoforms for annotated gene copies. This analysis paves the way for better understanding Y chromosome gene functions, which is important given their role in spermatogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has MCSs with a variety of organelles in the cell. MCSs are dynamic, responding to changes in cell state, and are therefore best visualized through inducible labeling methods. However, existing methods typically distort ER-MCSs, by expanding contacts or creating artificial ones. Here we describe a new method for inducible labeling of ER-MCSs using the Lamin B receptor (LBR) and a generic anchor protein on the partner organelle. Termed LaBeRling, this versatile, one-to-many approach allows labeling of different types of ER-MCSs (mitochondria, plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), on-demand, in interphase or mitotic cells. LaBeRling is non-disruptive and does not change ER-MCSs in terms of the contact number, extent or distance measured; as determined by light microscopy or a deep-learning volume electron microscopy approach. We applied this method to study the changes in ER-MCSs during mitosis and to label novel ER-Golgi contact sites at different mitotic stages in live cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, how vaccines, emergent variants, and their intersection shift host responses in the human nasal mucosa remains uncharacterized. We and others have shown during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave that a muted nasal epithelial interferon response at the site of infection underlies severe COVID-19. We sought to further understand how upper airway cell subsets and states associate with COVID-19 phenotypes across viral variants and vaccination. Here, we integrated new single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 67 adult participants during the Delta and Omicron waves with data from 45 participants collected during the original (Ancestral) wave in our prior study. By characterizing detailed cellular states during infection, we identified changes in epithelial and immune cells that are both unique and shared across variants and vaccination status. By defining SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ cells for each variant, we found that Delta samples had a marked increase in the abundance of viral RNA+ cells. Despite this dramatic increase in viral RNA+ cells in Delta cases, the nasal cellular compositions of Delta and Omicron exhibit greater similarity, driven partly by myeloid subsets, than the Ancestral landscapes associated with specialized epithelial subsets. We found that vaccination prior to infection was surprisingly associated with nasal macrophage recruitment and activation rather than adaptive immune cell signatures. While patients with severe disease caused by Ancestral or Delta variants had muted interferon responses, Omicron-infected patients had equivalent interferon responses regardless of disease severity. Our study defines the evolution of cellular targets and signatures of disease severity in the upper respiratory tract across SARS-CoV-2 variants, and suggests that intramuscular vaccines shape myeloid responses in the nasal mucosa upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

To develop a targeted bottom-up proteomics assay, peptides must be evaluated as proxies for the measurement of a protein or proteoform in a biological matrix. Candidate peptide selection typically relies on predetermined biochemical properties, data from semi-stochastic sampling, or by empirical measurements. These strategies require extensive testing and method refinement due to the difficulties associated with prediction of peptide response in the biological matrix of interest. Gas-phase fractionated (GPF) narrow window data-independent acquisition (DIA) aids in the development of reproducible selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays by providing matrix-specific information on peptide detectability and quantification by mass spectrometry. To demonstrate the suitability of DIA data for selecting peptide targets, we reimplement a portion of an existing assay to measure 98 Alzheimer's disease proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Peptides were selected from GPF-DIA based on signal intensity and reproducibility. The resulting SRM assay exhibits similar quantitative precision to published data, despite the inclusion of different peptides between the assays. This workflow enables development of new assays without additional up-front data acquisition, demonstrated here through generation of a separate assay for an unrelated set of proteins in CSF from the same dataset.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

During blood-stage infection, Plasmodium falciparum parasites internalize and digest abundant host hemoglobin within the digestive vacuole. This massive catabolic process generates copious free heme, most of which is biomineralized into inert hemozoin. Parasites also express a divergent heme oxygenase (HO)-like protein (PfHO) that lacks key active-site residues and has lost canonical HO activity. The cellular role of this unusual protein that underpins its retention by parasites has been unknown. To unravel PfHO function, we first determined a 2.8 [A]-resolution X-ray structure that revealed a highly -helical fold indicative of distant HO homology. Localization studies unveiled PfHO targeting to the apicoplast organelle, where it is imported and undergoes N-terminal processing but retains most of the electropositive transit peptide. We observed that conditional knockdown of PfHO was lethal to parasites, which died from defective apicoplast biogenesis and impaired isoprenoid-precursor synthesis. Complementation and molecular-interaction studies revealed an essential role for the electropositive N-terminus of PfHO, which selectively associates with the apicoplast genome and enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. PfHO knockdown resulted in a specific deficiency in levels of apicoplast-encoded RNA but not DNA. These studies reveal an essential function for PfHO in apicoplast maintenance and suggest that Plasmodium repurposed the conserved HO scaffold from its canonical heme-degrading function in the ancestral chloroplast to fulfill a critical adaptive role in organelle gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

E. faecalis also causes infections in root canals, wounds, the urinary tract, and on heart valves. E. faecalis metabolizes arginine through the arginine deiminase (ADI) pathway, which converts arginine to ornithine and releases ATP, ammonia, and CO2. E. faecalis arginine metabolism also affects virulence of other pathogens during co-culture. E. faecalis may encounter elevated levels of arginine in the GIT or the oral cavity, where arginine is used as a dental therapeutic. Little is known about how E. faecalis responds to growth in arginine in the absence of other bacteria. To address this, we used RNAseq and additional assays to measure growth, gene expression, and biofilm formation in E. faecalis OG1RF grown in arginine. We demonstrate that arginine decreases E. faecalis biofilm production and causes widespread differential expression of genes related to metabolism, quorum sensing, and polysaccharide synthesis. Growth in arginine also increases aggregation of E. faecalis and promotes decreased susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and ceftriaxone.

We found that a single 16-minute bout of 40Hz PVN stimulation session restored normal loudness perception for one week, showing that perceptual deficits triggered by irreversible peripheral injuries can be reversed through targeted cortical circuit interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, the identification of antibodies that disrupt target functions beyond binding remains a challenge. In particular, there are very few strategies that support identification and engineering of either protein-based irreversible binders or inhibitory enzyme binders. Expanding the range of chemistries in antibody libraries has the potential to lead to efficient discovery of function-disrupting antibodies. In this work, we describe a yeast display-based platform for the discovery of chemically diversified antibodies. We constructed a billion-member antibody library that supports the presentation of a range of chemistries within antibody variable domains via noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) incorporation and subsequent bioorthogonal click chemistry conjugations. Use of a polyspecific orthogonal translation system enables introduction of chemical groups with various properties, including photo-reactive, proximity-reactive, and click chemistry-enabled functional groups for library screening. We established conjugation conditions that facilitate modification of the full library, demonstrating the feasibility of sorting the full billion-member library in ""protein-small molecule hybrid"" format in future work. Here, we conducted initial library screens after introducing O-(2-bromoethyl)tyrosine (OBeY), a weakly electrophilic ncAA capable of undergoing proximity-induced crosslinking to a target. Enrichments against donkey IgG and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) each led to the identification of several OBeY-substituted clones that bind to the targets of interest. Flow cytometry analysis on the yeast surface confirmed higher retention of binding for OBeY-substituted clones compared to clones substituted with ncAAs lacking electrophilic side chains after denaturation. However, subsequent crosslinking experiments in solution with ncAA-substituted clones yielded inconclusive results, suggesting that weakly reactive OBeY side chain is not sufficient to drive robust crosslinking in the clones isolated here. Nonetheless, this work establishes a multi-modal, chemically expanded antibody library and demonstrates the feasibility of conducting discovery campaigns in chemically expanded format. This versatile platform offers new opportunities for identifying and characterizing antibodies with properties beyond what is accessible with the canonical amino acids, potentially enabling discovery of new classes of reagents, diagnostics, and even therapeutic leads.

Inflorescence architecture depends on shape, longevity and determinacy of meristems that direct growth of the main rachis and lateral branches, but how individual meristem activities are determined and integrated within complex inflorescences is not yet understood. We found that activity of distinct meristems in the barley inflorescence is coordinated by a signalling pathway comprising the receptor like kinase Hordeum vulgare CLAVATA1 (HvCLV1) and the secreted CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (CLE)-family peptide FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (HvFCP1). HvFCP1 interacts with HvCLV1 to promote spikelet formation but restricts inflorescence meristem and rachilla meristem proliferation. Hvfcp1 or Hvclv1 mutants generate branched inflorescences with additional rows of spikelets and supernumerary florets. Transcriptome analysis reveals that HvFCP1/HvCLV1 signalling controls inflorescence branching through the regulation of trehalose-6-phosphate synthesis and sugar transport. Our discoveries reveal the potential to engineer barley inflorescence architecture by manipulating regulation of distinct meristem activities.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

We performed a deep-sequencing experiment using PacBio HiFi reads to obtain metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a pooled human gut microbiome. We performed long-read metagenome assembly using two methods (hifiasm-meta, metMDBG), used improved bioinformatic and proximity ligation binning strategies to cluster contigs and identify MAGs, and developed a novel framework to compare and consolidate MAGs (pb-MAG-mirror). We found proximity ligation binning yielded more MAGs than bioinformatic binning, but our novel comparison framework resulted in higher MAG yields than either binning strategy individually. In total, from 255 Gbp of total HiFi data we produced 595 total MAGs (including 175 high-quality MAGs) using hifiasm-meta, and 547 total MAGs (including 277 high-quality MAGs) with metaMDBG. Hifiasm-meta assembled almost twice as many strain-level MAGs as metaMDBG (246 vs. 156), but both assembly methods produced up to five strains for a species. Approximately 85% of the MAGs were assigned to known species, but we recovered >35 high-quality MAGs that represent uncultured diversity. Based on strict similarity scores, we found 125 MAGs were unequivocally shared across the assembly methods at the strain level, representing [~]22% of the total MAGs recovered per method. Finally, we detected more total viral sequences in the metaMDBG assembly versus the hifiasm-meta assembly ([~]6,700 vs. [~]4,500). Overall, we find the use of HiFi sequencing, improved metagenome assembly methods, and complementary binning strategies is highly effective for rapidly cataloging microbial genomes in complex microbiomes.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Previous studies have identified molecular phenotypes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein that contribute to pandemic potential in humans, including cell entry, receptor preference, HA stability, and reduced neutralization by polyclonal sera3-6. However, prior experimental work has only measured how these phenotypes are affected by a handful of the >10,000 different possible amino-acid mutations to HA. Here we use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning7 to measure how all mutations to a 2.3.4.4b H5 HA affect each phenotype. We identify mutations that allow HA to better bind 2-6-linked sialic acids, and show that some viruses already carry mutations that stabilize HA. We also measure how all HA mutations affect neutralization by sera from mice and ferrets vaccinated against or infected with 2.3.4.4b H5 viruses. These antigenic maps enable rapid assessment of when new viral strains have acquired mutations that may create mismatches with candidate vaccine strains.

Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) is one of the most common forms of acquired chromosome abnormality in men, which has been reported to be associated with increased risk of various chronic progressive diseases including fibrotic diseases. However, the exact role of mLOY in the development of PF remains elusive and to be elucidated. Methods: We adopted three complementary approaches to explore the role of mLOY in the pathogenesis of PF. We used copy number on chromosome Y to estimate mLOY comparing patients in PROFILE and gnomAD cohorts and between cases and control patients from the GE100KGP cohort. Correlation of mLOY with demographic and clinical variables was tested using patients from PROFILE cohort. Lung single-cell transcriptomic data were analysed to assess the cell types implicated in mLOY. We performed Mendelian randomisation to examine the causal relationship between mLOY, IPF, and telomere length. Results: The genetic analysis suggests that mLOY is found in PF from both case cohorts but when compared with an age matched population the effect is minimal (P = 0.0032). mLOY is related to age (P = 0.00021) and shorter telomere length (P = 0.0081) rather than PF severity or progression. Single-cell analysis indicates that mLOY appears to be found primarily in immune cells and appears to be related to presence and severity of fibrosis. Mendelian randomisation demonstrates that mLOY is not on the causal pathway for IPF, but partial evidence supports that telomere shortening is on the causal pathway for mLOY. Conclusion: Our study confirms the existence of mLOY in PF patients and suggests that mLOY is not a major driver of IPF. The combined evidence suggests a triangulation model where telomere shortening leads to both IPF and mLOY.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

This swimming mode significantly influences the way in which fish integrate information and make decisions in a social context. Here, we introduce a simplified fish school model in which individuals have an asynchronous burst-and-coast swimming mode and selectively interact only with one or two neighbors that exert the largest influence on their behavior and over a limited spatial range. The interactions consist for a fish to be attracted and aligned with these neighbors. We show that, by adjusting the interactions between individuals above a sufficiently high level, depending on the relative strength of attraction and alignment, the model is able to produce a cohesive fish school that replicates the main collective phases observed in nature: schooling, milling and swarming when each individual interacts with only one neighbor, and schooling and swarming when each individual interacts with two neighbors. Moreover, the model shows that these patterns can be maintained over long simulations. However, with the exception of swarming, these patterns do not persist indefinitely in time and fish lose cohesion and progressively disperse. We further identify the mechanisms leading to the dispersion.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

In eukaryotes, recognition of the A-site stop codon and release of the polypeptide are mediated by release factors eRF1 and eRF3, respectively. Translation termination is modulated by other factors which either directly interact with release factors or bind to the E-site and modulate the activity of the peptidyl transferase center. Previous studies suggested that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ABCF ATPase New1 is involved in translation termination and/or ribosome recycling, however, the exact function remained unclear. Here, we have applied 5PSeq, single-particle cryo-EM and readthrough reporter assays to provide insight into the biological function of New1. We show that the lack of New1 results in ribosomal stalling at stop codons preceded by a lysine or arginine codon and that the stalling is not defined by the nature of the C-terminal amino acid but rather by the identity of the tRNA isoacceptor in the P-site. Collectively, our results suggest that translation termination is inefficient when ribosomes have specific tRNA isoacceptors in the P-site and that the recruitment of New1 rescues ribosomes at these problematic termination contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Currently, asymmetry-based methods cannot be applied to a pair of populations and such analyses are instead performed using model-based methods. Here we investigate genealogical asymmetry under a two-population isolation-migration model. We focus on genealogies where the first coalescence event is between lineages sampled from different populations, as the external branches of these genealogies have equal expected length as long as there is no post-divergence gene flow. We show that unidirectional gene flow breaks this symmetry and results in the recipient population having longer external branches. We derive expectations for the probability of this genealogical asymmetry under the isolation-migration model and propose a simple statistic (Am) to detect it from genome sequence data. Am provides a two-taxon test for gene flow that only requires a single unphased diploid genome from each population, with no outgroup information. We use analytic expectations and coalescent simulations to explore how recombination, unequal effective population sizes and bidirectional gene flow influence Am and find that the statistic provides unambiguous evidence for gene flow under a continent-island history. We estimate Am for genome sequence data from Heliconius butterflies and Odocoileus deer, generating results consistent with previous model-based analyses. Our work highlights a signal of gene flow overlooked to date and provides a method that complements existing approaches for investigating the demographic history of recently diverged populations.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Upon SMO activation, GRK2 rapidly relocalizes from the ciliary base to the shaft, triggering SMO phosphorylation and PKA-C interaction. Reconstitution studies reveal that GRK2 phosphorylation enables active SMO to bind PKA-C directly. Lastly, the SMO-GRK2-PKA pathway underlies Hh signal transduction in a range of cellular and in vivo models. Thus, GRK2 phosphorylation of ciliary SMO, and the ensuing PKA-C binding and inactivation, are critical initiating events for the intracellular steps in Hh signaling.

A recent notion that most psychotropics are detrimental to the gut microbiota has arisen from consistent findings of metabolic adverse effects. However, unlike olanzapine, the metabolic effects of lurasidone are conflicting, with most reports observing weight loss rather than gain. Thus, this study investigates the contrasting effects of olanzapine and lurasidone on the gut microbiota to explore the hypothesis of ""gut neutrality"" for lurasidone exposure.

Experimental ApproachUsing a Sprague-Dawley rat model, the impact of olanzapine and lurasidone administration on the gut microbiota was explored. Faecal and blood samples were collected weekly over a 21-day period to analyse changes to the gut microbiota and related metabolic markers.

Key ResultsLurasidone triggered no significant weight gain or metabolic alterations, instead positively modulating gut microbiota through increases in mean OTUs (+50 OTUs) and alpha diversity (+0.5 increase in Shannons index). This novel finding suggests an underlying mechanism for lurasidones metabolic inertia. In contrast, olanzapine triggered a statistically significant decrease in mean OTUs (-75 OTUs) and substantial compositional variation, suggesting a decrease in microbial richness. Microbiota alterations correlated with metabolic dysfunction, evidenced through a statistically significant 30% increase in weight gain, increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and increase in blood triglycerides and glycaemic levels.

Conclusion and ImplicationsThe study challenges the notion that all antipsychotics disrupt the gut microbiota similarly and highlights the potential benefits of gut positive or neutral antipsychotics like lurasidone in managing metabolic side effects.

The recovery of mammalian predators of conservation concern in Europe is a success story, but their impact on some prey species of conservation concern may cause conservation dilemmas. This calls for effective intervention strategies that mitigate predator impacts without compromising their recovery.

2. We evaluated diversionary feeding as a management intervention tool to reduce depredation on nests of rapidly declining Western capercaillies in Scotland. We studied the influence of diversionary feeding provision on the fates of artificial nests deployed using a replicated and representative randomised landscape-scale experiment. This comprised 30 paired control (no diversionary feeding) and treatment (diversionary feeding applied) sites, 60 in total, each containing six artificial nests distributed across 600 km2. The experiment was replicated over two years, and in the second year, the control-treatment pairs were reversed, yielding 60 treatment and 60 control sites and 720 artificial nests.

3. Diversionary feeding substantially reduced depredation of artificial nests, translating into an 83% increase in predicted nest survival over 28 days of incubation. The increase in survival was mostly accounted for by a reduction in the probability that a pine marten, the main nest predator, consumed or cached eggs. Diversionary food also significantly reduced nest predation by badgers, although the magnitude of this effect varied by year.

4. Diversionary feeding is an easily employable method shown in this study to reduce predator impact (functional) without lethal (numerical) intervention. Managers should proceed with its application for conserving capercaillie in Scotland without delay.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, most models have been applied in unperturbed contexts, precluding a predictive understanding of how chromatin state responds to TF perturbation. Here, we used transfer learning to train and interpret deep learning models that use DNA sequence to predict, with accuracy approaching experimental reproducibility, how the concentration of two dosage-sensitive TFs (TWIST1, SOX9) affects regulatory element (RE) chromatin accessibility in facial progenitor cells. High-affinity motifs that allow for heterotypic TF co-binding and are concentrated at the center of REs buffer against quantitative changes in TF dosage and strongly predict unperturbed accessibility. In contrast, motifs with low-affinity or homotypic binding distributed throughout REs lead to sensitive responses with minimal contributions to unperturbed accessibility. Both buffering and sensitizing features show signatures of purifying selection. We validated these predictive sequence features using reporter assays and showed that a biophysical model of TF-nucleosome competition can explain the sensitizing effect of low-affinity motifs. Our approach of combining transfer learning and quantitative measurements of the chromatin response to TF dosage therefore represents a powerful method to reveal additional layers of the cis-regulatory code.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Here we introduce LotOfCells: a simple R package designed to explore the intricate landscape of phenotypic data within single-cell studies. Normally, we are interested in visualizing and measuring if the differences in the proportion of number of cells across various covariates is significant or biologically relevant. As an example, one of the most common questions is the proportion of different cell types across conditions in our experiment, or the cluster composition before and after treatment (e.g.: difference in cell type proportions between wild type and mutant). LotOfCells helps with the interpretation and visualization of meta-data of these recurrent scenarios, including the test of proportion changes across multiple ordered stages. Additionally, it computes a symmetric divergence score to measure global deregulation of cell proportions due to a condition.

However, laboratory studies typically simplify reality and focus on the effects of an individual stressor. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to simultaneously provide a physical stressor (shear flow) and a chemical stressor (H2O2) to the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By treating cells with levels of flow and H2O2 that commonly co-occur in nature, we discover that previous reports significantly overestimate the H2O2 levels required to block bacterial growth. Specifically, we establish that flow increases H2O2 effectiveness 50-fold, explaining why previous studies lacking flow required much higher concentrations. Using natural H2O2 levels, we identify the core H2O2 regulon, characterize OxyR-mediated dynamic regulation, and dissect the redundant roles of multiple H2O2 scavenging systems. By examining single-cell behavior, we serendipitously discover that the combined effects of H2O2 and flow block pilus-driven surface migration. Thus, our results counter previous studies and reveal that natural levels of H2O2 and flow synergize to restrict bacterial colonization and survival. By studying two stressors at once, our research highlights the limitations of oversimplifying nature and demonstrates that physical and chemical stress can combine to yield unpredictable effects.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Piezos undergo large conformational changes, induce far-reaching deformation onto the membrane, and modulate the function of two-pore potassium (K2P) channels. Taken together, this led us to hypothesize that Piezos may be able to signal their conformational state to other nearby proteins. Here, we use chemical control to acutely restrict Piezo1 conformational flexibility and show that Piezo1 conformational changes, but not ion permeation through it, are required for modulating the K2P channel TREK1. Super-resolution imaging and stochastic simulations further reveal that both channels do not co-localize, which implies that modulation is not mediated through direct binding interactions; however, at high Piezo1 densities, most TREK1 channels are within the predicted Piezo1 membrane footprint, suggesting the footprint may underlie conformational signaling. We speculate that physiological roles originally attributed to Piezo1 ionotropic function could, alternatively, involve conformational signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Long-read sequencing data alone or in hybrid mode combined with more accurate short-read sequences facilitate the de novo assembly of genomes. A number of software exists for de novo genome assembly from long-read data although specific performance comparisons to assembly human genomes are lacking. Here we benchmarked 11 different pipelines including four long-read only assemblers and three hybrid assemblers, combined with four polishing schemes for de novo genome assembly of a human reference material sequenced with Oxford Nanopore Technologies and Illumina. In addition, the best performing choice was validated in a non-reference routine laboratory sample. Software performance was evaluated by assessing the quality of the assemblies with QUAST, BUSCO, and Merqury metrics, and the computational costs associated with each of the pipelines were also assessed. We found that Flye was superior to all other assemblers, especially when relying on Ratatosk error-corrected long-reads. Polishing improved the accuracy and continuity of the assemblies and the combination of two rounds of Racon and Pilon achieved the best results. The assembly of the non-reference sample showed comparable assembly metrics as those of the reference material.

Here we first investigated 196 taxa for their association with three hallmark properties of health and microbiome-resilience, namely prevalence/community-influence in non-diseased subjects, longitudinal stability and host health, using a discovery cohort of 39,926 publicly available adult (> 18 years) gut microbiomes from 127 studies spanning 42 countries and 28 disease conditions (including 9,434 longitudinal samples). We identified 18 species-level-taxa, referred to as  Health-Associated Core Keystones (HACKs), with association-strengths in the top 30 percentile for all three properties. We integrated these association-strengths into a single value, the HACK-index, that ranks taxa based on their estimated contribution to both microbiome stability and host health. We then demonstrate the reproducibility of these indices for the taxon associations with the three properties, using a validation cohort of 4,500 gut microbiomes (from 11 studies with various demographics and diseases). Specific consortia of high HACK-index taxa are also associated with positive response to Mediterranean Diet interventions and Immuno-Checkpoint-Inhibitor therapies. We finally identify the distinguishing microbial genomic functions associated with high HACK-indices/HACK-taxa that can be investigated using targeted mechanistic studies to identify microbiome effectors of improved health.

The availability of HACK-indices provides a rational basis for microbiome comparisons and will facilitate the selection and design of microbiome-based therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, the relationships and feedbacks between virus dynamics, microbial host dynamics, and environmental disturbance is not understood. Centralia, PA, USA, is the site of an underground coal seam fire that has been burning for over 60 years. As the fire moves along the coal seam, previously heated soils cool to ambient temperature, creating a gradient of heat disturbance intensity and recovery. We examined annual soil viral population dynamics over seven consecutive years in Centralia using untargeted metagenome sequencing. Viral communities changed over time and were distinct between fire-affected and reference sites. Dissimilarity in viral communities was greater across sites (space) than within a site across years (time), and cumulative viral diversity more rapidly stabilized within a site across years than within a year across sites. There also were changes in CRISPR investment as soils cooled, corresponding to shifts in viral diversity. Finally, there were also differences in viral-encoded auxiliary metabolic genes between fire-affected and reference sites. These results indicate that despite high site-to-site soil viral diversity, there was surprising viral community consistency within a site over the years and shifting host-viral interactions in soils recovering from disturbance. Together, these results provide insights into how viral and host communities collectively respond to unpredicted environmental disturbance.

However, the complexity, binding dependencies and temporal effects of their action remain unclear. Here, we dissect how the pioneer TF GATA6 triggers Primitive Endoderm (PrE) differentiation from pluripotent cells. We show that transient GATA6 binding exploits accessible regions to decommission active enhancers and promote pluripotency gene silencing. Simultaneously, GATA6 targets closed chromatin and initiates an extensive remodeling culminating in the establishment of fragile nucleosomes flanked by ordered nucleosome arrays and increased accessibility. This is directly enhanced by rapidly expressed PrE TFs (SOX17) and by pluripotency TFs repurposed for differentiation (OCT4/SOX2). Furthermore, GATA6 mediates the replacement of essential nuclear receptors for PrE differentiation, from ESRRB to ESRRA. Therefore, pioneer TFs orchestrate a complex gene regulatory network involving many if not all available pioneer TFs, including those required to support the original identity of differentiating cells.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

To understand how biochemical constraints shaped protein structural evolution, we coupled the extensive genetic and metabolic data from the Saccharomycotina subphylum with the capability of AlphaFold2 to systematically predict protein structures from sequence. Determining how 11,269 enzyme structures catalysing 361 different metabolic reactions evolved over 400 million years alongside their molecular functions, we report that metabolism has shaped the structural evolution of enzymes at different levels: the organisms overall metabolism; the topological organisation of the metabolic network; and each enzymes molecular properties. For example, structural evolution depends on each enzymes reaction mechanism, on the variability rather than the amount of metabolic flux, and on biosynthetic cost. Evolutionary cost-optimization is stronger on highly abundant enzymes and acts differently on different structural domains, with the exception of small-molecule binding sites, which are prioritised over other structural domains and lack cost-optimisation. Finally, while enzyme surfaces are less constrained, surface residues can also be exposed to positive selection for the co-evolution of protein-protein interaction sites. Accessing AlphaFolds power to predict protein structures systematically and across species barriers, facilitating the integration of protein structures with functional genomics, we were thus able to map biological constraints which shape protein structural evolution at scale and over long timelines.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, cellular responses to small-molecule epigenetic inhibition are heterogenous and dependent on factors such as the genetic background, metabolic state, and on-/off-target engagement of individual small-molecule drugs. To determine the mechanisms that drive these heterogeneous cellular responses, we quantified chromatin, proteome, and transcriptome remodeling due to histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) -treated cells derived from diverse genetic backgrounds. We utilized high-throughput sample multiplexed proteomics and integrated intelligent data acquisition methods to map proteomes of cancer cell lines in response to HDACi. We determined cell type-specific and ubiquitous cellular responses based on the quantification of 10,621 total proteins. We then established how coordinated remodeling of the proteome, transcriptome and chromatin state of HDACi treated cancer cells revealed convergent (JUN, MAP2K3, CDKN1A) and divergent (CCND3, ASF1B, BRD7) molecular phenotypes. HDACi- regulated proteins differ greatly across cell lines owing to heterogeneous molecular states of these cell lines. Finally, we demonstrated that HDACi treatment drove a highly cell-type specific response that may in part be explained by cell line-specific off-target drug engagement.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

The ability to design crosses with high means that will maintain genetic variation in the population is the goal for long-term applications. Herein, we describe a new computational package for mate allocation in a breeding program. SimpleMating is a flexible and open-source R package originally designed to predict and optimize breeding crosses in crops with different reproductive systems and breeding designs. Divided into modules, SimpleMating first estimates the cross performance (criterion), such as mean parental average, cross total genetic value, and/or usefulness of a set of crosses. The second module implements an optimization algorithm to maximize a target criterion while minimizing next-generation inbreeding. The software is flexible, allowing users to specify the desired number of crosses, maximum/minimum number of crosses per parent, and the maximum value of the parent relationship for creating crosses. As an outcome, SimpleMating generates a mating plan from the target parental population using single or multi-trait criteria. As example, we implemented and tested SimpleMating in a simulated maize breeding program obtained through stochastic simulations. The crosses designed via SimpleMating showed large genetic mean over time (up to 22% more genetic gain than conventional genomic selection programs, with lower genetic diversity decrease over time), supporting the use of this tool, as well as the use of data-driven decisions in applied breeding programs.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

FtsZ recruits other proteins, collectively known as the divisome, that together remodel and constrict the envelope. Constriction is driven by peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall synthesis by the glycosyltransferase FtsW and the transpeptidase FtsI (FtsWI), but these enzymes require activation to function. How recruitment of FtsZ to the division site leads to FtsWI activation and constriction remains largely unknown. Previous work in our laboratory demonstrated that an FtsZ-binding protein, FzlA, is essential for activation of FtsWI in the alphaproteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Additionally, we found that FzlA also binds to a DNA translocase called FtsK, suggesting that it may link constriction activation to chromosome segregation. FzlA is conserved throughout alphaproteobacteria but has only been examined in detail in C. crescentus. Here, we explored whether FzlA function is conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. We assessed FzlA homologs from Rickettsia parkeri and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and found that, similar to C. crescentus FzlA, they bind directly to FtsZ and localize to midcell. The FtsZ-FzlA interaction interface is conserved, as we demonstrated that FzlA from each of the three species examined can bind to FtsZ from any of the three in vitro. Additionally, we determined that A. tumefaciens FzlA can fulfill the essential function of FzlA when produced in C. crescentus, indicating conservation of function. These results suggest that FzlA serves as an important regulator that coordinates chromosome segregation with envelope constriction across diverse alphaproteobacteria.

ImportanceCell division is essential for bacterial replication and must be highly regulated to ensure robust remodeling of the cell wall in coordination with segregation of the genome to daughter cells. In Caulobacter crescentus, FzlA plays a major role in regulating this process by activating cell wall synthesis in a manner that couples constriction to chromosome segregation. FzlA is broadly conserved in alphaproteobacteria suggesting it plays a similar function across this class of bacteria. Here we have shown that, indeed, FzlA biochemical interactions and function are conserved in diverse alphaproteobacteria. Because FzlA is conserved in alphaproteobacterial human pathogens, understanding this protein and its interactome could present therapeutic benefits by identifying potential antibiotic targets to treat infections.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

We describe the genomic epidemiological investigation of these events.

MethodWe did a retrospective, population-based study using culture-positive B. pertussis from Childrens Hospital of Fudan University (CHFU), the exclusive referral hospital for childhood notifiable infectious diseases, in Shanghai, China between June 2016 and March 2024.

We compared the genome sequences of Shanghai strains with 6450 Chinese and global strains.

FindingsCoincident with national situtation, pertussis cases upsurged post-COVID-19 in Shanghai. At CHFU, the number of confirmed cases (n=349) in the first three months of 2024 exceeded the total case of previously years (n[&le;]177). Post-COVID-19, patients shifted from predominantly infants (90%, 397/442) to widespread infection among older children (infant: 16%, 132/844), with vaccinated individuals surging from 31% (107/340) to 88% (664/756); MRBP prevalence increased from 60% (267/447) to 98% (830/845). The emergence and expansion of a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone with MLVA type 28, MR-MT28, uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated individuals, temporally strongly associated with the pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition. MR-MT28 exhibited increased expression of antigen genes including pertussis toxin genes, along with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical symtoms (e.g. wheezing, facial blushing, p<0{middle dot}01), higher proportion of normal chest computed tomography (p<0{middle dot}05) and lower hospitalization rate (p<0{middle dot}01). Phylogenomic clustering analysis revealed a higher proportion of MR-MT28 strains grouping into clusters representing putative transmission. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28, and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 (95% highest probability density: 2013-2017) after acquring several mutations, including a novel antigen allele prn150 and 23S rRNA A2047G mutation. Approximately one quarter (26%, 50/195) of MR-MT28 has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. MR-MT28 has been identified in four regions (Anhui, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangdong) of China and continuously detected in Shanghai and Beijing, suggesting domestic spread and colonization.

InterpretationWe identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, and provide evidence that pathogen evolution is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk and warrants global surveillance. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn the first two months of 2024, an unexpected upsurge in pertussis was seen in both China and Europe. Furthermore, the pertussis upsurge in China exhibited atypical patterns, including an age shift to older children, vaccine escape and a notable increase in macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis (MRBP) prevalence. We aimed to test the hypothesis linking pertussis upsurge and epidemiological transition to pathogen evolution. We searched PubMed for molecular epidemiology studies of macrolide-resistant Bordetella pertussis using the terms (""Bordetella pertussis"" OR ""pertussis"" OR ""whooping cough"") AND (""macrolide resistant"" OR ""erythromycin resistant"") for articles before March 2024 and identified 40 studies. MRBP has been reported in eight counties, including United States, United Kingdom, France, Iran, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan and China. While MRBP incidence in other countries remained low, it was notably high in China, accounting for 50% and even 90% of strains across various regions. The risk of MRBP spreading out of China was previously considered low, primarily because Chinese strains predominantly belonged to ptxP1-lineage, whereas the globally prevalent lineage was ptxP3. However, the situation is changing, as ptxP3-MRBP strains have been identified in multiple regions of China since 2017. In Shanghai, we identified a sharply increase of ptxP3-MRBP prevalence post-COVID-19, coinciding with pertussis age shift to older children and vaccine escape. A similar scenario was independently observed in Beijing. Additionanlly, there is a significant rise in pertussis cases since the beginning of 2024. Currently, there is a lack of study testing the link between pertussis upsurge, epidemiological transition, and the evolution of its causative pathogen.

Added value of this studyOur study identified a ptxP3-linage, macrolide-resistant novel clone, MR-MT28, which is uniquely capable of causing substantial infections among older children and vaccinated population, suggesting enhanced vaccine escape. The emergence and rapid expansion of MR-MT28 temporally strongly associated with the upsurge of pertussis cases, age shift, vaccine escape and notable rise in MRBP prevalence. MR-MT28 was characterized by increased expression of antigen genes long with high incidence of abnormal C-reactive protein, but associated with siginicantly milder clinical sytmptoms, which may prolong the interval before seeking medical care, thereby amplifying transmission opportunities. Phylogenomic clustering analysis indicated that MR-MT28 may have increased transmissibility. Therefore, MR-MT28 may have competitive advantages due to antimicrobial resistance, enhanced vaccine escape, increased opportunities for transmission and transmissibility. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of MR-MT28 and showed that it most likely originated in China around 2016 after the acquisition of several mutations, and COVID-19 may have promoted its expansion. Approximately one quarter of MR-MT28 strains has evolved into predicted PRN-deficient strains. Our results showed the domestic spread and colonization of MR-MT28.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study provides evidence that pathogen evolution, rather than the widely accepted notion of wanning immunity or  immunity debt, is more likely the primary factor driving pertussis upsurge, age shift and vaccine escape. MR-MT28 potentially poses a high global spread risk, due to its consistent ptxP3 allele and epidemiology across many counties, together with resistance to first-line drugs and potentially competitive advantages, which warrants global surveillance and research efforts. Macrolides may no longer be suitable as first-line drugs for pertussis treatment in China.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

Recently, the emergence and dominance of the JN.1 lineage over XBB variants have prompted a reevaluation of current vaccine strategies. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of XBB-based vaccines against JN.1, concerns persist regarding the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses against evolving JN.1 subvariants. In this study, we compared the humoral immunogenicity of XBB and JN.1 lineage infections in human subjects with diverse immune histories to understand the antigenic and immunogenic distinctions between these variants. Similar to observations in naive mice, priming with XBB and JN.1 in humans without prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure results in distinct NAb responses, exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity. Importantly, breakthrough infections (BTI) with the JN.1 lineage induce 5.9-fold higher neutralization titers against JN.1 compared to those induced by XBB BTI. We also observed notable immune evasion of recently emerged JN.1 sublineages, including JN.1+R346T+F456L, with KP.3 showing the most pronounced decrease in neutralization titers by both XBB and JN.1 BTI sera. These results underscore the challenge posed by the continuously evolving SARS-CoV-2 JN.1 and support the consideration of switching the focus of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine updates to the JN.1 lineage.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Here, we introduce the CRISPR-Enabled Autonomous Transposable Element (CREATE), a genome editing system that combines the programmability and precision of CRISPR/Cas9 with the RNA-mediated gene insertion capabilities of the human LINE1 (L1) element. CREATE employs a modified L1 mRNA to carry a payload gene, and a Cas9 nickase to facilitate targeted editing by L1-mediated reverse transcription and integration without relying on DSBs or DNA templates. Using the system, a 1.1 kb gene cassette comprising an EF1 promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene is inserted into several genomic loci of multiple human cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that the CREATE system is highly specific with no observed off-target events. Together, these findings establish CREATE as a programmable gene delivery technology solely based on RNA components, enabling large-scale in vivo genome engineering with broad therapeutic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

DesignNationwide cohort studies, using target trial emulation.

SettingDenmark, Finland, and Sweden, from 1 October 2023 to 29 February 2024.

ParticipantsIndividuals aged [&ge;]65 years who had previously received at least four covid-19 vaccine doses. Main outcome measures: Cumulative incidences of covid-19 hospital admission and death for 12 weeks after immunisation (defined as 1 week after vaccination) among recipients of an XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine and matched non-recipients. Cumulative incidences were used to calculate comparative vaccine effectiveness (1-risk ratio) and risk differences.

ResultsDuring autumn and winter 2023-2024, a total of 1,867,448 1:1 matched pairs of XBB-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and non-recipients were included (mean age 75.4 years, standard deviation 7.4 years). The comparative vaccine effectiveness was 60.6% (95% confidence interval, 46.1% to 75.1%) against covid-19 hospital admission (930 v 2,551 events) and 77.9% (69.2% to 86.7%) against covid-19 related death (301 v 1,326 events) at 12 weeks of follow-up. This corresponded to 191.1 (95% confidence interval, 50.2 to 332.1) covid-19 hospital admissions and 109.2 (100.2 to 118.1) deaths prevented per 100,000 individuals vaccinated with an XBB.1.5-containing vaccine. The comparative vaccine effectiveness was similar across sex, age (65-74/[&ge;]75 years), number of previous covid-19 vaccine doses received, and seasonal influenza vaccination co-administration subgroups and periods of either omicron XBB- or BA.2.86-sublineage dominance. While the protection was highest during the first weeks after vaccination, it was well-preserved at end of week 12 of follow-up.

ConclusionAmong adults aged [&ge;]65 years, vaccination with a monovalent XBB.1.5-containing covid-19 mRNA vaccine reduced the rates of covid-19 related hospital admission and death during autumn and winter 2023-2024 across three Nordic countries.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

Initial efforts of drug development take place in early phase trials (phase-I and -II), setting the direction for late-stage studies (phase-III and -IV). However, study samples in early phase trials typically fail to recruit Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, which might produce results which dont generalise to a broader population in later trials, and ultimately, clinical practice. Focusing on early phase clinical trials the present study (1) explored the barriers and incentives that determine participation of ethnic minorities in clinical research, and (2) proposes strategies that mitigate such barriers.

MethodsA systematic literature review explored barriers affecting participation rates from individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. An exploratory phase involved two online surveys (researchers and general population) and focus groups (general population) analysed using thematic analysis.

ResultsThe systematic review found little published evidence, with most studies undertaken in the USA and focused on specific clinical areas. The exploratory phase showed a discordance between researchers and general publics perspectives on both drivers and barriers to early phase trial participation.

DiscussionThese findings were synthesised into a Clinical Trials Participatory Framework, which contextualises reasons for reduced trial participation, while providing mechanisms/strategies to increase uptake among minority ethnic participants. This may guide researchers when implementing strategies to aid under-representation in their samples. Further research should evaluate the framework by actively implementing, testing, and iterating upon the strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1717193263253

Domestic dogs offer a compelling model as they demonstrate more phenotypic variation than any other vertebrate species. Dogs have been intensely selected for specific traits and abilities, directly or indirectly, over the past 15,000 years since their initial domestication from the gray wolf. Because olfaction plays a central role in critical tasks, such as the detection of drugs, diseases, and explosives, as well as human rescue, we compared relative olfactory capacity across dog breeds and assessed changes to the canine olfactory system resulting from domestication. We conducted a cross-disciplinary survey of olfactory anatomy, olfactory receptor (OR) gene variation, and OR gene expression in domestic dogs. Through comparisons to their closest wild canid relatives, the gray wolf and coyote, we show that domestic dogs might have lost functional OR genes commensurate with a documented reduction in nasal morphology during domestication. Critically, within domestic dogs alone, we found no genetic or morphological profile shared among functional or genealogical breed groupings, such as scent hounds, that might indicate evidence of any human-directed selection for enhanced olfaction. Instead, our results suggest that superior scent detection dogs likely owe their success to advantageous behavioral traits and training rather than an ""olfactory edge"" provided by morphology or genes.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024.

It forms a right-handed helical barrel consisting of 22 pairs of Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 subunits, with a diameter of 32 nm its wider end and 19 nm at its narrower end. Oligomerization is stabilized by the C-terminus, which forms two helical layers linked by a {beta}-strand, and coiled-coil domains that enable strong charge-charge inter-subunit interactions. Flotillin interacts with membranes at both ends; through its SPFH1 domains at the wide end and the C-terminus at the narrow end, facilitated by hydrophobic interactions and lipidation. The inward tilting of the SPFH domain, likely triggered by phosphorylation, suggests its role in membrane curvature induction, which could be connected to its proposed role in clathrin-independent endocytosis. The structure suggests a shared architecture across the family of SPFH proteins and will promote further research into Flotillins roles in cell biology.

Significance statementIt is well known that many biochemical processes in cells must occur in localized regions. There are many different ideas about how cells keep processes localized. In this study we demonstrate that Flotillin1 and Flotillin2 co-assemble to form a large, truncated cone shaped cage whose wide end is always attached to a membrane surface and whose narrow end is sometimes attached to a separate membrane. The entire wall of the cage is without holes and is likely impervious even to small molecules, forming a diffusion barrier that can connect membrane systems. The Flotillin cage is thus well suited to isolate biochemical processes. Through membrane attachment, it also alters local membrane curvature, which could influence endocytic and mechanosensory processes.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

However, this approach can produce variability in results, requires significant training, and is ergonomically unfavorable to the experimenter. To circumvent limitations in manual delivery of stimuli, we have created a device called the ARM (Automated Reproducible Mechano-stimulator). Built using a series of linear stages, cameras, and stimulus holders, the ARM is more accurate at hitting the desired target, delivers stimuli faster, and decreases variability in delivery of von Frey hair filaments. We demonstrate that the ARM can be combined with traditional measurements of pain behavior and automated machine-learning based pipelines. Importantly, the ARM enables remote testing of mice with experimenters outside the testing room. Using remote testing, we found that mice appeared to habituate more quickly when an experimenter was not present and experimenter presence leads to significant sex-dependent differences in withdrawal behavior. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of the ARM for neural circuit dissection of pain mechanisms, we combined the ARM with cellular-resolved microendoscopy in the amygdala, linking stimulus, behavior, and brain activity of amygdalar neurons that encode negative pain states. Taken together, the ARM improves speed, accuracy, and robustness of mechanical pain assays and can be combined with automated pain detection systems and brain recordings to map pain sensation and affect.","NA","biorxiv",1717193263253

Systematic review identified thirty-nine studies that suffered from one particular and serious form of bias called miscategorisation bias, whereby study participants who have been vaccinated are categorised as unvaccinated up to and until some arbitrarily defined time after vaccination occurred. Simulation demonstrates that this miscategorisation bias artificially boosts vaccine efficacy and infection rates even when a vaccine has zero or negative efficacy.
