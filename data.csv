Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Yet, they take over a year to complete, are prone to human error, and face challenges with reproducibility; limiting access to timely and reliable information. We developed otto-SR, an end-to-end agentic workflow using large language models (LLMs) to support and automate the SR workflow from initial search to analysis. We found that otto-SR outperformed traditional dual human workflows in SR screening (otto-SR: 96.7% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity; human: 81.7% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity) and data extraction (otto-SR: 93.1% accuracy; human: 79.7% accuracy). Using otto-SR, we reproduced and updated an entire issue of Cochrane reviews (n=12) in two days, representing approximately 12 work-years of traditional systematic review work. Across Cochrane reviews, otto-SR incorrectly excluded a median of 0 studies (IQR 0 to 0.25), and found a median of 2.0 (IQR 1 to 6.5) eligible studies likely missed by the original authors. Meta-analyses revealed that otto-SR generated newly statistically significant conclusions in 2 reviews and negated significance in 1 review. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously conduct and update systematic reviews with superhuman performance, laying the foundation for automated, scalable, and reliable evidence synthesis.","NA","medrxiv",1749938941080

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Here, we present a multidisciplinary study encompassing structural, biochemical, and cellular approaches to elucidate Siglec-10-carbohydrate interactions and function. X-ray crystallography revealed two key arginine residues within the Siglec-10 binding site that interact with the carboxyl group of sialic acid, a canonical R119 and a non-canonical R127, suggesting potential dual contributions to ligand engagement. Saturation Transfer Difference (STD)-NMR confirmed that R119 is essential for binding to sialoglycans, while R127 appears dispensable in interactions with glycans in solution. However, cell-based binding assays using primary human T cells and engineered monocytic lines demonstrated that both arginines (R119 and R127) are critical for cellular recognition, highlighting a more complex mechanism of interaction with the glycocalyx. We further ruled out CD24 as a principal ligand for Siglec-10 on T cells or breast cancer cells, despite high CD24 expression, suggesting the involvement of alternative sialylated glycoproteins or glycolipids. Finally, we show that antibody-mediated blockade of Siglec-10 using S10A mAb restores CAR-T cell cytotoxicity against Siglec-10-expressing target cells, supporting a role for Siglec-10 as an immune checkpoint. These findings identify Siglec-10 as a modulatory receptor with structural and functional features distinct from other Siglec family members and provide a framework for therapeutic targeting in cancer immunotherapy.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein. However, the supercomplex structure and the role of the ring-like Csn2 protein remain unknown. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the type II-A prespacer selection supercomplex in the DNA-scanning and two different PAM-bound configurations. Our study uncovers the mechanism of Cas9-mediated prespacer selection in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems, and reveals the role of the accessory protein Csn2, which serves as a platform for the assembly of Cas9 and Cas1-Cas2 integrase on prespacer DNA, reminiscent of the sliding clamp in DNA replication. Repurposing of Cas9 by the CRISPR adaptation machinery for prespacer selection characterized here demonstrates Cas9 plasticity and expands our knowledge of the Cas9 biology.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpp's contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

TMED127/Methylaecorales showed a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea. Several other highly transcribed genes of unknown function had no homologs outside of TMED127/Methylaecorales genomes.

TMED127/Methylaecorales likely require methanol as a carbon and energy source, and display a diel pattern of transcription of key genes for methylotrophy that peaks in the late afternoon. These findings motivate future studies on the mechanisms of methanol production in surface seawater.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

However, there is a population of TB patients who require longer treatment durations. Prospectively identifying those who require shorter versus longer treatment durations would support evaluation and implementation of optimized regimens.

MethodsWe analysed data from the RIFASHORT TB treatment-shortening non-inferiority trial to define a TB phenotype classification. The RIFASHORT trial primary outcome was reanalysed using the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion of eight percentage points, stratifying by those classified as having limited or extensive disease.

ResultsXpert MTB/RIF(R) semiquantitative bacterial burden in combination with TB disease involvement grading on chest X-ray achieved the strongest differentiation between relapse and non-relapse. The extensive disease TB phenotype (high semiquantitative bacterial burden and extensive TB disease on X-ray) accounted for one quarter of the RIFASHORT trial population and more than half of all post-treatment TB relapses (13/23). For the limited TB disease phenotype (<high semiquantitative bacterial burden or no extensive TB disease on X-ray), the experimental 4-month 1200mg rifampicin-containing regimen met the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion in both modified-intention-to-treat (adjusted risk difference: -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -6.7% to 4.0%)) and per protocol analyses (1.7% (95% CI: -3.8% to 7.1%)).

ConclusionA four-month treatment duration, with a widely available, tolerable, rifampicin-based TB treatment regimen, was non-inferior to the standard of care for three-quarters of people with TB in the RIFASHORT trial. This finding justifies definitive evaluation of disease-stratified rifampicin-based TB treatment in a phase III randomised trial.

summaryXpert MTB/RIF(R) and chest radiography at TB treatment initiation identify a majority of patients for whom a 4-month treatment duration is non-inferior to the standard of care. These widely available measures may facilitate personalised TB treatment durations.","NA","medrxiv",1749938941080

However, the mechanism by which LAMV is attenuated is not well understood, contributing to the increased vaccine hesitancy that has caused a worldwide resurgence of measles. Here, we provide a molecular model of attenuation that implicates increased host innate immune responses and increased LAMV susceptibility to those responses. Our study leverages both in vitro and in vivo models of infection to find that acute induction of innate immunity in immune cells is the critical determinant of LAMV attenuation. We show that LAMV, in contrast to pathogenic wild type measles virus (MeV), causes a strong IFN response in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which restricts viral replication and spread in a post-entry manner. LAMV can enter, transcribe viral mRNA and translate viral proteins in immune cells, but is not able to form infectious particles and spread from cell to cell. Specifically, we find that mutations conserved across LAMV strains in the P/V/C and H genes are responsible for the induction of IFN and the restriction of infectious virus production. In PBMC cultures and in rhesus macaques, LAMV infection also results in the acute induction of proinflammatory cytokines that likely play a role in the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Overall, our study provides a virological and immunological framework for LAMV attenuation which can be leveraged in repurposing the LAMV backbone and in future vaccine design.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

To explore the role of CD4+ T cells in vaccine-dependent tumor rejection, we constructed an mRNA lipoplex vaccine encoding a single MHCII-restricted neoantigen. The vaccine elicited Tfh and Th1 cell responses while decreasing Tregs, leading to rejection of established tumors in mice. IL-21 and IFN-{gamma}, crucial for Tfh and Th1 function respectively, contributed to anti-tumor activity. B cells and neoantigen-specific antibodies were also shown to participate in vaccine efficacy. Additionally, conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) were essential for eliciting vaccine-induced CD4+ T cells, and both cDC1s and CD4+ T cells were required to enhance endogenous CD8+ responses, which were crucial for tumor control. Our results suggest that immunizing against MHCII neoantigens alone is sufficient to orchestrate a potent and cooperative immune response against cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

However, the nature of these computations remains unclear. Current models disagree on two fundamental questions: what stopping-rule is applied to post-choice evidence sampling and to what degree do choice and confidence reports rely on shared versus distinct evidence accumulation processes? These models have proven difficult to dissociate because they often make similar behavioural predictions. Therefore, we used a neurally-informed modelling approach to jointly model initial choices and subsequent confidence reports while leveraging the additional constraints offered by human electrophysiological signatures of evidence accumulation. Participants made self-paced confidence reports after indicating perceptual choices on a random dot motion task, with stimulus presentation continuing during the interval between these responses. Model comparison showed that boundary-based stopping rules provided superior fits to the behavioural data than time-based stopping rules, as the latter could not account for relationships between confidence and confidence-RT. The behavioural fits were inconclusive when comparing models with a single evidence accumulation process dictating choices and confidence reports compared to models invoking a distinct post-choice process. However, the single-process model markedly outperformed the other models in terms of its ability to recapitulate the observed neural evidence accumulation patterns associated with choice confidence. Our study thus demonstrates that choice behaviour, subjective confidence, and associated neural decision signals can be jointly explained by a model invoking a single process of evidence accumulation with separate boundaries for the initial choice and subsequent confidence reports.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

However, to characterize of the pleiotropic, molecular and population genetic bounds of uncovered loci, investigations are conducted, that remain conceptually and practically separated. Also in the best case, such investigations proceed by one locus at a time. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for executing haplotype-based association analysis on GWAS-identified genetic loci, which is especially helpful in samples enriched with molecular omics data. Haplomics takes as input the genetic coordinates of each locus along with all available clinical and molecular phenotypes, the necessary covariates, and VCF genotype files, to reconstruct haplotypes and test them for associations with the phenotypes. The reconstructed haplotypes, the annotation of included variants, and association results are graphically displayed in an HTML report. We tested Haplomics in population-based study sample encompassing 391 traits, including 72 clinical markers, 171 serum metabolites, 148 plasma protein concentrations, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) imputed genotypes. We estimated WES-based haplotypes at 11 kidney function genetic loci from a GWAS and conducted association analyses throughout, identifying 19 significant associations after multiple testing correction. Haplomics is a scalable, easy-to-use and fast haplotype reconstruction and association pipeline that makes it possible to jointly conduct molecular and population-genetic characterization of multiple GWAS loci in unified analysis framework.

Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC.

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations.
C_LIO_LINBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory. Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics.

This provides strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of sensory entrainment in reversing autism-related cognitive deficits.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

There is no biochemical process that can directly oxidize ammonium into nitrogen gas using nitrate under anaerobic conditions. In this study, mature anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) granular sludge was inoculated in an anaerobic nitrogen-removal system, while nitrate and ammonium were used as the influent substrates. The experiment was conducted for 537 days at a temperature of 30-32; and a pH of 8.0-9.0. The transformation from nitrite-anammox to nitrate-anammox was stably achieved on the 350th day. The experimental results showed that, nitrate directly oxidized ammonium into nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions. The produced gas consisted of 96.3% nitrogen and 3.7% carbon dioxide. The removal ratio of ammonium to nitrate was approximately 1.67:1, and the total inorganic nitrogen removal rate reached up to 290.20 mg/(L{middle dot}d). Unlike the nitrite-anammox reaction, this reaction was accompanied by an acid production process, which caused a decrease in pH. When the substrate was changed to nitrite and ammonium, the total nitrogen removal rate of only 1.1-1.3 mg/(L{middle dot}d) was achieved. This new biochemical reaction of nitrogen was defined as nitrate-anammox. The study reveals a new pathway of nitrogen transformation, providing novel insights into the global nitrogen cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

To tease apart global processing from local interactions, we applied a novel statistical approach called pCCA-FA (a combination of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis and factor analysis) to analyze trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses. We found substantial shared variability among neurons within each population, much of which was actually shared across populations and linked to an arousal process.

The N-terminal helix 0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor, the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix 0 in the presence of EPL membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: binding of the N-terminal helix 0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix 0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix/membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends.

The emergence of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification, we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) -- a method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting its validity.

NTAC comes in two flavors: a semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that achieves over 95% accuracy on the flys visual system starting with just 2% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC. In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels.

Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning, and design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method achieves [~]70% accuracy on the flys visual system, drastically outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types.

Both variants of NTAC are evaluated on multiple state of the art connectomes including optic lobes, central brain and nerve cord of adult fruit flies.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles. We hypothesized that barrel cortex neurons inherit  stick responses from the VPM and  sweep responses from the POm. Here we test this hypothesis by studying the coding strategy of both thalamic nuclei and wS1 in mice. We found a stratified wS1 representation of both sweep and stick functional classes, whereas VPM and POm contained mainly stick encoding neurons. Cortical layer 4  stick responses are a delayed version from VPM, while layer 5b  sweep responses come from POm. Notably, layer 5a  sweep responses result from a temporal integration of  stick information from VPM and POm.

The characterised mini-bacterioferritin was isolated from a microbial enrichment dominated by the methanotrophic archaeon  Candidatus Methanoperedens BLZ2. Its atomic resolution crystal structure reveals a 12-mer assembly with a diiron ferroxidase centre located within a four-helix bundle. Redox cycling experiments on protein crystals reveal a shift in iron position at the active site, which follows the established ferritin catalytic cycle. The 12-mer sphere-like structure harboured six Fe-coproporphyrin III ligands, positioned at the interdimeric interface, a characteristic previously only found in 24-mer bacterioferritins. Phylogenetics, together with structure predictions of closely related proteins, revealed that mini-bacterioferritins form a new clade within the ferritin family that might conserve ancestral traits. Future research will need to investigate the physiological roles of these enzymes, which were unsuspectingly widely distributed among prokaryotes.

We investigated early metabolic markers of non-survival, and a potential microbial intervention using Bacteroides intestinalis-AM1, to improve outcomes in ALF.

MethodPlasma metabolomics and meta-proteomics were performed in 40 ALF patients and 5 healthy controls (training cohort). A non-survival marker panel was identified and validated in 270 ALF patients (test cohort) using high resolution mass spectrometry and machine learning. It was functionally validated in acetaminophen-induced ALF mouse model. B. intestinalis-AM1 was used to study alteration of gut bacteria and amelioration of liver injury.

ResultsALF non-survivors showed a distinct metabolomic signature with elevated primary bile acids {chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), cholic acid (CA)}, tryptophan, tyrosine, and enrichment of pathways linked to inflammation, cell death, and stress response (p<0.01, FDR<0.01, FC>1.5). Non-survivors had higher alpha/beta diversity (p<0.05) with increase in Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria (p<0.05); functionally associated with energy, amino acid and xenobiotic metabolism (p<0.05). A gut microbiota derangement in converting primary to secondary bile acids was evident as CDCA and cytotoxic metabolites (4-(2-Amino phenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoate, L-Tyrosine) were higher. Elevated CDCA (logFC>10) levels correlated with mortality in ALF patients as well as in mouse model. In the later, administration of B. intestinalis-AM1 bacteria, (10^9) reduced CDCA and CA levels by enhancing FXR, FGF15, SLC10A1 gene expression, attenuating inflammation (IL-1beta, TLR4-signalling), necroptosis, and modulating glutathione(oxidative-repair), tryptophan(inflammation), and histidine (tissue repair) metabolism.

ConclusionHigh levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) represent a poor prognostic indicator in ALF patients. B. intestinalis-AM1, a primary-to-secondary bile acid converter, effectively reduce CDCA levels, activated FXR, reduced inflammation and protected hepatocytes, highlighting its therapeutic potential in ALF.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Although theoretical models suggest that such divergence is notably facilitated by small population size and genetic polymorphisms influencing reproductive timing, though constrained by genetic load, empirical validation remains limited. We investigated these predictions by re-analyzing a case of allochronic differentiation between two sympatric populations of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Portugal, using whole genome resequencing (IndSeq and PoolSeq) of those two populations and eight allopatric ones. We inferred the demographic history of those populations, assessed their genetic load, and searched for genomic regions associated with life cycle differences. Our analyses revealed a recent split between the sympatric allochronic populations, accompanied by a strong reduction in gene flow, bottlenecks, inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious variants. Genome scans identified several loci associated with life cycle variation, including genes putatively involved in circadian rhythm regulation. These loci were predominantly located on the Z chromosome, which overall exhibited a marked reduction in diversity in the population with the shifted phenology, likely caused by a bottleneck and an interruption of gene flow at the Z in this population. We discuss how these empirical genomic findings support theoretical expectations that assortative mating driven by differences in reproductive timing, underpinned by polymorphisms in circadian genes, along with genetic drift and purge of genetic load at high-impact sites, can promote the onset and persistence of allochronic divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Many studies have proposed methods for genome-wide association study (GWAS) in admixed populations and various simulation studies have evaluated their performances. In this work, we propose another direction of comparison of recently proposed methods for admixed GWAS from a population genetic viewpoint. Results: Our theoretical approach mathematically and directly compares the power of methods given that the causal variant is tested. This is done by deriving the variance formula of the methods from the population genetic admixture model. Our results analytically confirm previous observation that the standard GWAS test is more powerful than alternative tests due to leveraging allele frequency heterogeneity in which alternatives do not. As a by-product, we obtain a simple method to improve the power of multi-degrees-of-freedom tests only using summary statistics. We further investigate the problem when the causal variant is not directly known but is detected by tagging variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD). The analysis shows that a genetic segment from admixed genomes may exhibit distinct LD patterns from the single-continental counterpart of the same ancestry. Conclusions: While the classic admixture model is successful in predicting GWAS power, its popular extension in the literature falls short in explaining the LD patterns found in simulations and real data, warranting an improved model for LD in admixed genomes.","NA","medrxiv",1749938941080

GABA binds to the extracellular domain of GB1 to activate G proteins through GB2. Here we show that GABAB receptors can be activated by mechanical forces, such as traction force and shear stress, in a GABA-independent manner. This GABA-independent mechano-activation of GABAB receptor is mediated by a direct interaction between integrins and the extracellular domain of GB1, indicating that GABAB receptor and integrin form a novel type of mechano-transduction complex. Mechanistically, shear stress promotes the binding of integrin to GB1 and induces an allosteric re-arrangement of GABAB receptor transmembrane domains towards an active conformation, culminating in receptor activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that shear stress-induced GABAB receptor activation plays a crucial role in astrocyte remodeling. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized function of GABAB receptor in mechano-transduction, uncovering a novel ligand-independent activation mechanism for GPCRs.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Recent computational methods have aimed to more accurately model GRNs by estimating the hidden Transcription Factor Activity (TFA), from prior knowledge of TF target regulatory connections, encoded as an input directed graph, to relax the assumption that mRNA level of the regulator correlates with the protein activity of the regulator. However, the noise in the prior knowledge can adversely affect the estimated TFA levels and the quality of the downstream inferred GRNs. Here, we present a new approach, MERLIN+P+TFA, that uses prior knowledge-guided sparsity regularization to robustly and accurately estimate TFA and downstream GRNs. We apply our method to simulated and real expression data in yeast and mammalian systems and show improved quality of inferred GRNs for both bulk and single-cell datasets. Regularized TFA offers benefits to a variety of other GRN inference algorithms, including those that have traditionally be used with expression alone, in both bulk and scRNA-seq settings. We used the inferred GRN to prioritize key regulators for the mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) state and validate 58 regulators experimentally. We identify both known and novel regulators of the mESC state and further validate the targets of 4 known and novel regulators. Our validation experiments suggest that computationally inferred networks can capture functional targets of TFs with higher precision than estimated in current benchmarks, however, it is important to generate context-specific gold standards.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

However, the stoichiometric nature of such inhibitors and the emergence of resistance highlight the need for new modalities. Here, we report a Phosphorylation-Inducing Chimeric Small molecule (PHICS) that rewires the hyperactivity of an oncogenic kinase, BCR-ABL, to phosphorylate its active site residue. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest this phosphorylation inhibits BCR-ABL by inducing electrostatic rearrangements of its active site. This ''event-driven'' mechanism selectively induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-dependent cancer cells at substoichiometric concentrations (vs. stoichiometric concentrations of occupancy-driven drugs). Furthermore, PHICS is effective on other oncogenic ABL fusions or clinically observed resistance mutations, including to occupancy-driven drugs with the same binding site as PHICS, pointing to the orthogonality of their resistance mechanisms. These studies lay the foundation for electric-field and ''event-driven'' modalities to control hyperactive enzymes with orthogonal resistance mechanisms to occupancy-driven modalities.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum (Rps), a soil-borne plant pathogen that causes bacterial wilt disease, encodes a conserved LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) protein that mediates photoreception across the tree of life. However, Rps had a minimal LOV-dependent transcriptional response to light in culture. Clues from functional domains, the lov genomic neighborhood, and transcriptional analyses suggest that LOV shapes Rps biology in response to stress. Loss of LOV did not affect Rps biofilm or motility in vitro, but did influence expression of genes encoding for these phenotypes in planta. The{Delta} lov mutant had reduced heat tolerance and broad metabolic dysregulation, leading to growth defects on several carbon sources but a growth advantage in ex vivo tomato xylem sap and in high-iron medium. In vitro, the{Delta} lov mutant was more tolerant than wild type of redox stress and the antimicrobial phenolic caffeate, but Rps required lov for full virulence on tomato. LOV mediated attachment to the root surface, stem colonization, and overall symptom development. Together these findings reveal that LOV, which is highly conserved among plant pathogenic Ralstonia, modulates Rps stress response and virulence independently of light cues, but in a plant-dependent fashion.

ImportanceLike other plant-associated microbes, the destructive crop pathogen Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum (Rps) must integrate a complex array of biotic and abiotic signals to successfully infect and colonize the roots and xylem vessels of its plant hosts. Rps encodes a large LOV domain protein. LOV proteins sense blue light in leaf colonizing microbes, but Rps inhabits soil, plant roots, and xylem where there is little blue light. Although deleting lov had only minor effects when the bacterium grew in culture, many genes were dysregulated when the{Delta} lov mutant infected tomato plants. Functional experiments showed LOV has diverse light-independent roles in Rps, including modulating environmental stress tolerance and cellular iron and redox status. Most importantly, Rps needs LOV to grow normally in plants and cause bacterial wilt disease. Thus, LOV is a key sensor-regulator that controls Rps adaptation to the plant environment and virulence.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties. Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth. The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics. This approach will help to bridge the gap between connectomics, which emphasizes brain networks, and translational neuroscience, which often focuses on the unique roles of brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

However, the JK domain is not sufficient for IRES function, which also requires the preceding domain I of unknown function. To identify interactions that drive ribosomal recruitment of eIF4G/eIF4A-bound Type 2 IRESs, we determined the cryo-EM structure of 48S initiation complexes formed on the EMCV IRES. It revealed that the apical domain I cloverleaf contacts ribosomal proteins uS13 and uS19 via its Id subdomain and that the essential GNRA tetraloop in subdomain Ic interacts directly with the T{psi}C domain of initiator tRNA. Functional assays supported the exceptional role of these interactions for initiation on this IRES. The strong conservation of primary and secondary structures of the apex of domain I among Type 2 IRESs suggests that the reported interactions are a common essential feature of them all.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Their carriage often corresponds with changes to the host transcriptome, but it is unknown during which stage of the conjugation process these transcriptional changes are initiated, and how gene transfer is modulated as they occur. This is because they are normally studied after their full acquisition by conjugation has already occurred, not during the process. Here, active RP4 conjugation revealed that the transcriptional response to plasmid acquisition is almost immediate and is host and surface factor dependent. Responses included activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses were not a barrier to conjugation, indicating that their significance relates to host homeostasis rather than gene transfer. The recipient could prevent these responses by blocking conjugation through capsule expression. RP4 expression was also inhibited by recipient capsule, since capsule physically blocked donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, within a population, RP4 was found to exploit single cell variation in recipient capsule thickness and to successfully conjugate with recipient bacteria with reduced capsule. These results show a novel interplay between plasmid and surface architecture across diverse species that controls the conjugation transcriptional landscape, with important ramifications for plasmid dissemination and evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Here we show in human cells that the deubiquitinating enzyme ATXN3 helps restore integrity of the lysosomal system after damage by targeting K48-K63-linked branched ubiquitin chains on regenerating lysosomes. We find that ATXN3 translocates to lysosomes after different types of damage and there colocalizes with its partner, VCP/p97. ATXN3 recruitment occurs late after the initial repair of a subset of lysosomes and after phagophore formation on terminally damaged lysosomes. Of note, inactivation of ATXN3 by induced degradation, depletion or knock-out impairs clearance of damaged lysosomes and full restoration of lysosomal capacity. Mechanistically, ATXN3, along with VCP/p97, turns over K48-K63-branched ubiquitin conjugates on LAMP1-positive, phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate-decorated compartments that are not yet fully re-acidified indicating involvement in lysosome regeneration. Our findings identify a key role of ATXN3 in restoring lysosomal function after lysosomal membrane damage and uncover K48-K63-branched ubiquitin chain-regulated regeneration as a critical element of the lysosomal damage stress response.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Mutations in YIPF5 cause MEDS2 (microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes syndrome), a fatal disorder manifesting in early childhood. We demonstrate that YIPF5 is involved in ER export of a subset of proteins, including cargoes of the ER-export receptor SURF4, with which it directly interacts. In YIPF5 knockout cells, we observe a shift in the cell surface and secretome composition, marked by reduced neuronal adhesion molecules and increased secretion of ER chaperones influencing cell migration. YIPF5 depletion enhances cell migration in a wound-healing assay and alters SURF4 localization, causing elongated ERGIC53- and Rab1-positive tubules from COPII-labeled ER exit sites. Kinetic analysis suggests that YIPF5 negatively regulates SURF4-mediated ER export. In utero knockdown of Yipf5 in embryonic mouse brains induces premature neuronal migration and abnormal neuronal morphology. These findings suggest that YIPF5 and SURF4 coordinate ER export, and disruption may underlie cortical development defects leading to microcephaly.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Birth weight (BW) in pigs is associated with increased vitality and survival until weaning. However, as uniformity of BW increases, the importance of initial weight decreases as competition between piglets decreases. The aim of this study was to estimate the direct and maternal genetic components of BW, jointly with the maternal genetic component of the residual variance for within-litter BW, and their genetic correlations. We used two distinct datasets of Swiss Large White pigs: 1) the experimental farm dataset and 2) the commercial farms dataset, comprising 43,135 and 23,313 records of individual piglet birth weight, respectively. For statistical analysis, the heteroscedastic (or canalising selection) model was used. This model assumes that both the mean BW and the residual variance are affected by systematic and random effects, with the residual variance being heterogeneous and partially under genetic control. Despite the best fitting model was the most complex one including both genetic effects for the mean trait, the results indicated that direct genetic effects, or correlations with such effects, are negligible. The genetic environmental variance for BW ranged between 0.071 and 0.131 for experimental farm and 0.037 to 0.094. The genetic correlation between the mean BW and its variability was always positive and ranged between 0.149 and 0.307 for the experimental farm and between 0.220 and 0.589 for the commercial farms. It is thus sufficient to model BW and its variability by including only the maternal genetic effect for both traits. In addition, even though moderate genetic correlations exist between the mean and the variance of BW, focusing selection on BW uniformity within litters would be preferable to creating a selection index for both traits simultaneously.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1749938941080

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1749938941080

The vault cap features a positively charged exterior and a negatively charged interior surface, with implications for binding partner recruitment and putative binding of the vault particle to microtubules and lipid rafts. These findings uncover a new facet of vault particle architecture, and have implications for engineering and design of modified vault particles for therapeutic delivery, as well as providing new opportunities for interrogating the functional roles of the vault particle in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Xanthorhodopsins, with their dual chromophore system involving retinal and carotenoids, have been predominantly studied in the extreme halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber and in the primitive thylakoid-less cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus, where they facilitate light- driven outward proton pumping and enhanced light-harvesting. However, their distribution, binding specificity, and ecological significance in cyanobacteria remain poorly understood. Here we report widespread xanthorhodopsin genes in cyanobacterial genomes and characterize a protein from an Antarctic filamentous cyanobacterium that uniquely binds hydroxylated lutein. Through bioinformatics, spectroscopic, functional and structural assays analyses, we determine the properties and ecological role of this cyanobacterial xanthorhodopsin. Our findings highlight xanthorhodopsins role in modulating light-harvesting efficiency in cyanobacteria, particularly in extreme environments. The lutein binding and associated structural changes likely provide selective advantages for adapting to polar light conditions, contributing to cyanobacterial survival in harsh habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

In bacteria, diverse clades of repurposed TnpB and CRISPR-associated proteins repress gene expression by blocking transcription initiation or elongation, enabling non-canonical modes of regulatory control and adaptive immunity1,6,7. Intriguingly, a distinct class of nuclease-dead Cas12f homologs (dCas12f) instead activates gene expression through its association with unique extracytoplasmic function sigma factors ({sigma}E) 8, though the molecular basis has remained elusive. Here we reveal a novel mode of RNA-guided transcription initiation by determining cryo-electron microscopy structures of the dCas12f-{sigma}E system from Flagellimonas taeanensis. We captured multiple conformational and compositional states, including the DNA-bound dCas12f-{sigma}E-RNAP holoenzyme complex, revealing how RNA-guided DNA binding leads to {sigma}E-RNAP recruitment and nascent mRNA synthesis at a precisely defined distance downstream of the R-loop. Rather than following the classical paradigm of {sigma}E-dependent promoter recognition, these studies show that recognition of the -35 element is largely supplanted by CRISPR-Cas targeting, while the melted -10 element is stabilized through unusual stacking interactions rather than insertion into the typical recognition pocket. Collectively, this work provides high-resolution insights into an unexpected mechanism of RNA-guided transcription, expanding our understanding of bacterial gene regulation and opening new avenues for programmable transcriptional control.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941080

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake.

To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies.

To this end, JIP4, previously characterized as a motor adaptor and kinase signaling scaffold, suppresses TMEM55B-dependent ubiquitylation of CTNS. Loss of JIP4 reduces CTNS protein levels, leading to lysosomal cystine accumulation and lysosomal storage defects that phenocopy loss of CTNS in both human cells and the renal proximal tubules of JIP4 knockout mice. These phenotypes mirror cystinosis, the lysosomal storage disease caused by CTNS loss-of-function.

The dominant yeast Hanseniaspora uvarum varied dramatically in abundance (4.3-97.5%) and exhibited significant local adaptation and maladaptation patterns across orchard-variety combinations. Critically, H. uvarum local adaptation strongly predicted community composition: locally adapted populations achieved higher abundance while suppressing competitors. However, local adaptation had no effect on community-level performance in apple decomposition. Communities dominated by locally adapted H. uvarum performed equivalently to diverse assemblages, indicating functional redundancy among species.

The effects of OTR could be mediated by modulating the activity of pre-synaptic axon terminals or via post-synaptic neurons or glia. Using a viral-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), we selectively knocked down OTR in the anteromedial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to examine their roles modulating social approach and vigilance behaviors. Knockdown of OTR in the BNST attenuated stress-induced decreases of social approach and increases of social vigilance behaviors in adult female California mice, similar to prior pharmacological studies. These effects were more prominent in the large arena social interaction where mice could control proximity to a social target with a barrier (wire cage). In a small arena interaction test where focal mice freely interacted with target mice, effects of BNST OTR knockdown were muted. This suggests that within the BNST OTR are more important for modulating behavioral responses to more distal stimuli versus more proximal social contexts. In mice with OTR knockdown in the NAc, few behavioral changes were observed which is consistent with previous findings of the importance of presynaptic OTR, which were unaffected by our gene editing strategy, driving social approach behaviors in the NAc. Interestingly, BNST OTR knockdown increased exploratory behavior toward a non-social stimulus after stress, pointing to a potentially broader role for BNST OTR function. Our findings highlight the region- and context-specific functions of OTR in social behavior and the advantages of using a selective gene-editing tool to dissect the neural circuits that influence social and stress-related responses.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941081

Statistical genetics offers a hypothesis-free approach to this problem, as opposed to mechanistic models, which can be used only for reference isolates that are not representative of the whole species. In this study, we assembled two genomic and transcriptomic datasets for Escherichia coli (N=117) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=413) and identified associations between genetic variants in cis non-coding regions and recorded gene expression variation. We identified at least one associated variant in up to 39% of the tested genes in both species. We partly validated the associations in-silico and in-vitro for E. coli, reinforcing the difficulty of identifying a single mechanism generating gene expression diversity. We then investigated the relevance of non-coding variants in explaining the variability in antimicrobial resistance in both species using two additional publicly available datasets, identifying a large number of these variants across antimicrobial compounds.

Two hypomorphic microcephaly-associated alleles of ZNF335 failed to rescue nuclear condensate accumulation in ZNF335 KO cells, suggesting that aberrant condensates and impaired nuclear proteostasis may contribute to the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

Cyclic peptides offer greater stability and potential oral delivery, but their de novo design with computational methods as agonists is unproven. Here, we used the EvoBind AI platform to design cyclic peptide agonists for GCGR from sequence alone, without any structural templates or prior binding site information. EvoBind consistently identified the receptors activation surface, producing peptides that also activated GLP1R. Of three synthesised peptides, two showed potent dual activation of GCGR and GLP1R in cAMP assays, while all three activate GLP1R, with the 18-residue design achieving EC50 values of 32 nM (GLP1R) and 542 nM (GCGR), rivalling natural hormones. The designed sequences show no similarity to known agonists, and structural modelling indicates that they adopt novel binding modes compatible with active-state stabilisation. This is made possible by EvoBinds purely sequence-based, template-free approach, which enables the discovery of alternative solutions that are inaccessible to structure-guided methods. This study presents the first successful blind de novo design of a cyclic peptide agonist for a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), using only the receptor sequence as input. The findings highlight EvoBinds capacity to go beyond static binding, offering a generalisable strategy for therapeutic discovery through target-agnostic, sequence-driven peptide design.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941081

Each sense organ is composed of two glial cells, called the sheath and socket, and one or more neurons. A major challenge in studying their development has been the lack of methods to directly observe these structures in the embryo. Here, we mine a recently published high-resolution ultrastructural dataset of a comma-stage embryo that provides an untapped resource for visualizing early developmental events. From this dataset we reconstructed all head sense organs (two amphid (AM), four cephalic (CEP), six inner labial (IL), four outer labial quadrant (OLQ), and two outer labial lateral (OLL)). Symmetric sense organs were at different stages of morphogenesis, allowing us to infer developmental steps by which they form. First, we found that the sheath glial cell begins wrapping its partner neurons at the distal tip of the dendrites where it self-fuses into a seamless tube and then ""zippers"" down the dendrite. In many cases, sheath glia wrap the progenitors of partner neurons prior to their terminal division. After sheath wrapping has begun, the socket glia wraps the sheath glia circumferentially before presumably elongating to form the mature sheath-socket channel. We also observed transient interactions not found in the mature animal, such as amphid sheath glia wrapping the AUA neuron, that may reflect ancestral relationships. This study demonstrates the value of large public EM datasets that can be mined for new insights, and sheds light on how neurons and glia undergo coordinated morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941081

This broadband activity indicates spontaneous fluctuations in excitation-inhibition (E:I) balance across vigilance states and has recently been shown to systematically covary across the respiratory cycle during waking resting state. We used simultaneous EEG and respiratory recordings over a full night of sleep collected from N = 23 healthy participants to unravel the nested dynamics of respiration phase-locked excitability states across the wake-sleep cycle. We demonstrate a prominent phase shift in the coupling of aperiodic brain activity to respiratory rhythms as participants were transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. Moreover, respiration-brain coupling became more consistent both across and within participants, as interindividual as well as intraindividual variability systematically lessened from wakefulness and the transition to sleep towards deeper sleep stages. Our results suggest that respiration phase-locked changes in E:I balance conceivably add to sleep stage-specific neural signatures of REM and NREM sleep, highlighting the complexity of brain-body coupling during sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941081

In mammals, the menthol receptor, TRPM8, is activated by temperatures below [~]26{degrees}C and is essential for the perception of cold or chemical cooling agents 4-6. A fascinating, yet still unachieved goal is to elucidate structural mechanisms whereby TRPM8 or other thermosensitive channels are gated by changes in ambient temperature. Recent studies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have attempted to address this challenging question but are limited by difficulties in visualizing temperature-evoked conformational substates or assessing the energetic landscape governing gating transitions 7,8. Here, we close this gap by using cryo-EM to visualize TRPM8 channels in cellular membranes, where bona fide menthol- and cold-evoked open states are captured. We identify a novel  semi-swapped architecture in which interdigitation of channel subunits is substantially rearranged following repositioning of the S6 transmembrane helix and elements of the pore region. By combining this structural analysis with thermodynamic measurements using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), we are able to pinpoint the pore and TRP helices as key regions undergoing stimulus-evoked conformational dynamics that drive channel gating. Structural mechanisms associated with activation are validated by comparison of human TRPM8 with the menthol-sensitive, but relatively cold-insensitive avian orthologue. We propose a free energy landscape to explain channel gating by cold or cooling agents.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941081

BMP-dependent patterning of the secondary body axis is ancestral for Bilateria and possibly also for the bilaterian sister clade Cnidaria. However, the variety of levels of centralization of the nervous systems in Bilateria - from diffuse to fully centralized - as well as the lack of centralization of the nervous system in Cnidaria, suggest that BMP signaling cannot be perceived as a universally ""anti-neural"" signal. Here we use transgenic reporter lines in the anthozoan cnidarian Nematostella to show that BMP signaling is active in distinct neuronal populations. Moreover, attenuation of BMP signaling followed by RNA-Seq shows that BMP signaling is a positive regulator of many neuronal genes, including the top-tier neural progenitor marker soxB(2). Further, we analyze BMP signaling activity in the true jellyfish Aurelia and box jellyfish Tripedalia proving that BMP signaling in the diffuse cnidarian nervous system is not an anthozoan but an ancestral cnidarian feature, shared by anthozoans and medusozoans. Finally, we show that the highly centralized ventral nervous system of the non-model spiralian, the chaetognath Spadella, forms out of paired BMP signaling-positive domains on the lateral sides of the embryo. Together, our data suggest that one of the ancestral roles of BMP signaling was in promoting neurogenesis.

As LLMs now demonstrate expert-level diagnostic performance, the focus shifts from whether AI can offer valuable suggestions to how it can be effectively integrated into physicians diagnostic workflows. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n=70 clinicians) to evaluate the value of employing a custom GPT system designed to engage collaboratively with clinicians on diagnostic reasoning challenges. The collaborative design began with independent diagnostic assessments from both the clinician and the AI. These were then combined in an AI-generated synthesis that integrated the two perspectives, highlighting points of agreement and disagreement and offering commentary on each. We evaluated two workflow variants: one where the AI provided an initial opinion (AI-first), and another where it followed the clinicians assessment (AI-second). Clinicians using either collaborative workflow outperformed those using traditional tools, achieving average accuracies of 85% (AI-first) and 82% (AI-second), compared to 75% with traditional resources (p < 0.0004 and p < 0.00001; mean differences = 9.8% and 6.8%; 95% CI = 4.6%-15% and 4.0%-9.6%).

Phenotype-based discovery in ST data holds transformative potential for linking spatial molecular expression patterns to clinical outcomes; however, appropriate ST data analysis remains fundamentally fragmented and highly labor-intensive. Due to its limited scalability considering the size of typical ST data in large cohorts, researchers must rely on other phenotypeannotated omics data modalities (e.g. bulk RNAsequencing) and align them with ST data to extract clinically meaningful spatial patterns. Yet, this process requires manually identifying relevant cohorts, aligning multi-modal data, selecting and tuning analysis pipelines, and interpreting results--typically without any built-in support for biologically context-aware reasoning. In this paper, we present PhenoGraph, a large language model (LLM) based multi-agent system, that automates the full pipeline for phenotype-driven ST data analysis, augmented by biological knowledge graphs for enhanced interpretability. Built on a modular agent architecture, PhenoGraph dynamically selects, executes, and corrects phenotype analysis pipelines based on user-defined queries.

While there are hundreds of diverse GPCRs, only two {beta}-arrestin isoforms ({beta}arrs) must recognize and engage this wide range of receptors with varied phosphorylation patterns. Traditional models suggest that {beta}arr activation requires displacement of its autoinhibitory C-tail by a phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus; however, this paradigm fails to explain how minimally phosphorylated GPCRs still complex with {beta}arrs. Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer imaging and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we observe basal dynamics in which the {beta}arr1 C-tail spontaneously releases from the N-domain, transiently adopting an active conformation that can facilitate binding of the phosphorylated GPCR C-terminus. We further demonstrate the importance of an intermediate state of {beta}arr1 arising from spontaneous C-tail release stabilized by the membrane phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2. Both PI(4,5)P2 and mutations in the proximal or middle regions of the C-tail shift {beta}arr1 towards a partially released state, revealing an allosteric connection that informs a refined model for {beta}arr activation. In this model, membrane engagement conformationally primes {beta}arrs prior to receptor binding, thereby explaining how {beta}arrs are recruited by diverse GPCRs, even those with limited C-terminal phosphorylation.","NA","biorxiv",1749938941081

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.
