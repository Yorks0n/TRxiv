We investigated the pandemics impact on brain ageing using longitudinal neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank. Brain age prediction models were trained from hundreds of multi-modal imaging features using a cohort of 15,334 healthy participants. These models were applied to an independent cohort of 1,336 participants with two MRI scans: either both before the pandemic (Controls) or one before and one after the pandemic onset (""Pandemic"" group). Our findings reveal that, even with matched brain age gaps initially, the pandemic significantly accelerated brain ageing. The ""Pandemic"" group showed on average 11-month higher deviation of predicted brain age vs. chronological age (brain age gap) at the second time point compared with controls. Accelerated brain ageing was more pronounced in males and those from deprived socio-demographic backgrounds, with average increases of 3.3 and 7 months, respectively. These deviations existed regardless of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, accelerated brain ageing correlated with reduced cognitive performance only in COVID-infected participants. Our study highlights the pandemics significant impact on brain health, beyond direct infection effects, emphasising the need to consider broader social and health inequalities.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

While many neural circuits underlying feeding and parenting behaviors are well characterized, it is unclear how these different circuits interact and adapt during lactation. Here, we characterized the transcriptomic changes in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the medial preoptic area (MPOA) of the mouse hypothalamus in response to lactation and hunger. Furthermore, we showed that heightened appetite in lactating mice was accompanied by increased activity of hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the ARC. To assess the strength of hunger versus maternal drives, we designed a conflict assay where female mice chose between a food source or a chamber containing pups and nesting material. Although food-deprived lactating mothers prioritized parenting over feeding, hunger reduced the duration and disrupted the sequences of parenting behaviors in both lactating and virgin females. We discovered that ARCAgRP neurons directly inhibit bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) neurons in the MPOA, a population that governs both parenting and satiety. Selective activation of this ARCAgRP to MPOABRS3 circuit shifted behaviors from parenting to food-seeking. Thus, hypothalamic networks are modulated by physiological states and work antagonistically during the prioritization of competing motivated behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war (Physalia) is uniquely suited to dispersal, sailing the ocean surface with a muscular crest. We tested the hypothesis of a single, panmictic Physalia population by sequencing 133 genomes, and found five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence showing strong reproductive isolation despite range overlap. We then scored thousands of citizen-science photos and identified four recognizable morphologies linked to these lineages. Within lineages, we detected regionally endemic subpopulations, connected by winds and currents, and identified individual long-distance dispersal events. We find that, even in these sailing species, genetic variation is highly partitioned geographically across the open ocean.

SummaryThe open ocean is a vast and highly connected environment. The organisms that live there have a significant capacity for dispersal and few geographic boundaries to separate populations. Of these, the Portuguese man-o-war or bluebottle (genus Physalia) is uniquely suited to long-distance travel, using its gas-filled float and muscular crest to catch the wind and sail the sea surface. Physalia are distributed across the globe, and like many pelagic organisms, have been hypothesized to represent a massive, well-mixed population that extends across ocean basins. We tested this hypothesis by sequencing whole genomes of 133 samples collected from waters of over a dozen countries around the globe. Our results revealed five distinct lineages, with multiple lines of evidence indicating strong reproductive isolation, despite regions of range overlap. We combined these data with an independent dataset of thousands of images of Physalia uploaded to the citizen-science website inaturalist.org, which we scored for morphological characters including sail size, tentacle arrangement, and color. From these images, we identified four recognizable morphologies, described their geographical distribution, and linked them to four of the lineages identified with genomic data. We conclude there are at least four species, three of which correspond to species proposed by scientists in the 18th and 19th centuries: P. physalis, P utriculus, and P. megalista, along with one as yet unnamed species Physalia sp. from the Tasman Sea. Within each species, we observe significant population structure, with evidence of persistent subpopulations at a regional scale, as well as evidence for individual long-distance dispersal events. Our findings indicate that, instead of one well-mixed, cosmopolitan species, there are in fact multiple Physalia species with distinct but overlapping ranges, each made up of regionally endemic subpopulations that are connected by major ocean currents and wind patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Recently, Holst et al. demonstrated with their program Helixer that the accuracy of ab initio eukaryotic gene prediction can be improved by combining deep learning layers with a separate HMM postprocessor. We present Tiberius, a novel deep learning-based ab initio gene predictor that end-to-end integrates convolutional and long short-term memory layers with a differentiable HMM layer. Tiberius uses a custom gene prediction loss and was trained for prediction in mammalian genomes and evaluated on human and two other genomes. It significantly outperforms existing ab initio methods, achieving F1-scores of 62% at gene level for the human genome, compared to 21% for the next best ab initio method. In de novo mode, Tiberius predicts the exon-intron structure of two out of three human genes without error. Remarkably, even Tiberius's ab initio accuracy matches that of BRAKER3, which uses RNA-seq data and a protein database. Tiberius's highly parallelized model is the fastest state-of-the-art gene prediction method, processing the human genome in under 2 hours.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Previous archaeogenetic research identified the newcomers as migrants from the Eurasian steppe. However, genome-wide ancient DNA from putative source populations has not been available to test alternative theories of their precise source. We generated genome-wide ancient DNA data for 131 individuals from candidate archaeological contexts in the Circum-Uralic region in present-day Russia. Our results tightly link the Magyars to people of the Early Medieval Karayakupovo archaeological horizon on both the European and Asian sides of the southern Urals. Our analyes show that ancestors of the people of the Karayakupovo archaeological horizon were established in the Southern Urals by the Iron Age and that their descendants persisted locally in the Volga-Kama region until at least the 14th century.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Biopsies were sent for immunohistochemical staining. Clinical data was collected. Duodenal, ileal, cecal, and sigmoid colon samples were stained for SARS-CoV-2 using a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody. Slides were reviewed by a blinded pathologist. 8 patients with known duodenal SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (SC-NA) positivity and 8 demographically matched IBS matched patients from prior to 2020 were identified for RNA sequencing comparison. Results were compared with public data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository for intestinal tissue with IBS and epithelial tissues with active SARS-CoV2 infection. Results Of 30 patients, fifteen (50%) were identified to have positive SC-NA . 3 (20%) had received at least a single SARS-CoV2 vaccine in the + cohort, and 8 (53.3%) in the - (P=0.05). Primary symptoms were pain (86%, nausea (66.6%), and weight loss (60%). 37.5% of patients with colonic SC-NA displayed hematochezia. 33% of + patients showed elevated ESR/CRP. Mean + calprotectin was 317.3 vs. 156.4 (p=0.2). 11/15 (73.3%) +SC-NA had large lymphoid aggregates (LLA) (p = 0.00338). RNA expression was consistent with known acute SARS-CoV2 infection.

However, the mechanisms causing adipocyte inflammation and insulin resistance remain unclear. Here, we show that excess cholesterol induces adipocyte dysfunction, which is suppressed by the transcription factor Nfe2l1 (nuclear factor erythroid derived-2, like-1). Nfe2l1 is required to sustain proteasome function in adipocytes and proteotoxic stress induces adipocyte inflammation via the activation of Atf3. In humans, the Nfe2l1-proteasome pathway is inversely correlated to body mass index (BMI) in an adipose-depot specific manner. In mice, loss of adipocyte Nfe2l1 caused AT inflammation with a pronounced infiltration of macrophages and T cells. Mice lacking adipocyte Nfe2l1 displayed severe adipocyte dysfunction during diet-induced obesity (DIO), characterized by lower adipokine levels, steatosis, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Nfe2l1{triangleup}AT mice on an Apoe-deficient (Apoe KO) background fed a cholesterol-rich Western Diet (WD), developed a lipoatrophy-like syndrome, dyslipidemia, and enhanced atherosclerosis. Our results reveal an important role for proteasome-mediated proteostasis in adipocytes and indicate that Nfe2l1 is linked to metabolic health in humans and preclinical mouse models. Promoting proteostasis in adipocytes may thus alleviate inflammation in obesity, potentially averting adverse cardiometabolic outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

We sampled 190 individuals including juvenile and mature trees belonging to 18 temperate broadleaved tree species and 9 genera. We measured guard cell length (GCL), stomatal density (SD), specific leaf area (SLA), gas-exchange, iWUE and leaf {delta}13C as a proxy for long-term WUE. Leaf {delta}13C correlated positively with iWUE for both juvenile and mature trees. Across species, GCL showed a negative and SD a positive effect on iWUE and leaf {delta}13C of both juvenile and mature trees. Within species, however, only GCL was significantly associated with iWUE and leaf {delta}13C. Pioneer species (Populus, Prunus, Betula) showed a significantly lower leaf {delta}13C than climax forest species (Fagus, Quercus, Tilia), but the differentiation was not clear for iWUE.

To explore the mechanism of TC-NER, we recapitulated this reaction in vitro. When a plasmid containing a site-specific lesion is transcribed in frog egg extract, error-free repair is observed that depends on CSB, CRL4CSA, UVSSA, and ELOF1. Repair also depends on STK19, a factor previously implicated in transcription recovery after UV exposure. A 1.9 [A] cryo-electron microscopy structure shows that STK19 joins the TC-NER complex by binding CSA and the RPB1 subunit of Pol II. Furthermore, AlphaFold predicts that STK19 interacts with the XPD subunit of TFIIH, and disrupting this interface impairs cell-free repair. Molecular modeling suggests that STK19 positions TFIIH ahead of Pol II for lesion verification. In summary, our analysis of cell-free TC-NER suggests that STK19 couples RNA polymerase II stalling to downstream repair events.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

It is unknown, however, whether high-intensity interval training (HIIT) also evokes an epigenetic muscle memory. This study employed repeated training intervention interspersed with a detraining period to assess epigenetic memory of HIIT.

METHODSTwenty healthy subjects (25{+/-}5yrs) completed two HIIT interventions (training and retraining) lasting 2 months, separated by 3 months of detraining. Measurements at baseline, after training, detraining and retraining included maximal oxygen consumption ([V]O2max). Vastus lateralis biopsies were taken for genome-wide DNA methylation and targeted gene expression analyses. RESULTS: [V]O2max improved during training and retraining (p<0.001) without differences between interventions (p>0.58). Thousands of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) predominantly demonstrated a hypomethylated state after training, retained even after 3-months exercise cessation and into retraining. Five genes; ADAM19, INPP5a, MTHFD1L, CAPN2, SLC16A3 possessed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with retained hypomethylated memory profiles and increased gene expression. The retained hypomethylation during detraining was associated with an enhancement in expression of the same genes even after 3 months of detraining. SLC16A3, INPP5a, CAPN2 are involved in lactate transport and calcium signaling.

CONCLUSIONSDespite similar physiological adaptations between training and retraining, memory profiles were found at epigenetic and gene expression level, characterized by retained hypomethylation and increased gene expression after training into long-term detraining and retraining. These genes were associated with calcium signaling and lactate transport. Whilst significant memory was not observed in physiological parameters, our novel findings indicate that human skeletal muscle possesses an epigenetic memory of HIIT.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

In this view, the precise timing in the transcriptional activation of these genes may impact upon body length. Unlike other Hox clusters, HoxB lacks all posterior genes between Hoxb9 and Hoxb13, two genes separated by a ca. 70 kb large DNA segment containing an unusually high number of CTCF sites, suggesting it isolates Hoxb13 from the rest of the cluster, thereby delaying its negative impact on trunk extension. We deleted the spacer DNA to induce a potential heterochronic gain of function of Hoxb13 at physiological concentration and observed a shortening of the tail as well as other abnormal phenotypes, which were all rescued by inactivating Hoxb13 in-cis with the deletion. A comparable gain of function was observed in mutant ES cells grown as pseudo-embryos in vitro, which allowed us to examine in details the importance of both the number and the orientation of CTCF sites in the insulating activity of the DNA spacer. A short cassette containing all the CTCF sites was sufficient to insulate Hoxb13 from the rest of HoxB and additional modifications of this CTCF cassette showed that two CTCF sites in convergent orientations are already capable of importantly delaying Hoxb13 activation in these conditions. We discuss the relative importance of genomic distance versus number and orientation of CTCF sites in preventing Hoxb13 to be activated too early during trunk extension and hence to modulate tail length.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

During immobility, hippocampal replay sequences depict spatial paths related to the animals past experience or predicted future13. By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal place cells14 in combination with optogenetic manipulation of cortical input in freely behaving rats, we show here that the selection of hippocampal replay is governed by a novel self-avoidance principle. Following movement cessation, replay of the animals past path is strongly avoided, while replay of the future path predominates. Moreover, when the past and future paths overlap, early replays avoid both and depict entirely different trajectories. Further, replays avoid self-repetition, on a shorter timescale compared to the avoidance of previous behavioral trajectories. Eventually, several seconds into the stopping period, replay of the past trajectory dominates. This temporal organization contrasts with established and recent predictions9,10,15,16 but is well-recapitulated by a symmetry-breaking attractor model of sequence generation in which individual neurons adapt their firing rates over time26-35. However, while the model is sufficient to produce avoidance of recently traversed or reactivated paths, it requires an additional excitatory input into recently activated cells to produce the later window of past-dominance. We performed optogenetic perturbations to demonstrate that this input is provided by medial entorhinal cortex, revealing its role in maintaining a memory of past experience that biases hippocampal replay. Together, these data provide specific evidence for how hippocampal replays are generated.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

However, indirect protection from infection-acquired immunity and its comparative strength and durability to vaccine-derived indirect protection in the current epidemiologic context of high levels of vaccination, prior infection, and novel variants are not well characterized. Here, we show that both infection-acquired and vaccine-derived immunity independently yield indirect protection to close social contacts with key differences in their strength and waning. Analyzing anonymized data from a system-wide SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program of 177,319 residents across 35 California state prisons from December 2021 to December 2022, we find that vaccine-derived indirect protection against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection is strongest within three months post-vaccination [30% (95% confidence interval: 20-38%)], whereas infection-acquired immunity provides 39% (25-51%) indirect protection to roommates for 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with moderate indirect protection persisting for over one year. Variant-targeted vaccines (bivalent formulation including Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5) confer strong indirect protection for at least three months [51% (18-70%)]. These results have important implications for understanding the long-term transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and can guide vaccine policy and public health measures, especially in high-risk environments such as prisons.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic neurons. These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP) and manipulate (opto- or chemo-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species.

Understanding how behavioral and artifactual variation in these populations relates to climate change and ecology is vital to correctly interpreting the archaeological record, especially given the major climatic and cultural fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Bifacially flaked core tools - which technologically define the tradition - are sometimes regionally and periodically absent within the Acheuleans boundaries. Biface presence is broadly associated with, but rarely formally tested against, environmental conditions. Here, we investigate biface presence/absence and climate/ecological variation at a continental scale between 726 and 130ka. Using a comprehensive sample of European sites matched to paleoenvironmental reconstructions, we demonstrate clear associations between Acheulean presence and specific environments. Acheulean habitat suitability was most strongly associated with mean winter temperatures above -5/-10{degrees}C, and precipitation of the driest month above 15 mm. Two major habitats, warm forest/woodland and shrubland, comprised the European Acheulean niche. Acheulean spatial presence was reconstructed through time: during interglacial and glacial periods it covered most of southwestern Europe, but extended along northern coastal routes during interglacials. Central and Eastern Europe always remained unsuitable. The Acheulean was excluded from areas experiencing both low winter temperatures and low summer precipitation, but reached areas including only one of those two climatic extremes, suggesting seasonal migrations to avoid the harshest seasons. These analyses explain current Acheulean site distributions in Europe and suggest strong links between handaxes, specific ecological conditions, and prehistoric demographic patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Critical to this function is the ability to transition between states of proliferation and quiescence. This balancing act is disrupted with age, leading to eroded regenerative capacity. Notwistanding, mechanisms by which the regenerating niche directs MuSCs return to the dormant state are largely unknown. Since single-cell RNAseq methods exclude the analysis of multinucleated cells, we generated single-nuclei RNAseq datasets of regenerating muscle to capture the full breadth of myogenic progression. With this, we uncovered new transition states between differentiating myocytes and syncytial multinucleated cells. Using cell communication inference tools, we highlighted receptor-ligand interactions between MuSCs and fusing nuclei. We leveraged a bespoke biomimetic 3D niche that induces MuSC quiescence, to filter the predicted interactions using a Cas9-based functional genomics approach. We found the proteoglycan Perlecan (Hspg2) promotes MuSC re-quiescence. Hspg2 silencing in vivo, during muscle regeneration, induced an aging-like phenotype and perturbed MuSC re-quiescence. Notably, the temporal profile and overall levels of Perlecan were altered with age. Exogenous supplementation with Endorepellin (truncated Perlecan) rescued MuSC decline following aged muscle regeneration, offering a new therapeutic target.

This has translational significance because a standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prolonged exposure therapy. However, few studies have investigated psilocybins potential effect in fear learning paradigms. More specifically, the extents to which dose, timing of administration, and serotonin receptors may influence psilocybins effect on fear extinction are not understood. In this study, we used an auditory delay fear conditioning paradigm to determine the effects of psilocybin on fear extinction, extinction retention, and fear renewal in male and female mice. Psilocybin robustly enhances fear extinction when given acutely prior to testing for all doses tested. Psilocybin exerts long-term effects to elevate extinction retention and suppress fear renewal in a novel context, though these changes were sensitive to dose. Administration of psilocybin prior to fear learning or immediately after extinction yielded no change in behavior, indicating that concurrent extinction experience is necessary for the drugs effects. Co-treatment with a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocked psilocybins effects for extinction, extinction retention and fear renewal, whereas 5-HT1A receptor antagonism attenuated only the effect on fear renewal. Collectively, these results highlight dose, context, and serotonin receptors as crucial factors in psilocybins ability to facilitate fear extinction. The study provides preclinical evidence to support investigating psilocybin as a pharmacological adjunct for extinction-based therapy for PTSD.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Safe and alternative therapeutic strategies are urgently needed1. A ketogenic diet has been shown to have anti-tumor effects across diverse cancer types but will unlikely have a significant effect alone. However, the diet shifts metabolism in tumors to create new vulnerabilities that can be targeted (1). Modulators of glutamine metabolism have shown promise in pre-clinical models but have failed to have a marked impact against cancer in the clinic. We show that a ketogenic diet increases TCA and glutamine-associated metabolites in murine pancreatic cancer models and under metabolic conditions that simulate a ketogenic diet in vitro. The metabolic shift leads to increased reliance on glutamine-mediated anaplerosis to compensate for low glucose abundance associated with a ketogenic diet. As a result, glutamine metabolism inhibitors, such as DON and CB839 in combination with a ketogenic diet had robust anti-cancer effects. These findings provide rationale to study the use of a ketogenic diet with glutamine targeted therapies in a clinical context.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at monthly online workshops. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biologically-relevant parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localisation in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together 31 researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants, and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. Looking ahead, our project provides a glimpse of what open, collaborative science could look like and provides a necessary, tentative step towards it.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) emerged as a promising recurrence predictor, detecting molecular residual disease (MRD). However, spatial information about the tumor and its microenvironment is not directly measured by ctDNA. Deep Learning (DL) can predict prognosis directly from routine histopathology slides. Methods: We developed a DL pipeline utilizing vision transformers to predict disease-free survival (DFS) based on histological hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) from patients with resectable stage II-IV CRC. This model was trained on the DACHS cohort (n=1766) and independently validated on the GALAXY cohort (n=1555). Patients were categorized into high- or low-risk groups based on the DL-prediction scores. In the GALAXY cohort, the DL-scores were combined with the four-weeks post-surgery MRD status measured by ctDNA for prognostic stratification. Results: In GALAXY, the DL-model categorized 307 patients as DL high-risk and 1248 patients as DL low-risk (p<0.001; HR 2.60, CI 95% 2.11-3.21). Combining the DL scores with the MRD status significantly stratified both the MRD-positive group into DL high-risk (n=81) and DL low-risk (n=160) (HR 1.58 (CI 95% 1.17-2.11; p=0.002) and the MRD-negative group into DL high-risk (n=226) and DL low-risk (n=1088) (HR 2.37 CI 95% 1.73-3.23; p<0.001). Moreover, MRD-negative patients had significantly longer DFS when predicted as DL high-risk and treated with ACT (HR 0.48, CI 95% 0.27-0.86; p= 0.01), compared to the MRD-negative patients predicted as DL low-risk (HR=1.14, CI 95% 0.8-1.63; p=0.48). Conclusion: DL-based spatial assessment of tumor histopathology slides significantly improves the risk stratification provided by MRD alone. Combining histologic information with ctDNA yields the most powerful predictor for disease recurrence to date, with the potential to improve follow-up, withhold adjuvant chemotherapy in low-risk patients and escalate adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk patients.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

Underlying this observation is the concept that the kinetochore is spatially linked with the pericentromere where sister-chromatids are most tightly cohered. Here, we found an unconventional pericentromere specification with sister chromatids mainly cohered at a chromosome end, spatially separated from the kinetochore in Peromyscus mouse oocytes. This distal locus enriched cohesin protectors, such as the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) and PP2A, at a higher level compared to its centromere/kinetochore region, acting as the primary site for sister-chromatid cohesion. Chromosomes with the distal cohesion site exhibited enhanced cohesin protection at anaphase I compared to those without it, implying that these distal cohesion sites may have evolved to ensure sister-chromatid cohesion during meiosis. In contrast, mitotic cells enriched CPC only near the kinetochore and the distal locus was not cohered between sister chromatids, suggesting a meiosis-specific mechanism to protect cohesin at this distal locus. We found that this distal locus corresponds to an additional centromeric satellite block, located far apart from the centromeric satellite block that builds the kinetochore. Several Peromyscus species carry chromosomes with two such centromeric satellite blocks. Analyses on three Peromyscus species revealed that the internal satellite consistently assembles the kinetochore in both mitosis and meiosis, whereas the distal satellite selectively enriches cohesin protectors in meiosis to promote sister-chromatid cohesion at that site. Thus, our study demonstrates that pericentromere specification is remarkably flexible and can control chromosome segregation in a cell-type and context dependent manner.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

De novo variants in cytoskeletal {beta}- and {gamma}-actin, encoded by human ACTB and ACTG1 genes, lead to a wide range of rare diseases, termed Non-Muscle Actinopathies (NMA). Variants include missense, frameshift, truncating variants up to whole gene deletions and induce diverse symptoms. So far, the high clinical variability and genotype-phenotype correlations in NMA remain largely unresolved. To address this question, we used CRISPR to insert in the C. elegans homologue act-2 gene nine de novo mutations identified in patients. Using these animal models, we performed a quantitative multiscale characterisation. We uncovered a variety of perturbations: actin network defects at the micro scale, cell scale abnormalities, morphogenesis failure, as well as weaker behavioural phenotypes. Importantly, the range of developmental defects observed correlates with the severity of patients symptoms. Thus, we provide evidence that a C. elegans- based approach represents a new way to investigate the mechanisms underlying NMA physiopathology or ultimately screen for therapeutic strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

It is well established that the phenotype of senescent cells is highly heterogeneous and influenced by their cell type and senescence-inducing stimulus. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies identified heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. However, proof of functional differences between such subpopulations is lacking. To identify functionally distinct senescent cell subpopulations, we employed high-content image analysis to measure senescence marker expression in primary human endothelial cells and fibroblasts. We found that G2-arrested senescent cells feature higher senescence marker expression than G1-arrested senescent cells. To investigate functional differences, we compared IL-6 secretion and response to ABT263 senolytic treatment in G1 and G2 senescent cells. We determined that G2-arrested senescent cells secrete more IL-6 and are more sensitive to ABT263 than G1-arrested cells. We hypothesize that cell cycle dependent DNA content is a key contributor to the heterogeneity within senescent cell populations. This study demonstrates the existence of functionally distinct senescent subpopulations even in culture. This data provides the first evidence of selective cell response to senolytic treatment among senescent cell subpopulations. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the senescent cell heterogeneity in the development of future senolytic therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

This bias introduces spurious associations between disease progression and genetic variants that are truly only associated with disease incidence. Methods of statistical adjustment to reduce this bias have been published, but rely on assumptions regarding the genetic correlation of disease incidence and disease progression which are likely to be violated in many human diseases.

MR-Horse is a recently published Bayesian method to estimate the parameters of a general model of genetic pleiotropy in the setting of Mendelian Randomisation. We adapted this method to provide bias-reduced GWAS estimates of associations with disease progression, robust to the genetic correlation of disease incidence and disease progression and robust to the presence of pleiotropic variants with effects on both incidence and progression.

We applied this adapted method to simulated GWAS of disease incidence and progression with pleiotropic variants and varying degrees of genetic correlation. When significant genetic correlation was present, the MR-Horse method produced less biased estimates than unadjusted analyses or analyses adjusted using other existing methods. Type 1 error rates with the MR-Horse method were consistently below the nominal 5% level, at the expense of a modest reduction in power. We then applied this method to summary statistics from the CKDGen consortium GWAS of kidney function decline. MR-Horse attenuated the effects of variants with known likely biased effects in the CKDGen GWAS, whilst preserving effects at loci with likely true effects.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Here we investigated the function of FGF in a stem cell model for human gastrulation known as a 2D gastruloid. We found a ring of FGF-dependent ERK activity that closely follows the emergence of primitive streak (PS)-like cells but expands further inward. We showed that this ERK activity pattern is required for PS-like differentiation and that loss of PS-like cells upon FGF receptor inhibition can be rescued by directly activating ERK. We further demonstrated that the ERK-ring depends on localized activation of basally localized FGF receptors (FGFR) by endogenous FGF gradients. We confirm and extend previous studies in analyzing expression of FGF pathway components, showing the main receptor to be FGFR1 and the key ligands FGF2/4/17, similar to the human and monkey embryo but different from the mouse. In situ hybridization and scRNA-seq revealed that FGF4 and FGF17 expression colocalize with the PS marker TBXT but only FGF17 is maintained in nascent mesoderm and endoderm. FGF4 and FGF17 reduction both reduced ERK activity and differentiation to PS-like cells and their derivatives, indicating overlapping function. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown role for FGF-dependent ERK signaling in 2D gastruloids and possibly the human embryo, driven by a mechanism where FGF4 and FGF17 signal through basally localized FGFR1 to induce PS-like cells.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

We discover over 100 unique RNA-regulatory effectors in 86 distinct RBPs, presenting evidence that RBPs contain functionally separable domains that dictate their post-transcriptional control of gene expression, and identify some with unique activity at 5 or 3UTRs.

Despite this general heterogeneity, several common factors have been identified. For example, nearly all patients show pathological accumulations of phosphorylated TDP-43 protein in affected regions of the motor cortex and spinal cord. Moreover, large patient cohort studies have revealed that most patient samples can be grouped into a small number of ALS subtypes, as defined by their transcriptomic profiles. These ALS molecular subtypes can be grouped by whether postmortem motor cortex samples display signatures of: mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (ALS-Ox), microglial activation and neuroinflammation (ALS-Glia), or dense TDP-43 pathology and associated transposable element de-silencing (ALS-TE). In this study, we have built a deep layer ALS neural network classifier (DANcer) that has learned to accurately assign patient samples to these ALS subtypes, and which can be run on either bulk or single-cell datasets. Upon applying this classifier to an expanded ALS patient cohort from the NYGC ALS Consortium, we show that ALS Molecular Subtypes are robust across clinical centers, with no new subtypes appearing in a cohort that has quadrupled in size. Signatures from two of these molecular subtypes strongly correlate with disease duration: ALS-TE signatures in cortex and ALS-Glia signatures in spinal cord, revealing molecular correlates of clinical features. Finally, we use single nucleus RNA sequencing to reveal the cell type-specific contributions to ALS subtype, as determined by our single-cell classifier (scDANCer). Single-cell transcriptomes reveal that ALS molecular subtypes are recapitulated in neurons and glia, with both ALS-wide shared alterations in each cell type as well as ALS subtype-specific alterations. In summary, ALS molecular subtypes: (1) are robust across large cohorts of sporadic and familial ALS patient samples, (2) represent a combination of cellular, genetic, and pathological features, and (3) correlate with clinical features of ALS.

In mice, iNKT1c cells showed potent CD1d-dependent and -independent antitumor functions, with responses influenced by NK receptors. IL-15 enhances their cytolytic activity, while retinoic acid is essential for their generation. In humans, terminally differentiated CD57+ iNKT cells showed marked NK-receptor expression and most effectively killed C1R tumor cells in vitro.

Although mis-regulation of RNA turnover is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, how it contributes to cortical development is largely unknown. Here, we profile the RNA stability landscape of the cortex across development and demonstrate that control of stability by the CCR4-NOT complex is essential for corticogenesis in vivo. First, we use SLAM-seq to measure RNA half-lives transcriptome-wide across multiple stages of cortical development. We characterize cis-acting features associated with RNA stability and find that RNAs that are upregulated across development tend to be more stable, while downregulated RNAs are less stable. To probe how disruption of RNA turnover impacts cortical development, we assess developmental requirements of CNOT3, a core component of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex. Mutations in CNOT3 are associated with human neurodevelopmental disorders, however its role in cortical development is unknown. Conditional knockout of Cnot3 in neural progenitors and their progeny in the developing mouse cortex leads to severe microcephaly due to reduced neuron production and p53-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that fine-tuned control of RNA turnover is crucial for brain development.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

To address this issue, we recorded the spiking activity of single SC neurons while photoactivating cortical areas in awake head-fixed Thy1-ChR2 rats. We classified 309 neurons that responded significantly into 8 clusters according to the response dynamics. Among them, neurons with monophasic excitatory responses (7-12 ms latency) that returned to baseline within 20 ms were commonly observed in the optic and intermediate gray layers of centromedial and centrolateral SC. In contrast, neurons with complex polyphasic responses were commonly observed in the deep layers of the anterolateral SC. Cross-correlation analysis suggested that the complex pattern could be only partly explained by an internal circuit of the deep gray layer. Our results indicate that medial to centrolateral SC neurons simply relay cortical activity, whereas neurons in the deep layers of the anterolateral SC dynamically integrate inputs from the cortex, SNr, CN, and local circuits. These findings suggest a spatial gradient in SC integration, with a division of labor between simple relay circuits and those integrating complex dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) efficiently eliminates transcription-blocking lesions (TBLs), thereby safeguarding accurate transcription, preserving correct cellular function and counteracting aging. TC-NER initiation involves the recognition of lesion-stalled Pol II by CSB, which recruits the CRL4CSA E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and UVSSA. TBL-induced ubiquitylation of Pol II at lysine 1268 of the RPB1 subunit by CRL4CSA serves as a critical TC-NER checkpoint, governing Pol II stability and initiating TBL excision by TFIIH recruitment. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of the CRL4CSA E3 ligase activity and TFIIH recruitment remain elusive. Here, we reveal Inactive Serine/Threonine Kinase 19 (STK19) as a novel TC-NER factor, that is essential for correct TBL removal repair and subsequent transcription restart. Cryo-EM studies demonstrate that STK19 is an integral part of the Pol II-TC-NER complex, bridging CSA with UVSSA, RPB1 and downstream DNA.

Palm1 binds to the N-terminal region of betaII-spectrin, a core MPS component, and is periodically organized along the axon in hippocampal neurons. Applying the 3D imaging power of MINFLUX, we locate Palm1 in close proximity (<20 nm) to the actin-capping protein and MPS component adducin. Functionally, Palm1 overexpression enhances the degree of periodicity of several MPS proteins (betaII-spectrin, adducin, and ankyrinB) without altering their local concentrations, while the knock-out severely compromises the MPS structure and modifies electrophysiological properties of neurons. Both the MPS-binding and remodelling activities of Palm1 are abolished by mutating a single amino acid (W54A) in the conserved Paralemmin sequence motif.

We uncover waves of transcription and reveal that a brief differentiation signal launches sustained and propagating changes in RNA synthesis and mRNA expression over cell divisions.

Recently, technological advances in virtual reality (VR) headsets and deep neural network for generative computer vision have enabled the controlled, immersive simulation of visual hallucinations. Although there is some evidence that simulated visual hallucinations increase cognitive flexibility, comprehensive experimental data on how this artificially altered perceptual phenomenology affects high-level human cognition is lacking. We addressed this gap by measuring a wide range of behavioral tasks in human participants after the exposure to VR immersive panoramic (360{degrees}) videos and their psychedelic counterparts generated by the DeepDream algorithm. Participants exhibited reduced task-switching costs after simulated psychedelic exposure compared to naturalistic exposure when instructed to invert the stimulus-response mapping, consistent with increased cognitive flexibility. No significant differences were observed between naturalistic and simulated psychedelic exposure in linguistic association tasks at word and sentence levels. Crucially, we found that visually grounded high-level cognitive processes were modulated by exposure to simulated hallucinations, as evidenced by participants drawing performance. These findings reveal how altering perceptual phenomenology through simulated visual hallucinations significantly modulates high-level human cognition. Our results provide insights into the interdependence of bottom-up and top-down cognitive processes and encourage further investigation into the effects of artificial psychedelic experiences on human cognition.

This outbreak is associated with the 2.3.4.4b clade of influenza A, and it is as yet unclear what factors have contributed to its spread at the continental scale. In this study we use Bayesian additive regression trees, a machine learning method designed for probabilistic modelling of complex nonlinear phenomena, to construct species distribution models for HPAI presence across Europe. Using these models we identify factors driving the geospatial distribution of cases and project the distribution of risk across Europe. Our models are stratified by time to capture both seasonal changes in risk patterns and shifts in HPAI epidemiology associated with the introduction of the 2.3.4.4b clade. While previous studies have aimed to predict HPAI presence from physical geography, here we explicitly consider the impact of wild bird ecology by including in our model estimates of bird species richness, abundance of specific high-risk bird taxa, and ""species-trait abundance indices"" describing the total abundance of species with high-risk behavioural and/or dietary traits. Our projections point to a shift in concentration of risk towards cold, low-lying regions of coastal northwest Europe associated with 2.3.4.4b, with the margins of uncertainty extending that risk further into central and eastern Europe. In coastal northwest Europe specifically, we predict a persistence of high risk throughout the year.

A popular MPI is the flash-lag effect, where a static object briefly presented in spatiotemporal alignment with a moving object, is perceived in a position behind the moving object. Recently, Cottier et al. (2023) observed that there are stable individual differences in the magnitude of these illusions, and possibly even their direction. To investigate the possible neural correlates of these individual differences, the present study explored whether a trait-like component of brain activity, individual alpha frequency (IAF), could predict individual illusion magnitude. Previous reports have found some correlations between IAF and perceptual tasks. Participants (N=61) viewed the flash-lag effect (motion and luminance), Frohlich effect, flash-drag effect, flash-grab effect, motion-induced position shift, twinkle-goes effect, and the flash-jump effect. In a separate session, five minutes of eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state EEG data was recorded. Correlation analyses revealed no evidence for a correlation between IAF and the magnitude of any MPIs. Overall, these results suggest that IAF does not represent a mechanism underlying MPIs, and that no single shared mechanism underlies these effects. This suggests that discrete sampling at alpha frequency is unlikely to be responsible for any of these illusions.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

In this study we aimed to assess and compare the performance of three prominent AI language models--ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini Advanced--with second-year periodontics residents across the United States on the American Academy of Periodontology 2024 in-service examination.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study using 331 multiple-choice questions from the 2024 periodontology in-service examination. We evaluated and compared the performances of ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini Advanced across various question domains. The results of second-year periodontics residents served as a benchmark.

ResultsChatGPT-4o, Gemini Advanced, and Claude 3 Opus significantly outperformed second-year periodontics residents across the United States, with accuracy rates of 92.7 percent, 81.6 percent, and 78.5 percent, respectively, compared to the residents 61.9 percent. The differences in performance among the AI models were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Percentile rankings underscored the superior performance of the AI models, with ChatGPT-4o, Gemini Advanced, and Claude 3 Opus placing in the 99.95th, 98th, and 95th percentiles, respectively.

ConclusionChatGPT-4o displayed superior performance compared to Claude 3 Opus and Gemini Advanced. The results highlight the potential of AI large language models (LLMs) as educational tools in periodontology and emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation and validation as these technologies evolve. Researchers should explore both the integration of AI language models into periodontal education and their impact on learning outcomes and clinical decision-making.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

In silico modelling predicted the 5UTR formed two energetically separated RNA structural probabilities having a minimal free energy consistent with metabolite-binding RNA riboswitches that was distinguished by hairpin structures within the CD. Site-specific mutations were used to stabilize the 5UTR into a single RNA shape definition having negligible separation between the mountain plot structure prediction curves and a distal terminator-like hairpin structure. Stabilizing the 5UTR shape triggered the posttranscriptional repression of FiLUC activity enabled by the CaMV35S promoter in tobacco transient assays and stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines. The stabilised shape fragment became responsive to metabolic feedback induced by norflurazon and in crtiso mutant etiolated and de-etiolated seedlings.

STK19 is a factor affecting cell survival and recovery of RNA synthesis in response to DNA damage, however, whether it is a necessary component for TCR is unknown. Here we demonstrated that STK19 is essential for human TCR. Mechanistically, STK19 is recruited to damage sites through direct interaction with CSA. It can also interact with RNA polymerase II in vitro. Once recruited, STK19 plays an important role in UVSSA ubiquitination which is needed for TCR. STK19 also promotes TCR independent of UVSSA ubiquitination by stimulating TFIIH recruitment through its direct interaction with TFIIH. In summary, our results suggest that STK19 is a key factor of human TCR that links CSA, UVSSA ubiquitination and TFIIH loading, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of TCR.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

These interactions occur at different levels including exchange of metabolites and reducing power, organelle signaling pathways and intracellular gas exchange. Mitochondrial retrograde stress signaling activates expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial components, including alternative oxidases. High abundances of these respiratory enzymes coincide not only with the changes in plant respiration but also with alterations in the chloroplast. For example, plants that overexpress alternative oxidases are tolerant to methyl viologen, a redox-active compound that catalyzes transfer of electrons from Photosystem I to molecular oxygen. The mechanism of this inter-organelle interaction is unclear but could be related to diminished availability of tissue oxygen. Here we assessed respiration, photosynthesis and in vivo levels of oxygen in a set of Arabidopsis lines with perturbations in diverse mitochondrial functions, including defects in respiratory complex I, mitochondrial protein processing, transcription, nucleoid organization, altered fission and architecture or suppressed ATP synthase activity. In these lines, the increased abundance and activity of alternative oxidases strongly correlated with higher oxygen consumption in darkness, lower oxygen re-accumulation in light, and diminished effects of methyl viologen in chloroplasts. These results support the hypothesis that increased mitochondrial oxygen sink capacity affects photosynthesis by decreasing oxygen levels in tissues. This phenomenon can be one of the reasons for the impact that stressed mitochondria have on chloroplasts and photosynthesis. It contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of hypoxia establishment and acclimation in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Despite best efforts, the occasional introduction of errors is inevitable, especially where the experimental data are of limited resolution. We have previously established a novel protein structure validation approach based on spotting inconsistencies between the residue contacts and distances observed in a structural model and those computationally predicted by methods such as AlphaFold 2. It is particularly well-suited to the detection of register errors. Importantly, the new approach is orthogonal to traditional methods based on stereochemistry or map-model agreement, and is resolution-independent. Here we identify thousands of likely register errors by scanning 3-5A resolution structures in the PDB. Unlike most methods, application of our approach yields suggested corrections to the register of affected regions which we show, even by limited implementation, lead to improved refinement statistics in the vast majority of cases. A few limitations and confounding factors such as fold-switching proteins are characterised, but we expect our approach to have broad application in spotting potential issues in current accessions and, through its implementation and distribution in CCP4, helping ensure the accuracy of future deposits.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

While much of the current understanding of P. syringae is centered on interactions with flowering plants, much less is known about infection in evolutionarily divergent non-flowering lineages. Here, we took a comparative evolutionary approach to understand how P. syringae infects distantly related plants. We identify broad host P. syringae isolates causing significant disease in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the flowering plant Nicotiana benthamiana, which last shared a common ancestor over 500 million years ago. We demonstrate that phytotoxin enriched isolates belonging to the phylogroup 2 clade of the P. syringae species complex are particularly virulent in non-flowering plants, relying on a combination of type-3 secreted effector proteins and the lipopeptide phytotoxin syringomycin. The application of purified syringomycin promotes necrosis in diverse host tissues and activates conserved genes associated with redox regulation and cell death. Toxin-deficient phylogroups normally unable to infect Marchantia thalli exhibit enhanced bacterial growth when supplemented with exogenous syringomycin, further highlighting its role as a host-range defining factor in Pseudomonas. Collectively our research reveals a key role for the lipopeptide syringomycin in promoting Pseudomonas colonization, which works in concert with type-3 effector proteins to antagonize an exceptionally wide spectrum of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

This is a powerful approach since it is a multi-region measurement, but because the imaging is done post-mortem, each animal only provides one set of counts. Experiments are expensive and since cells are counted by imaging and aligning a large number of brain sections, they are time-intensive. The resulting datasets tend to be under-sampled with fewer animals than brain regions. As a consequence, these data are a challenge for traditional statistical approaches. We demonstrate that hierarchical Bayesian methods are well suited to these data by presenting a  standard partially-pooled Bayesian model for multi-region cell-count data and applying it to two example datasets. For both datasets the Bayesian model outperformed standard parallel t-tests. Overall, the Bayesian approachs ability to capture nested data and its rigorous handling of uncertainty in under-sampled data can substantially improve inference for cell-count data.

Significance StatementCell-count data is important for studying neuronal activation and gene expression relating to the complex processes in the brain. However, the difficulty and expense of data collection means that such datasets often have small sample sizes. Many routine analyses are not well-suited, especially if there is high variability among animals and surprising outliers in the data. Here we describe a multilevel, mixed effects Bayesian model for these data and show that the Bayesian approach improves inferences compared to the usual approach for two different cell-count datasets with different data characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

How the physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm affect spindle architecture and size remains largely unknown. Using quantitative biochemistry in combination with adaptive feedback microscopy, we investigated mitotic cell and spindle morphology during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells. While tubulin biochemistry and microtubule dynamics remained unchanged, spindles changed their scaling behaviour: in differentiating cells, spindles were significantly smaller than those in equally-sized undifferentiated stem cells. Integrating quantitative phase imaging, biophysical perturbations and theory, we found that as cells differentiated, their cytoplasm became more dilute. The concomitant decrease in free tubulin activated CPAP (centrosomal P4.1-associated protein) to enhance the centrosomal nucleation capacity. As a consequence, in differentiating cells, microtubule mass shifted towards spindle poles at the expense of the spindle bulk, explaining the differentiation-associated switch in spindle architecture. This study shows that cell state-specific cytoplasmic density tunes mitotic spindle architecture.

The lack of a comprehensive understanding on the biology of the disease is paralleled by its dismal survival rates (5-20%). To overcome this challenge, we first identified and prioritized urgently needed resources for clinicians and researchers. Thus, we established genome-wide single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk proteomic data of in vitro and in vivo-generated knockdown models of the pathognomonic DSRCT fusion oncoprotein (EWSR1::WT1) and combined them with an original systems-biology-based pipeline including patient data and the largest histology collection of DSRCTs and morphological mimics available to date. These novel tools were enriched with curated public datasets including patient- and cell line-derived ChIP-seq, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq studies resulting in a multi-model and multi-omic toolbox for discovery analyses. As a proof of concept, our approach revealed the alpha-2/delta subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, CACNA2D2, as a highly overexpressed, super-enhancer driven, direct target of EWSR1::WT1. Single-cell and bulk-level analyses of patient samples and xenografted cell lines highlighted CACNA2D2 as a critical component of our newly established EWSR1::WT1 oncogenic signature, that can be employed to robustly identify DSRCT in reference sets. Finally, we show that CACNA2D2 is a highly sensitive and specific single biomarker for fast, simple, and cost-efficient diagnosis of DSRCT. Collectively, we establish a large-scale multi-omics dataset for this devastating disease and provide a blueprint of how such toolbox can be used to identify new and clinically relevant diagnostic markers, which may significantly reduce misdiagnoses, and thus improve patient care.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

We show that one of these, CSEP0214, interacts with the barley VPS18 protein, a core component of the CORVET and HOPS endosomal tethering complexes, mediating fusions of early endosomes and multivesicular bodies with the central vacuole, respectively. Overexpression of CSEP0214 and knockdown of either VPS18, HOPS-specific VPS41 or CORVET-specific VPS8 caused a block of the vacuolar pathway and the accumulation of the fluorescent vacuolar marker protein (SP)-RFP-AFVY in the endoplasmic reticulum. Co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid experiments suggest that CSEP0214 blocks the interaction of VPS18 and VPS16, which are both core components of CORVET as well as HOPS. Additionally, expression of CSEP0214 blocked the hypersensitive cell death response associated with resistance gene-mediated immunity in barley, indicating that endomembrane traffic is required for this process. It also prevented callose deposition in cell wall appositions at attack sites and encasements of fungal infection structures. Our results indicate that this powdery mildew core effector is an essential immunity suppressor.

Previous studies, including our own research, have shown that specific interneuron subtypes are closely associated with particular pyramidal neuron types, forming stereotyped local inhibitory microcircuits. However, the developmental processes that establish these precise networks are not well understood. Here we show that pyramidal neuron types are instrumental in driving the terminal differentiation and maintaining the survival of specific associated interneuron subtypes. In a wild-type cortex, the relative abundance of different interneuron subtypes aligns precisely with the pyramidal neuron types to which they synaptically target. In Fezf2 mutant cortex, characterized by the absence of layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons and an expansion of layer 6 intratelencephalic neurons, we observed a corresponding decrease in associated layer 5b interneurons and an increase in layer 6 subtypes. Interestingly, these shifts in composition are achieved through mechanisms specific to different interneuron types. While SST interneurons adjust their abundance to the change in pyramidal neuron prevalence through the regulation of programmed cell death, parvalbumin interneurons alter their identity. These findings illustrate two key strategies by which the dynamic interplay between pyramidal neurons and interneurons allows local microcircuits to be sculpted precisely. These insights underscore the precise roles of extrinsic signals from pyramidal cells in the establishment of interneuron diversity and their subsequent integration into local cortical microcircuits.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

Study DesignSixty-six participants with psychotic disorders were longitudinally assessed soon after inpatient admission, at discharge, and at 3- and 6-months. Psychosis symptoms were measured with semi-structured interviews and standardized scales. Recordings were collected from paragraph reading, fluency, picture description, and open-ended tasks. Longitudinal relationships between psychosis symptoms and 357 automated speech and language features were analyzed using a single component score and as individual features, using linear mixed models.

Study ResultsAll three psychosis symptom domains demonstrated significant longitudinal relationships with the single component score. Thought Disorder was particularly related to features describing more subordinated constructions, less efficient identification of picture elements, and decreased semantic distance between sentences. Negative Symptoms was related to features describing decreased speech complexity. Positive Symptoms appeared heterogeneous, with Suspiciousness relating to greater use of nouns, and Hallucinations related to decreased semantic distances. These relationships were largely robust to interactions with gender and race. However, interactions with timepoint revealed variable relationships during different phases of illness (acute vs. stable).

ConclusionsAutomated speech and language features show promise as scalable, objective markers of psychosis severity. The three symptom domains appear to be distinguishable with different features. Detailed attention to clinical setting and patient population is needed to optimize clinical translation; there are substantial implications for facilitating differential diagnosis, improving psychosis outcomes and enhancing therapeutic discovery.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

The latest example is the BA.2.86 Variant Of Interest (VOI), which rapidly outcompeted all other lineages following its detection in late July 2023. Descending sublineages dominated globally by July 2024, at the time of writing this study. The mechanisms by which highly-divergent viral lineages tend to emerge remain unclear, with the most strongly supported hypothesis being the acquisition of multiple mutations through accelerated evolution in chronically infected individuals, with spread back into the community facilitated by prolonged shedding. We used BA.2.86 as a case study to investigate the evolutionary process behind the emergence of a highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant. Through fine-scale evolutionary analyses applied to four independently subsampled datasets, we identify over 100 genomes representing evolutionary intermediates occupying the branch in the phylogenetic tree leading to the BA.2.86*/JN.1* clade. Additionally, we detected more than 2,600  hybrid genomes across the evolutionary history of the Omicron-descending BA.2* sub-lineages, displaying a sequential acquisition of BA.2.86 lineage-defining mutation constellations through time. We observe that hybrid strains circulated up to 19 months prior to BA.2.86, denoting cryptic circulation in various countries, with further evidence of early transmission chains. We also found signals of recombination between pre-existing parental lineages, suggesting that this process contributed to the emergence of BA.2.86. Our results suggest that the BA.2.86 lineage emerged sequentially through a complex evolutionary process, rather than via accelerated evolution associated with a single emergence event.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

There are no vaccines available and no effective treatments for these patients. Another challenge is that Cryptosporidia are waterborne and resistant to common water treatments including chlorination. Cryptosporidia are transmitted as an oocyst that is made up of a hardy oocyst wall that protects four parasites. Little is understood about how the oocyst is constructed, its composition, and the how it resists chlorination. A family of predicted Cryptosporidium Oocyst Wall Proteins (COWPs) was identified from the genome. Using a genetic approach, we confirm that all members of the COWP family localise to the oocyst wall. Our studies indicate that COWP2, 3 and 4 localise specifically to the oocyst ""suture"", a zipper-like structure on the oocyst wall from which parasites emerge during infection. In parasites lacking COWP8, we observe that the inner and outer layers of the oocyst wall are no longer associated suggesting a role for COWP8 in oocyst wall morphology. Despite loss of COWP8, these transgenic parasites are viable, unchanged in mechanical strength, and retain resistance to chlorination.

Here, we present a comprehensive one month-long molecular and physiological high-throughput profiling of potato (Solanum tuberosum, cv.

Acclimation time-responses were monitored via daily phenomic analysis and leaf samples were processed for multi-omics spanning from transcriptomics to proteomics and hormonomics. Additionally, critical metabolites of tuber samples were analysed at the end of the period. To facilitate the multi-omics analyses, the dataset was integrated with prior knowledge, which is indispensable for development of high-throughput pipelines in agricultural research. Waterlogging had the most immediate and dramatic effects, with responses similar to drought stress. In addition, we observed distinct stress signatures at multiple molecular levels in response to heat or drought and to a combination of both. In general, there was a downregulation of photosynthesis at different molecular levels, accumulation of minor amino acids and diverse stress induced hormones.

While the aetiology of Parkinsons disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question.

The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired both before and after administration of L-Dopa. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

Here, we report cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) structural analysis of two full-length {gamma}{delta} TCRs, G115 (V{gamma}9V{delta}2) and 9C2 (V{gamma}5V{delta}1), in complex with CD3 subunits.

We corroborate this finding in cells by demonstrating that a {gamma}{delta} T-cell specific antibody can bind a site that would be inaccessible in the more rigid {beta} TCR/CD3 complex. Furthermore, we observed that a V{gamma}5V{delta}1 complex forms a TCR {gamma}5-chain mediated dimeric species whereby two TCR/CD3 complexes are assembled.

RNF168 activity is triggered by DSB signaling cascades, reportedly through K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation of linker histone H1. However, direct experimental evidence of this mechanism has been elusive, primarily due to the lack of methods to specifically poly-ubiquitylate H1. Here, we developed a versatile click-chemistry approach to covalently link multiple proteins in a site-specific, controlled, and stepwise manner. Applying this method, we synthesized H1 constructs bearing triazole-linked di-ubiquitin on four DNA repair-associated ubiquitylation hotspots (H1KxUb2, at K17, 46, 64 and 96). Integrated into nucleosome arrays, the H1KxUb2 variants stimulated H2A ubiquitylation by RNF168 in a position-dependent manner, with H1K17Ub2 showing the strongest RNF168 activation effect. Moreover, we show that di-ubiquitin binding is the driving force underlying RNF168 recruitment, introducing H1K17Ub2 into living U-2 OS cells. Together, our results support the hypothesis of poly-ubiquitylated H1 guiding RNF168 recruitment to DSB sites. Moreover, we demonstrate how the streamlined synthesis of H1KxUb2 variants enables mechanistic studies into RNF168 regulation, with potential implications for its inhibition in susceptible cancers.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

In these molecular assemblies, termed ""coupled transcription-translation complexes"" or ""TTC-B"", RNA polymerase (RNAP) interacts directly with the ribosome, the transcription elongation factor NusG or its paralog RfaH forms a bridge between RNAP and ribosome, and the transcription elongation factor NusA optionally forms a second bridge between RNAP and ribosome. Here, we have determined structures of coupled transcription-translation complexes having mRNA spacers between RNAP and ribosome longer than the maximum-length mRNA spacer compatible with formation of TTC-B. The results define a new class of coupled transcription-translation complex, termed ""TTC-LC,"" where ""LC"" denotes ""long-range coupling."" TTC-LC differs from TTC-B by a [~]60{degrees} rotation and [~]70 [A] translation of RNAP relative to ribosome, resulting in loss of direct interactions between RNAP and ribosome and creation of a [~]70 [A] gap between RNAP and ribosome. TTC-LC accommodates long mRNA spacers by looping out mRNA from the gap between RNAP and ribosome. We propose that TTC-LC is an intermediate in assembling and disassembling TTC-B, mediating pre-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling before a ribosome catches up to RNAP, and mediating post-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling after a ribosome stops moving and RNAP continues moving.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

To resolve this question, we generate a deletion series of the mouse Y chromosome, creating thirteen Y-deletant mouse models and conducting exhaustive reproductive phenotyping. Eight Y genes, including several that are deeply conserved and exhibit testis-specific expression, are dispensable for spermatogenesis. For others, we uncover novel functions, including a role for Uty in establishment and differentiation of spermatogonia, and for Zfy2 in ensuring meiotic pairing and reciprocal recombination between the sex chromosomes. We also generate the first mouse equivalent of the human infertility AZFa deletion, revealing cumulative detrimental effects of Y-gene loss on spermatogenesis. We use single nuclei RNAseq to identify candidate mechanisms by which Y genes regulate the germ cell transcriptome and reveal an unexpected impact of Y genes on testis supporting cells.

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.

Author summaryAvian influenza viruses (AIVs) play a critical role in the evolution of pandemic influenza viruses. Adaptive changes in AIVs enable them to infect mammalian species by altering viral interactions with host-specific factors, and one well-known example is the PB2-E627K mutation. Fortunately, this mutation is sporadic and rare in AIVs, usually occurring after infecting humans, and AIVs with PB2-627E, which is prevalent in poultry, cannot easily infect humans. However, if an AIV manages to overcome this species barrier, the risk of a pandemic originating from an AIV will significantly increase. In our study, we identified a dual adaptive variant called PB2-627V that combines avian-like properties of PB2-627E and human-like properties of PB2-627K. This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function. The mutation exhibited good fitness in both birds and humans, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. The PB2-627V polymorphism has been found in birds, humans, and mammals worldwide across more than ten AIV subtypes. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, we recommend considering PB2-627V as a new molecular marker to assess the pandemic potential of AIVs.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

ConclusionPublished sample size calculations that use G*Power are not transparently reported and may not be well-informed. Given the popularity of software packages like G*Power, they present an intervention point to increase the prevalence of informative sample size calculations.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

Antioxidant delivery as a therapeutic for AAA is of substantial interest although clinical translation of antioxidant therapy has met with significant challenges due to limitations in achieving sufficient antioxidant levels at the site of AAA. We posit that nanoparticle-based approaches hold promise to overcome challenges associated with systemic administration of antioxidants.

MethodsWe employed a peptide-based nanoplatform to overexpress a key modulator of oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). The efficacy of systemic delivery of SOD2 mRNA as a nanotherapeutic agent was studied in two different murine AAA models. Unbiased mass spectrometry-enabled proteomics and high-dimensional bioinformatics were used to examine pathways modulated by SOD2 overexpression.

ResultsThe murine SOD2 mRNA sequence was mixed with p5RHH, an amphipathic peptide capable of delivering nucleic acids in vivo to form self-assembled nanoparticles of [~]55 nm in diameter. We further demonstrated that the nanoparticle was stable and functional up to four weeks following self-assembly when coated with hyaluronic acid. Delivery of SOD2 mRNA mitigated the expansion of small AAA and largely prevented rupture. Mitigation of AAA was accompanied by enhanced SOD2 protein expression in aortic wall tissue. Concomitant suppression of nitric oxide, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and cell death was observed. Proteomic profiling of AAA tissues suggests that SOD2 overexpression augments levels of microRNAs that regulate vascular inflammation and cell apoptosis, inhibits platelet activation/aggregation, and downregulates mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Gene set enrichment analysis shows that SOD2 mRNA delivery is associated with activation of oxidative phosphorylation, lipid metabolism, respiratory electron transportation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways.

ConclusionsThese results confirm that SOD2 is key modulator of oxidative stress in AAA. This nanotherapeutic mRNA delivery approach may find translational application in the medical management of small AAA and the prevention of AAA rupture.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

However, empty droplets and poor quality cells are often captured in single cell genomics experiments and need to be removed to avoid cell type interpretation errors. Many automated and manual methods exist to identify poor quality cells or empty droplets, such as minimum RNA count thresholds and comparing the gene expression profile of an individual cell to the overall background RNA expression of the experiment. A versatile approach is to use unbalanced overall RNA splice ratios of cells to identify poor quality cells or empty droplets. However, this approach is computationally intensive, requiring a detailed search through all sequence reads in the experiment to quantify spliced and unspliced reads. We found that the expression level of MALAT1, a non-coding RNA retained in the nucleus and ubiquitously expressed across cell types, is strongly correlated with this splice ratio measure and thus can be used to similarly identify low quality cells in scRNA-seq data. Since it is easy to visualize the expression of a single gene in single-cell maps, MALAT1 expression is a simple cell quality measure that can be quickly used during the cell annotation process to improve the interpretation of cells in tissues of human, mouse and other species with a conserved MALAT1 function.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

While PacBio HiFi sequencing data enhances the accessibility of the genomes TR regions for genotyping, simple de novo calling strategies often generate an excess of likely false positives, which can obscure true positive findings, particularly as the number of surveyed genomic regions increases.

ResultsWe developed TRGT-denovo, a computational method designed to accurately identify all types of de novo TR mutations--including expansions, contractions, and compositional changes-- within family trios. TRGT-denovo directly interrogates read evidence, allowing for the detection of subtle variations often overlooked in variant call format (VCF) files. TRGT-denovo improves the precision and specificity of de novo mutation (DNM) identification, reducing the number of de novo candidates by an order of magnitude compared to genotype-based approaches. In our experiments involving eight rare disease trios previously studied TRGT-denovo correctly reclassified all false positive DNM candidates as true negatives. Using an expanded repeat catalog, it identified new candidates, of which 95% (19/20) were experimentally validated, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing likely false positives while maintaining high sensitivity for true discoveries.

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations.

MethodsA large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

ResultsThe study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19s risk surpassing influenzas risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50).

ConclusionIn this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1721858926416

Mobile Integrons (MI) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function (gcus) whose role and adaptive value remains unexplored. Recent years have witnessed the discovery of a myriad defence systems against bacteriophages, highlighting that viral infection is a major selective pressure for bacteria. We hence sought to explore if gcus could encode phage defence systems. Using the INTEGRALL database, we established a collection of 129 gcus in pMBA, a vector where cassettes are established as part of a class 1 integron. PADLOC and DefenseFinder predicted four phage defence systems in this collection, comprising Lamassu, CBASS and two ABI (abortive infection) systems. We experimentally challenged all cassettes with phages and found nine additional candidates that were not detected in silico. We have characterized in depth the 13 gcus against a panel of phages in Escherichia coli confirming their role as phage defence integron cassettes (PICs). We used recombination assays to verify that all systems are bona fide integron cassettes and are therefore mobile. We show that pics confer resistance in other clinically relevant species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several PICs also limit prophage activation, providing protection at the population-level. Given the stockpiling capacity of integrons, we explored the additivity of phenotypes and found that integrons with two PICs confer multiphage-resistance. Additionally, when combined with antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons confer simultaneously drug and phage resistance. Crucially, we also show that the position of a PIC in the array can strongly decrease its cost. Our results prove a role of integrons in phage defence, acting as highly mobile, low-cost defence islands. This has important implications in the spread of defence systems, and on the future of phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1721858926416
