Borrelia is known to disseminate through organs, including the skin, joints, spinal cord, bladder, and heart, leading to Lyme arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme carditis. While previous studies have investigated the impact of LD on pregnancy in both mice and humans and have found the presence of B. burgdorferi in the uterus of mice, we studied the impact of LD on the non-pregnant female reproductive tract. We use a mouse model for LD and find an ongoing and severe infection of the reproductive tract of female mice, which persists up to 15-months post-inoculation. This infection results in uterine glandular cysts and endometrial hyperplasia as well as vaginal epithelial thickening, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell epithelial infiltration, and epithelial desquamation into the vaginal lumen. Strikingly, we find that age has an impact on the extent of gynecologic pathology such that aged female mice (1-year old) that are reproductively senescent have more gynecologic pathology with infection compared to young mice (15-weeks old) when infected for the same length of time. Using large-scale electronic healthcare record data, we report that LD additionally results in increased infection-associated risk of menorrhagia (1.5-fold), miscarriage (1.62-fold), uterine fibroids (1.42-fold), and endometriosis (1.93-fold). Underreporting of gynecological outcomes is pervasive throughout many different infectious diseases, and LD-associated gynecological pathologies may have been similarly underappreciated in the field. This work suggests that further study of the female reproductive tract and the effects of B. burgdorferi infection therein will help clarify and expand the knowledge of myriad LD outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129348

Our optimized workflows achieved high editing efficiencies and produced genetically modified mice with simultaneous editing of up to seven different genes. Selected modifications include loss-of-function mutations in Fgf5, Tgm3, and Fam83g, among others. The resulting mice display exaggerated hair phenotypes including curly, textured coats, and golden-brown hair. This study establishes a rapid platform for testing mammoth-centric genetic variants while advancing methods for complex genetic model generation. These approaches inform de-extinction efforts and research into the genetic basis of mammalian hair development and cold adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

While recent studies indicate that nucleosomes are clustered as condensed chromatin domains in higher eukaryotic cells, how histone H1 mechanically condenses chromatin remains unclear. Here, using a combination of direct visualization of single-H1 molecules in living human cells and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the majority of H1 behaves like a liquid inside chromatin domains, rather than binding stably to nucleosomes as suggested by the traditional model. H1 functions as a liquid-like ''glue'', mediating dynamic multivalent interactions between nucleosomes within chromatin domains. Consistently, rapid-depletion of H1.2 leads to decondensed chromatin domains both in cells and in silico. Our findings suggest that the H1 ''glue'' condenses chromatin domains while keeping them fluid and accessible, thereby supporting essential DNA transactions.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

Yet to date, the mechanism of HGT among eukaryotes has remained a mystery. Here, we demonstrate that Starships, a newly discovered group of cargo-mobilizing transposable elements, are active vectors of horizontally transferred DNA among eukaryotic species. We find that multiple Starships simultaneously transfer themselves and their cargo within and between fungal genera separated by upwards of 100 million years of evolution. Transferred Starships are recovered in strains with and without selection for particular Starship-encoded phenotypes. Using whole genome sequencing, we exclude alternative hypotheses such as heterokaryosis, parasex or the random uptake of exogenous DNA by showing that only Starship DNA is precisely transferred. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of the Hephaestus Starship into a new species increases metal resistance due to the genes carried by this element. Between 18-27% of all Starships in our focal genus, Paecilomyces, have evidence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, including to other fungal genera, revealing Starship-mediated HGT to be a widespread and frequent phenomenon across filamentous fungi. This study identifies the first active genetic mechanism for HGT between eukaryotic species.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

While LC symptoms vary widely, neuropathy is one of the most prevalent symptoms and drastically affects quality of life. However, the underlying pathophysiology of LC neuropathy remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the prevalence and potential mechanisms of LC neuropathy in the largest LC neuropathy cohort to date. Methods: We conducted an observational study of 977 adults with LC at Dell Medical School. Participants underwent clinical assessments, skin punch biopsy, and comprehensive metabolic, endocrine and immunological profiling. A subset of patients received treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. Findings: Neuropathic symptoms were reported by 55% (534/977) participants, with skin biopsy confirming small fiber neuropathy in 57.7% (49/85) cases, affecting both epidermal and autonomic nerve fibers. Common risk factors for neuropathy, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, did not fully explain neuropathic symptoms. While general immunological markers (lymphocyte, T cell, and B cell count and CRP) were unremarkable, unexpectedly, we detected anti-ganglioside antibodies (AGAs) in 25% of patients with LC neuropathy. Longitudinal testing revealed persistent AGA positivity, and multiple elevated AGAs in a subset of patients. In a pilot treatment cohort of eight patients, IVIG treatment resulted in improvement of patient reported neuropathic symptoms. Interpretation: Our findings reveal a high prevalence of small fiber neuropathy in LC, with evidence suggesting an autoimmune mechanism involving AGAs in one in four LC neuropathy patients. The therapeutic response to IVIG further supports an autoimmune pathophysiology, suggesting potential benefits of immunomodulation in LC neuropathy patients.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129348

Despite its suggested high genetic and morphological diversity, key aspects such as nuclear DNA (nuDNA) population structure and relationship between body color patterns and genetic populations remain unclear. To address these gaps, this study analyzed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nuDNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) markers in samples from Hokkaido to the Tokara Islands, Japan. Admixture analysis identified five distinct populations with significant geographic boundaries. These populations exhibited unique geographical patterns, spanning across islands and enclave distribution, indicating that G. dehaani populations have been shaped by complex factors, including sea level changes and volcanic activity. Regional body color variations partially aligned with SNP clades. Further, combining body color with collection locality data could help identify the specimen populations. Contrasting patterns between mtDNA and nuDNA suggest historical gene flow and adaptive introgression, emphasizing the need for caution when interpreting earlier phylogenetic studies based on combined mtDNA and nuDNA sequences. Our findings provide a foundational baseline for future research into the taxonomy, phylogeny, and population dynamics of the G. dehaani species complex, advancing our understanding of its evolutionary history.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

Subsequently, spillovers of the virus from dairy cattle to humans have been reported. Pigs are an important reservoir in influenza ecology because they serve as a mixing vessel in which novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential can be generated. Here, we show that oro-respiratory infection of pigs resulted in productive replication of a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus. Infectious virus was mainly identified in the lower respiratory tract of principal infected pigs, and sero-conversion was observed in most of the principal pigs at later time points. In one animal, we detected the emergence of a mutation in hemagglutinin (HA) previously associated with increased affinity for mammalian-type alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid receptors, but this mutation did not reach consensus levels. Sentinel contact pigs remained sero-negative throughout the study, indicating lack of transmission. The results support that pigs are susceptible to a bovine-derived HPAI H5N1 B3.13 virus, but this virus did not replicate as robustly in pigs as mink-derived HPAI H5N1 and swine-adapted influenza viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

Unsupervised archetype analysis identified both shared and site-specific gene programs, including lipid metabolism and gastrointestinal programs prevalent in peritoneum and stomach wall lesions, respectively. We developed a probabilistic approach for inferring clonal phylogeny from single-cell and matched whole-exome data. Distantly related genetic clones in the peritoneum express the lipid metabolism program, likely due to signaling by the adipocyte-rich peritoneum environment, and cells in most clones express multiple programs, suggesting that transcriptomic plasticity is a prevalent feature of metastatic cells. These deeply annotated analyses using a patient-centric platform provide a model for investigating metastatic mechanisms and plasticity in advanced cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we leverage cross-species functional neuroimaging to examine whether variability in brain functional connectivity reflects distinct biological mechanisms. We find that fMRI connectivity alterations in 20 distinct mouse models of autism (n=549 individual mice) can be clustered into two prominent hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes. We show that these connectivity profiles are linked to distinct signaling pathways, with hypoconnectivity being associated with synaptic dysfunction, and hyperconnectivity reflecting transcriptional and immune-related alterations. Extending these findings to humans, we identify analogous hypo- and hyperconnectivity subtypes in a large, multicenter resting state fMRI dataset of n=940 autistic and n=1036 neurotypical individuals. Remarkably, hypo- and hyperconnectivity autism subtypes are replicable across independent cohorts (accounting for 25.1% of all autism data), exhibit distinct functional network architecture, are behaviorally dissociable, and recapitulate synaptic and immune mechanisms identified in corresponding mouse subtypes. Our cross-species investigation, thus, decodes the heterogeneity of fMRI connectivity in autism into distinct pathway-specific etiologies, offering a new empirical framework for targeted subtyping of autism.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

Social protection interventions can benefit TB-affected households. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effectiveness of social protection on TB treatment and socioeconomic outcomes.

MethodsWe identified articles published from January 2012 to July 2024 by searching PubMed (includes MEDLINE), Embase, and Web of Science. We included studies that described at least one social protection intervention and reported on either TB treatment or socioeconomic outcomes for people with TB or TB-affected households. Random-effects meta-analysis was used for our primary outcome of interest, TB treatment success (treatment completion or cure). We performed a meta-regression to evaluate the association of study characteristics with odds of TB treatment success. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. This review was registered prospectively in the PROSPERO database (registration number CRD42022382181).

FindingsOur search generated 47,245 articles. Of the 50 which were eligible for inclusion, 36 reported TB treatment outcomes, 8 reported on socioeconomic, and two studies reported both TB treatment and socioeconomic outcomes. Random-effects meta-analysis of 24 articles found that people with TB who received social protection interventions during treatment had 2.23 times the odds of TB treatment success (95% CI 1.82, 2.74, I2 93.8%).

ConclusionSocial protection interventions significantly improve odds of TB treatment success. Outcomes and definitions used in our study have the potential to guide further research and implementation of social protection for TB-affected populations.

Summary BoxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSeveral studies have found that social and financial interventions designed to mitigate socioeconomic risk and promote resiliency, termed social protection interventions, have the potential to improve treatment outcomes for tuberculosis (TB), including treatment completion and cure. Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that social protection interventions can improve socioeconomic outcomes among TB-affected households such as averting catastrophic costs and negative financial coping strategies.

What this study addsThis is the first systematic review and meta-analysis that comprehensively evaluates the impact of TB specific and TB sensitive social protection interventions on both TB treatment and socioeconomic outcomes, thereby generating evidence on the ability of these interventions to curb the well-known cycle of TB disease and poverty. Through the use of an extensive list of search terms, expanded and systematic inclusion of outcomes of interest, and a focused definition of social protection interventions, our systematic review included the adequate number of high-quality studies needed to conduct a meta-analysis. Additionally, our systematic review evaluated implementation outcomes described in eligible studies which provides the basis for feasibility of these strategies in programmatic settings.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur study provides evidence that social protection interventions, when used in conjunction with standard biomedical treatment, have the potential to significantly improve TB treatment outcomes. This study fills an essential gap in existing synthesized evidence of the impact of social protection interventions on TB, socioeconomic, and implementation outcomes. Our findings also highlight the need for standardized definitions of social protection, as well as uniform reporting procedures, to better help evaluate the impact of social protection interventions for TB-affected individuals and households. Addressing these gaps provides scientific basis for meeting the commitments articulated in the 2023 United Nations General Assembly high level meeting for TB which calls for social protection for all individuals with TB.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129348

In former Roman territories, their emergence has traditionally been linked to mass migrations from outside the Roman Empire. However, recent studies have emphasised local continuity with some individual-level mobility. We generated and analysed 248 historic genomes from Late Roman (3rd and 4th century CE) and Early Medieval (5th-8th century CE) burial sites in southern Germany, comparing them to over 2,500 contemporary and Iron Age genomes in addition to 1,344 modern-day genomes from Germany, Italy and Great-Britain. Despite small inferred Early Medieval period community sizes, genetic diversity exceeded that of modern German cities. In the Altheim graveyard, established in the 5th century by a group of Northern European descent, we inferred a demographic shift in the 6th century with the integration of newcomers with ancestry typical of a nearby Roman military camp, likely as a result of the collapse of Roman state structures. We reconstructed multigenerational pedigrees and, using a novel approach to infer ancestry of unsampled relatives, inferred immediate intermarriage between incoming and local groups, with a distinct tendency for men from former Roman background marrying women of northern descent. Burial proximity correlates strongly with kinship, in some cases spanning six generations. These communities were organized around small family units, exhibited loosely patrilineal or bilateral descent patterns, practiced reproductive monogamy, and avoided close-kin marriages. Such practices reflect broader transformations in family structures that began during the Late Roman period, were transferred to small agrarian societies in the Early Medieval period, and continued to shape European societies. By the 7th century, ongoing admixture had shaped genetic diversity patterns into those resembling Central Europe today.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

In 2023, external funding accounted for 21% of total TB expenditures, with the U.S. contributing over 55% of these funds. The withdrawal of U.S. support threatens essential TB services, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions, and research initiatives critical to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for TB eradication.

MethodsThis study analyses the dependency of 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs) on U.S. funding and models the potential impact of funding cuts on TB incidence and mortality. Countries were classified into low (0-22%), moderate (23-37%), and high (>37%) dependency groups based on three-year expenditure data. A deterministic compartmental model simulated service disruptions under three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (permanent service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category.

FindingsFunding cuts are projected to result in substantial increases in TB cases and deaths across the three scenarios. In a high-dependency country, cumulative TB cases could rise by 2.1% (CI 1.5 - 2.5), 5.4% (CI4 - 6.5), or 36% (CI 25 - 47), and TB deaths by 2.9%(CI 2.2 - 3.5), 7.8%(CI 5.9 - 9.2), 68%(CI 45 - 86), depending on the severity of service disruptions. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45 - 0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2 - 2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85 - 13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,800 (CI 65,200-130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800-337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800-2,807,300), respectively. The findings underscore the catastrophic consequences of the funding cut, particularly in countries highly reliant on U.S. support.

InterpretationThe loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control, jeopardizing End TB and SDG targets. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain TB prevention and treatment efforts and mitigate the effects of aid withdrawal.

However, there is an ongoing need for novel TCM preparations. The aim of this study was to assess the potential and mechanism of a de novo designed TCM preparation: JinHuangJieDu (JHJD), which is composed of JIN YIN HUA, HUANG QIN, GUANG HUO XIANG, BAI ZHI, PU GONG YING and BO HE, for the treatment of COVID-19 using network pharmacology analysis and in vitro experimental validations. Methods: First, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to validate whether JHJD inhibits the binding of wild type and mutant receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by JHJD was assessed with pseudovirus neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and COS7-hACE2 cells. Network pharmacology analysis using Encyclopedia of Chinese Traditional Medicine (ETCM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology databases (TCMSP) were further performed to identify the meridional network, active ingredients and targeted genes of JHJD. Interaction networks were constructed and gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional enrichment analysis were performed using Cytoscape (3.7.1) software with ClueGO and CluePedia plugins. Vital genes were identified using CytoHubba and MCODE plugins. In vitro experiments were performed to confirm one of the targeted crucial gene and to validate whether JHJD may mitigate inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Results: JHJD effectively blocked the binding of both wild type and Omicron RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 and completely inhibited the infection of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to ACE2-positive host cells in vitro. Network pharmacology analysis uncovered that JHJD comprises a total of 378 active ingredients and 339 targeted genes, with its primary actions likely focused on lung, stomach and spleen. A total of 63 significant KEGG pathways were enriched, predominantly related to viral infection and inflammation pathways. Two pivotal genes, CCND1 and HIF1A, were identified by intersecting the MCODE module genes with different node algorithms in CytoHubba. In vitro validation confirmed that JHJD could target HIF-1, reducing virus-induced inflammation, which may potentially mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that a de novo designed TCM JHJD could effectively inhibit the infection of SARS-CoV-2 through blocking of the interaction between RBD and ACE2. The inhibitory effect appears to be particularly potent against Omicron variants, as JHJD demonstrated enhanced efficacy in inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interaction for several Omicron variants. Furthermore, JHJD could mitigate the virus-induced inflammation by targeting HIF-1. Collectively, this study suggested that JHJD preparation holds promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19, as it not only inhibits the viral entry into host cells but also reduces the inflammatory responses triggered by the infection.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

While UCST-type (upper critical solution temperature) phase behavior has been studied extensively and can now be predicted reliably using computational models, LCST-type (lower critical solution temperature) phase transitions remain less explored, with a lack of computational models capable of accurate prediction. This gap limits our ability to probe fully how proteins undergo phase transitions in response to temperature changes. Here, we introduce Mpipi-T, a residue-level coarse-grained model designed to predict LCST-type phase behavior of proteins. Parametrized using both atomistic simulations and experimental data, Mpipi-T accounts for entropically driven protein phase separation that occurs upon heating. Accordingly, Mpipi-T predicts temperature-driven protein behavior quantitatively in both single- and multi-chain systems. Beyond its predictive capabilities, we demonstrate that Mpipi-T provides a framework for uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress responses, offering new insights into how proteins sense and adapt to thermal changes in biological systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

We examine the differences in phylogenetic signal between a continuous trait partition, a discrete trait partition, and a joint analysis with both types of characters. We find that continuous and discrete traits contribute substantially different signal to the analysis, even when other parts of the model (clock and tree) are held constant. Tree topologies resulting from the new analyses differ strongly from the established phylogeny for dicynodonts, highlighting continued difficulty in incorporating truly continuous data in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129348

We developed JUNIPER (Joint Underlying Network Inference for Phylogenetic and Epidemiological Reconstructions), a highly-scalable pathogen outbreak reconstruction tool that incorporates intrahost variation, incomplete sampling, and algorithmic parallelization. Central to JUNIPER is a statistical model for within-host variant frequencies observed by next generation sequencing, which we validated on a dataset of over 160,000 deep-sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Combining this within-host variation model with population-level evolutionary and transmission models, we developed a method for inferring phylogenies and transmission trees simultaneously. We benchmarked JUNIPER on computer-generated and real outbreaks in which transmission links were known or epidemiologically confirmed. We demonstrated JUNIPERs real-world utility on two large-scale datasets: over 1,500 bovine H5N1 cases and over 13,000 human COVID-19 cases. Based on these analyses, we quantified the elevated H5N1 transmission rates in California and identified high-confidence transmission events, and demonstrated the efficacy of vaccination for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying small-molecule partitioning remain largely unknown. Here, we first exploit atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of model condensates to elucidate physicochemical rules governing small-molecule partitioning. We find that while hydrophobicity is a major determinant, solubility becomes a stronger regulator of partitioning in more polar condensates. Additionally, more polar condensates exhibit selectivity toward certain compounds, suggesting that condensate-specific therapeutics can be engineered. Building on these insights, we develop minimal models (MAPPS) for efficient prediction of small-molecule partitioning into biologically relevant condensates. We demonstrate that this approach reproduces atomistic partition coefficients in both model systems and condensates composed of the low complexity domain (LCD) of FUS. Applying MAPPS to various LCD-based condensates shows that protein sequence can exert a selective pressure, thereby influencing small-molecule partitioning. Collectively, our findings reveal that partitioning is driven by both small-molecule--protein affinity and the complex interplay between the compounds and the condensate chemical environment.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

Reflecting these diverse roles, the DRN is composed of molecularly distinct and topographically organized groups of neurons that target specific regions of the forebrain. Despite these insights, fundamental questions remain regarding how DRN neurons process sensory information, what do DRN communicate to forebrain, and the role of DRN inputs in forebrain computations and animal behavior.To address these questions, we investigated the spatiotemporal activity patterns of DRN neurons, along with DRN axons and their targets in the juvenile zebrafish forebrain. Our findings revealed a remarkable topographic organization of ongoing activity and sensory-motor responses within the DRN. We discovered that a large fraction of DRN neurons are primarily driven by animals locomotor activity. We also observed that an anterior group of DRN neurons, marked by Gad1, exhibited distinct activity patterns during rest, locomotor activity and sensory stimulation. DRN axons broadly innervating the forebrain exhibit topographically organized excitation and inhibition in response to sensory stimulation and motor activity. Notably, we observed significant and rapid covariation between the activity of DRN axons and nearby forebrain neurons. Chemogenetic ablation of the DRN led to a marked reduction in the synchrony and sensory-motor responses across forebrain neurons, accompanied by significant deficits in adaptive behaviors. Collectively, our findings revealed the functional diversity of DRN neurons and their role in transmitting sensory and locomotor signals via topographically organized projections, which can regulate forebrain activity and play a crucial role in modulating animal behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

They also represent a complex ecosystem as intricate holobionts made up of microbes from all domains of the Tree of Life, where many play significant roles in host health and fitness [4]. The corallicolids are a clade of apicomplexans that infect a wide variety of anthozoans across the world, and have been shown to influence the thermal tolerance of habitat-forming corals [1, 5]. Despite their potentially important impacts on reef ecosystems, much of the basic biology and ecology of corallicolids remains unclear. Apicomplexans often have a closed life cycle, with minimal environmental exposure, and sometimes multiple hosts. Corallicolids have only been documented in anthozoan hosts, with no known secondary/reservoir hosts or vectors [6]. Here, we show that abundant corallicolid sequences are recovered from bearded fireworms (Hermodice carunculata) in tropical reef habitats off Curacao, and that they are distinct from corallicolids infecting the corals on which the fireworms were feeding at the time of their collection. The data are consistent with an active infection of fireworms, as opposed to corallicolids being a byproduct of feeding on infected corals, and we propose that H. carunculata is potentially a vector moving corallicolids between coral hosts through its faeces. These findings not only expand our understanding of the ecological interactions within coral reef ecosystems but also highlight the potential role of host-associated parasites in shaping the resilience of reef habitats.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

However, concerns remain that increased telehealth availability may contribute to higher overall healthcare utilization and spending. To assess telehealth's impact on outpatient evaluation and management (E&M) visit volume, we compared overall E&M utilization before and after the pandemic across specialties with varying levels of telehealth use. Methods: We analyzed 100% Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims to compare monthly outpatient E&M visit rates between two periods: pre-pandemic (January 2019-February 2020) and post-pandemic (January 2021-June 2024). Specialties were categorized by telehealth use as high (behavioral health), medium (primary care), and low (orthopedic surgery). A difference-in-differences (DID) analysis was used to assess changes in visit volume associated with telehealth. Results: Prior to the pandemic, telehealth accounted for just 0.1% of monthly E&M visits but surged to 41.0% in April 2020 before stabilizing between 5.7% and 7.0% in 2023-2024. The average monthly E&M visit rate per 1,000 FFS beneficiaries was 906.8 pre-pandemic and 918.6 post-pandemic. In the post-pandemic period, telehealth comprised 1.2% of E&M visits in low-use specialties, 8.4% in medium-use specialties, and 43.8% in high-use specialties. Compared to the expected trend based on the low telehealth-use specialty, high and medium telehealth-use specialties experienced a 4.1% and 7.2% relative decline in overall E&M visits, respectively, in the post-pandemic period. Conclusion: Following an initial surge, telehealth use stabilized in 2021 and beyond. Overall outpatient utilization remained stable post-pandemic, and increased telehealth adoption was not associated with a rise in total outpatient E&M visits. These findings suggest that broad telehealth adoption has not led to increased healthcare utilization among Medicare FFS beneficiaries.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349

The evolutionary association of mobile elements with host-beneficial genes is known to be hindered by the stability of chromosomal loci and competition with mobile elements lacking accessory genes. Using a mathematical model that incorporates these constraints, we identify two key mechanisms that help overcome these barriers, resulting in the evolutionary linkage of accessory genes, like virulence genes, to prophages. First, we show that migration in between bacterial populations favours this linkage when the gene is beneficial in an environment where prophage induction is also upregulated. Second, we show that within-population spatial dynamics also promotes the association of weakly selected genes and phages. Here, virion dispersal allows phage-encoded genes to spread into patches of bacteria lacking the gene, giving them a selective advantage over immobile chromosomal genes. While both of these mechanisms are evidently applicable to phages, this is less clear for plasmids and other mobile elements. This helps to resolve the long-standing question of why phages, rather than other mobile genetic elements, appear to frequently carry virulence genes as cargo. By demonstrating how spatial heterogeneity and phage lifecycle dynamics drive gene association, our work provides new insights into the evolution of phage-encoded pathogenicity and bacterial adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

Such efforts have primarily been implemented at the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), providing data for large resident populations but hindering the ability to implement targeted interventions or follow-ups. Conversely, building-level wastewater data exhibits increased variability due to rapid daily population dynamics but allows for targeted follow-up interventions or mitigation efforts. Here, we implemented a three-site wastewater sampling strategy on our university-affiliated medical campus from May 2021 to March 2024, comprised of two distinct hospital quadrants and a primarily research laboratory and classroom building. We first addressed several limitations in implementing hospital-level wastewater surveillance by optimizing sampling frequency and laboratory techniques. We subsequently improved our ability to model SARS-CoV-2 case counts using wastewater data by performing sensitivity analyses on viral shedding assumptions and testing the utility of internal normalization factors for population size. Our unique infrastructure allowed us to detect intra-hospital dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and diversity and confirmed that direct sequencing of wastewater was able to capture corresponding clinical viral diversity. In contrast, research building wastewater sampling showed that for most non-residential settings, despite low overall viral loads, a threshold approach can still be used to identify peaks in cases or transmission amongst the general population. Our study expands on current wastewater surveillance practices by examining the utility of and best practices for upstream and particularly hospital settings, enabling the use of non-municipal, medium-scale wastewater testing to inform efforts for reducing the burden of COVID-19.

ImportanceSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance has been increasingly implemented to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most wastewater testing across the United States occurs at municipal wastewater treatment plants. Yet, this testing method could also be beneficial at non-municipal and non-residential sites, including hospitals, where wastewater data for SARS-CoV-2 signals and viral diversity could directly impact hospital practices to control its spread. We analyzed both hospital and non-residential research building wastewater over a three-year period to establish optimized methods for collecting and interpreting wastewater data at sites upstream of treatment plants. We found that even within a single hospital building, wastewater testing in different locations showed distinct signatures over time, which corresponded with data from patients hospitalized in those locations. This study provides a framework for the use of wastewater viral surveillance upstream of municipal treatment plants to enable targeted interventions to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349

These findings suggest that telehealth, when used as a substitute for office visits, may reduce overall Medicare spending.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349

Current approaches to diagnosis rely on histology, which exhibits wide diagnostic variability and lacks access to molecular phenotypes that may stratify therapeutic response. Here, we leverage image-based spatial transcriptomics at sub-cellular resolution in longitudinal human cardiac biopsies to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity in 62 adult and pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients during and following histologically-diagnosed rejection. Across 28 cell types, we identified significant differences in abundance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells across different biological classes of rejection (cellular, mixed, antibody-mediated). We observed a broad overlap in cellular transcriptional states across histologic rejection severity and biological class and significant heterogeneity within rejection severity grades that would qualify for immunomodulatory treatment. Individuals who had resolved rejection after therapy had a distinct transcriptomic profile relative to those with persistent rejection, including 216 genes across 6 cell types along pathways of inflammation, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, IFN/IFN{gamma} response, and TNF signaling. Spatial transcriptomics also identified genes linked to long-term prognostic outcomes post-HT. These results underscore importance of subtyping immunologic states during rejection to stratify immune-cardiac interactions following HT that are therapeutically relevant to short- and long-term rejection-related outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

Methods: We used weighted data from the YRBS for 2011-2023 (n=110,409). We explored the impact of declining school and student response rates, missing data, and shifts in age distribution in 2021 on reported sexual intercourse. Using statistical decomposition, we estimated the percentage change in this outcome between 2019 and 2021 due to change in the age structure versus changes in reported behavior. Results: From 2011 and 2023, school and student survey response rates declined (school 81% to 40%, student 87% to 71%, and overall, 71% to 35%). Missing data on ever had sex increased over time from 7.0% in 2011 to 29.5% in 2019 and 19.8% in 2023. The age structure in the YRBS national sample was similar from 2011-2019 and in 2023, but substantially younger in 2021. Statistical decomposition estimated that 50% of the change in sexual experience among adolescent women between 2019 and 2021 and 30% of the change for adolescent men was due to a change in the age distribution. Implications: Declining response rates, increased missing data, and changes in the age structure of 2021 YRBS raise serious concerns about the validity of trends in the YRBS. A concerted national effort is needed to build support for the collection of YRBS and other public health surveillance data.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349

Small population sizes and the lack of recombination are two such scenarios that reduce the efficiency of selection. Under these conditions, the disconnect between deleterious genetic load and individual fitness due to the masking of recessive deleterious mutations in heterozygous individuals may result in the emergence of pseudo-overdominance, wherein the buildup of haplotypes with complementary sets of deleterious mutations results in apparent heterozygote advantage and an increase in linked neutral diversity. In polyploids, the presence of additional allelic copies magnifies this masking effect and may therefore increase the probability of pseudo-overdominance. Here, we simulate the evolution of small diploid and autotetraploid populations to identify the conditions that support the evolution of pseudo-overdominance. We discover that pseudo-overdominance evolves under a much wider range of parameters in autotetraploids than in diploids with identical population sizes, and that in many parts of parameter space there is an inverse relationship between fitness and recombination rate. These results imply that pseudo-overdominance may be more common than previously thought. We conclude by discussing the current evidence for pseudo-overdominance in species with polyploid histories, as well as its implications in agriculture due to the prevalence of polyploidy in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

This study investigates the Bermin crater lake species flock in Cameroon, comprising thirteen (nine valid and four undescribed) Coptodon species, to explore the effects of deep-water light environments on visual evolution. We analyzed visual opsin genes and their expression using 109 retina transcriptomes, focusing on differences among species at varying depths, and seasonal changes in the visual system of a seasonally migrating species. All species exhibit a multichromatic system with at least five cone opsins. While opsin sequence variability among species was minimal due to the flock's evolutionary youth, opsin expression patterns varied significantly. Deep-water species showed reduced SWS1 and SWS2B expression, consistent with diminished UV-to-violet light in deeper waters. Unexpectedly, we observed increased proportional expression of the red-sensitive LWS opsin gene, contrary to trends seen in other lacustrine fishes. Additionally, in the seasonally deep-dwelling species Coptodon imbriferna, opsin expression varied plastically between the rainy (shallow) and dry (deep) seasons, with reduced SWS2B expression when the fish reside in the deeper habitats. To add context of other cichlid systems and to explore shared patterns of molecular adaptation, we compared Bermin cichlids to the deep-water species of the Barombi Mbo crater lake. Both cases exemplify independent evolution of deep-water species, yet their visual systems adapted similarly in the single cones (less UV- and violet-sensitive and more blue-sensitive cones), whereas differently in the long-wavelength sensitive double cones (LWS expression lost in Barombi while increased in Bermin). Overall, our study focuses on an evolutionarily young example of cichlid adaptive radiation, providing a unique opportunity to examine the initial phases of molecular adaptation in visual systems.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

To address these obstacles, we present the DASH assembly toolset, which combines features of Golden Gate-based cloning, recombineering, and site-specific recombinase systems. We developed (1) a set of donor vectors based on the GoldenBraid platform, (2) an acceptor vector derived from the plant transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, and (3) a re-engineered recombineering-ready E. coli strain, CZ105, based on SW105. The initial assembly steps are carried out using the donor vectors following standard GoldenBraid assembly procedures. Importantly, existing parts and transcriptional units created using compatible Golden Gate-based systems can be transferred to the DASH donor vectors using standard single-tube restriction/ligation reactions. The cargo DNA from a DASH donor vector is then efficiently transferred in vivo in E. coli into the acceptor vector by the sequential action of a rhamnose-inducible phage-derived PhiC31 integrase and arabinose-inducible yeast-derived Flippase (FLP) recombinase using CZ105. Furthermore, recombineering-based post-assembly modification, including the removal of undesirable scars, is greatly simplified. To demonstrate the utility of the DASH system, a 116 kb DNA construct harboring a 97 kb cargo consisting of 35 transcriptional units was generated. One of the CDSs in the final assembly was replaced through recombineering, and the in planta functionality of the entire construct was tested in both transient and stable transformants.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

To address this question, we combined super-resolution STED imaging of bifunctional lipid probes with mathematical modeling. Quantification of 10 different lipid species revealed significant differences in pit partitioning, ranging from slight enrichment to moderate exclusion. We find that the lipid asymmetry in the plasma membrane is sufficient to explain the observed trend. Taken together, our findings imply that clathrin-mediated endocytosis has a minor selectivity for cytoplasmic leaflet lipids, but overall does not significantly contribute to lipid sorting compared to non-vesicular trafficking. More broadly, we believe that lipid super-resolution imaging will be a powerful approach to quantify lipid partitioning into membrane structures in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

However, the pattern of multiple waves per year that has been so disruptive and unique to COVID-19 cannot be explained by seasonal forcing.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms form the vast majority of genetic variation and play critical roles in complex, polygenic phenotypes, yet their functional impact is poorly understood from traditional gene-level analyses. In-depth knowledge on the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms has broad applications in health and disease, population genomic or evolution studies. The wealth of genomic data and available functional genetic tools make Drosophila melanogaster an ideal model species for studies at single nucleotide resolution. However, to leverage these resources and potentially combine it with the power of functional genetics to enhance genotype-phenotype research, it is essential to develop techniques to predict functional impact and causality of single nucleotide variants. Here, we present FlyCADD, a functional impact prediction tool for single nucleotide variants in D. melanogaster. FlyCADD, based on the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) framework, integrates over 650 genomic features - including conservation scores, GC content, and DNA secondary structure - into a single metric reflecting a variants predicted impact on evolutionary fitness. FlyCADD provides impact prediction scores for any single nucleotide variant on the D. melanogaster genome. We demonstrate FlyCADDs utility with some examples of application, including the ranking of phenotype-associated variants to prioritize variants for follow-up studies, evaluation of naturally occurring polymorphisms, and refining of CRISPR-Cas9 experimental design. FlyCADD provides a powerful framework for interpreting impact of any single nucleotide variant in D. melanogaster, thereby improving our understanding of genotype-phenotype connections.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

Its widespread use for basic research and biotechnological applications is, however, hampered by low efficiencies of current ncAA incorporation strategies. We uncover poor cellular ncAA uptake as a main obstacle to efficient genetic code expansion and overcome this bottleneck by hijacking a bacterial membrane transporter to actively import isopeptide-linked ncAAs within easily synthesizable tripeptide- scaffolds. Using this approach, we enable efficient encoding of eleven previously inaccessible ncAAs, decorating proteins with bioorthogonal and crosslinker moieties, posttranslational modifications, and functionalities for chemoenzymatic conjugation. To enhance scalability of protein production, we evolve the membrane transporter for preferential import of isopeptide- linked tripeptides, creating a novel Escherichia coli strain that facilitates single and multi-site ncAA incorporation with wild type efficiencies. Additionally, we adapt the tripeptide-scaffolds for co-transport of two different ncAAs, enabling their efficient dual incorporation. This work underscores the importance of optimizing ncAA-uptake for high-yielding production of modified proteins and will accelerate the development of generalizable transport systems, aiding incorporation of non-canonical building blocks to broaden the chemical space of proteins without the need to design for passive membrane permeability.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

We evaluated five pseudo-absence sampling techniques, considering pseudo-absence ratios, buffer radii, and density smoothing factors to determine the most effective modeling approach. Key environmental predictors included humidity, agricultural land-use, and forest cover, while temperature had minimal influence for both the virus and the vector. The resulting suitability model identifies high transmission risk areas in Central and South America, and reveals that environmental suitability patterns align with seasonal fluctuations in case numbers, with peaks in Amazonian states at the beginning of the year and an expansion into non-Amazonian regions later in the year.

First, the IC synthase (ICS) catalyzes the isomerization of chorismate to IC in chloroplasts. Second, the chloroplast-localized MATE transporter EDS5 appears to transport IC from chloroplasts to the cytosol. Cytosolic IC is then further converted to SA via the GH3 amino acid-conjugating enzyme PBS3. While this pathway is genetically well-characterized in A. thaliana, its evolutionary origin and conservation remain controversial. In this study, through comprehensive phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that the IC pathway emerged within the Brassicales order in a time span between the divergence of Carica papaya and Capparis spinosa. The evolution of the IC pathway was driven by three key adaptations during the time span: (1) enhancement of ICS activity, (2) neofunctionalization of EDS5 after duplication of its ancestral gene, and (3) evolution of PBS3, whose activity is specialized for glutamate-conjugation to IC. Structural modeling and functional assays reveal that an enhanced salt bridge network in ICS enhanced its activity. One of the duplicated genes, EDS5, acquired key amino acid substitutions in the C-lobe, which likely contributed to the new function as the IC transporter. In addition, the functional PBS3 clade, including A. thaliana PBS3, is restricted to a Brassicales clade. Taken together, this study addresses the evolutionary trajectory of IC-based SA biosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

However, the resulting digestate remains underutilized and its long-term environmental impact is uncertain. Traditional disposal methods are costly and inefficient, underscoring the need for more sustainable approaches. In this study, olive pomace digestate was biorefined and its components were upcycled into soil amendments and plant immunostimulants. Metagenomic analysis revealed a diverse microbial community in the liquid fraction, including Luteimonas, Pseudomonas, and Caldicoprobacter. We obtained a MIcrobial Protein Extract (MIPE) from digestate, containing precursors of microbe- and damage-associated molecular patterns. Treatment with MIPE triggered a rapid plant immune response, characterized by increased hydrogen peroxide production, phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the upregulation of defense-related genes. MIPE-induced priming enhanced Arabidopsis and tomato resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae. Our findings highlight digestate as a source of bioelicitors, offering a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides while enhancing plant immunity, valorizing olive mill waste and promoting sustainable agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

While group-level gradient patterns are well-characterized, the biological mechanisms underlying individual variability remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate genetic, transcriptomic, and metabolic data across large-scale cohorts to investigate the biological basis of functional gradients and their relevance to neuropsychiatric conditions. Using twin-based heritability analyses and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in over 30,000 individuals based on three datasets, we identified consistent heritability patterns and five genetic loci associated with gradient organization. These loci are linked to sixteen genes involved in metabolic pathways, with gene expression patterns spatially correlating with functional gradients. Furthermore, we observed significant associations between cardiovascular metabolic biomarkers and gradient architecture. Polygenic risk scores for neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder, were significantly associated with gradient loadings, suggesting shared genetic influences on functional organization and mental health risk. Our findings highlight a complex interplay between genetic variation, metabolic processes, and brain function, offering new insights into the biological foundations of functional brain organization and its implications for neuropsychiatric vulnerability.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349

Social withdrawal due to information overload was often described in ASD, and it was suspected that increased basal noise, i.e., excessive background neuronal activities in the brain could be a disease mechanism. However, experimental test of this hypothesis is limited. Loss-of-function mutations (deficiency) in SCN2A, which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, have been revealed as a leading monogenic cause of profound ASD. Here, we revealed that Scn2a deficiency results in robust and multifaceted social impairments in mice. Scn2a-deficient neurons displayed an increased excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio, contributing to elevated basal neuronal noise and diminished signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during social interactions. Notably, the restoration of Scn2a expression in adulthood is able to rescue both SNR and social deficits. By balancing the E/I ratio and reducing basal neuronal firing, an FDA-approved GABAA receptor-positive allosteric modulator improves sociability in Scn2a-deficient mice and normalizes neuronal activities in translationally relevant human brain organoids carrying autism-associated SCN2A nonsense mutation. Collectively, our findings revealed a critical role of the NaV1.2 channel in the regulation of social behaviors, and identified molecular, cellular, and circuitry mechanisms underlying SCN2A-associated disorders.

Recent advances in protein structure prediction with AlphaFold offer a promising approach to fill this gap in structural diversity in non-model systems. This study used AlphaFold to predict the structures of the D1 protein, the core subunit of photosystem II, across a broad range of photosynthetic organisms. The prediction produced high-confidence structures, and structural alignment analyses highlighted conserved regions across the different D1 groups, which were in line with high pLDDT scoring regions. In contrast, varying pLDDT in the DE loop and terminal regions appear to correlate with different degrees of structural flexibility or disorder. Subsequent structural phylogenetic analysis provided a phylogeny that is in good agreement with previous sequence-based studies. Moreover, the phylogeny supports a parsimonious scenario in which far-red D1 and D1INT evolved from the ancestral form of G4 D1. This study demonstrates the potential of AlphaFold in studies on structural diversity and the evolution of photosynthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

This flexibility relies on network interactions encompassing premotor and prefrontal regions, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). However, the dynamic interplay between these regions during action preparation and execution based on contextual demands remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that contextual information is encoded in SMA and rIFG interareal connectivity before action. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) during Go/No-Go tasks with varying target probabilities, we found that, during the preparatory stages of action, -band rIFG connectivity increased in contexts where motor responses were more frequently withheld. In contrast, SMA exhibited a reversed pattern only near the target onset. Finally, {beta}-band connectivity encoded proactive inhibition processes, increasing when action likelihood was low. Accordingly, during response implementation, both areas exhibited greater {beta}-band connectivity when action was withheld compared to when a motor response was required, further supporting its role in inhibitory control. Our results demonstrate that - and {beta}-band oscillatory network dynamics support context-sensitive adaptations, illustrating how premotor and prefrontal regions synergistically modulate their interactions as they transition from preparation to response. These findings advance understanding of how the brain integrates predictive information to dynamically organize motor and cognitive resources before an action unfolds, revealing that connectivity encodes critical information driving behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

In many species, this is accomplished by primordial germ cells (PGCs), which give rise to sperm or eggs. PGCs are often specified far from the future gonads and must migrate through developing tissues to reach them. Failure to do so can result in infertility or germ cell tumours. While PGC migration is well characterized in some species, very little is known about their migration in mammalian embryos. Here, we performed dynamic and quantitative analyses of PGC migration from E7.5 to E9.5 in the mouse embryo, providing the first comprehensive study of the migratory characteristics of PGCs from their point of origin to the gonads. We demonstrate that migrating PGCs are influenced by the surrounding environment and, in contrast to other organisms, extend highly dynamic, actin-rich protrusions to navigate through ECM barriers and tight intercellular spaces. As PGCs migrate through increasingly confined spaces, they undergo significant nuclear deformation and become prone to nuclear rupture and DNA damage. Their migration under confinement may be aided in part by a depleted nuclear lamina that leads to wrinkled nuclear morphology. Our high-resolution and dynamic imaging approaches have uncovered a surprising risk to genome integrity in migrating PGCs, with implications for DNA repair and adaptations in nuclear mechanics in PGCs.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

It is typically stored as a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM), whose elements are pairwise relatedness values between individuals. This relatedness has been defined in various contexts based on pedigree, genotype, phylogeny, coalescent times, and, recently, ancestral recombination graph (ARG). ARG-based GRMs have been found to better capture the structure of a population and improve association studies relative to the genotype GRM. However, calculating GRMs and further operations with them is fundamentally challenging due to inherent quadratic time and space complexity. Here, we first discuss the different definitions of relatedness in a unifying context, making use of the additive model of a quantitative trait to provide a definition of branch relatedness and the corresponding branch GRM. We explore the relationship between branch relatedness and pedigree relatedness through a case study of French-Canadian individuals that have a known pedigree. Through the tree sequence encoding of an ARG, we then derive an efficient algorithm for computing products between the branch GRM and a general vector, without explicitly forming the branch GRM. This algorithm leverages the sparse encoding of genomes with the tree sequence and hence enables large-scale computations with the branch GRM. We demonstrate the power of this algorithm by developing a randomized principal components algorithm for tree sequences that easily scales to millions of genomes. All algorithms are implemented in the open source tskit Python package. Taken together, this work consolidates the different notions of relatedness as branch relatedness and by leveraging the tree sequence encoding of an ARG it provides efficient algorithms that enable computations with the branch GRM that scale to mega-scale genomic datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1741385129349

DesignRetrospective online survey. The survey was co-designed with Long COVID patients and carers.

SettingRespondents were recruited from representative online panels in the U.S. and U.K. maintained by the data firm Dynata in early 2024.

ParticipantsAfter data cleaning, the final dataset comprised 1,816 respondents, 352 (19.4%) who reported Long COVID and 1,464 (80.6%) who did not.

Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe primary outcome was self-reported Long COVID, defined as experiencing symptoms related to a COVID-19 infection at least three months after the infection began. Participants were also asked to indicate whether they experienced no, mild or severe initial symptoms during each COVID-19 infection and to respond to nine questions that assessed different aspects of hypermobility: the Hakim and Grahame 5-part questionnaire (5PQ) and four additional co-produced questions. The 5PQ was used to identify individuals with generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). All nine questions were used to develop a measure of extreme hypermobility, based on the top 10th percentile of hypermobility among respondents in each of six groups sorted by age and gender.

ResultsIn separate binomial logistic regressions of the dataset controlling for sex assigned at birth, age, number of infections, and number of vaccine doses, both GJH (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65) and extreme hypermobility (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.16) were found to be predictive of Long COVID. Hypermobility influences the odds of getting Long COVID through two pathways. First, both GJH and extreme hypermobility increase the risk that individuals with no or moderate initial symptoms from a COVID-19 infection experience Long COVID. Second, both GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant predictors of developing severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID-19 infection(s), which is independently associated with increased Long COVID risk. A mediation analysis confirmed that extreme hypermobility influences the odds of developing Long COVID in part by increasing the likelihood that individuals experience severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID infection(s).

ConclusionsBoth GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant risk factors for Long COVID. People with extreme hypermobility are at particularly high risk of developing Long COVID after an initial COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to replicate these findings with other datasets and clarify the pathophysiology that explains why people with hypermobility may be at greater risk of Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349

By aggregating gene expression profiles from millions of cells across hundreds of studies, single cell atlases have provided a foundation for training AI-driven models of the cell. However, reliance on datasets with pre-processed counts limits the size and diversity of these repositories and constrains downstream model training to data curated for divergent purposes. This introduces analytical variability due to differences in the choice of alignment tools, genome references, and counting strategies.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1741385129349
