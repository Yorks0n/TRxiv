Using single-cell multiomics data for the cerebellum from human, macaque, marmoset, and mouse, we revealed that TE contributions to different cell types are shaped by differences in evolutionary constraint across cell types, as well as the preferential co-option of certain TEs in specific cell states. Using a sequence-based deep-learning model predicting cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility, we systematically assessed the co-option potential of TEs into cerebellar gene regulatory networks, identifying seventeen TE fragments with complex regulatory sequences in their ancestral states that facilitate their co-option as cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements. Primate-specific HERVL (human endogenous retrovirus L) is predominantly accessible in differentiating granule cells and other rhombic-lip-derived neuroblasts during hindbrain development, and contributes to species-specific gene expression patterns. Our study uncovers a pivotal role for TEs in the evolution of the cerebellum. More generally, it demonstrates how TEs can be directly co-opted into the gene regulatory networks of specific cell types and introduces a generalizable analytical framework for dissecting their contribution to mammalian regulatory evolution.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

How enhancers specifically activate their target promoter while bypassing other promoters remains unclear. Here, we find that the promoter-proximal region is critical for cell-type specific enhancer-promoter compatibility. Using high-throughput genome-engineering in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), we systematically replace the endogenous Sox9 promoter with different libraries of core and extended (i.e. full) promoters and assess their response to long-range regulatory elements in mESCs and neural progenitor cells. We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters. Our results suggest that within multipartite regulatory domains, the promoter-proximal region fulfills a facilitator-like function that filters and transmits signal from distal enhancers, ultimaltely conferring enhancer-promoter compatibility.","[{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101076709;101125530;813327;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IB 139/6-1;KR 5247/1-1;KR 5247/1-2;KR 5247/1-3;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

We introduce the BirdsPlus Index (BPI), a novel, scalable approach that integrates monitoring data, remote sensing, and conservation-weighted species scores to quantify deviations of observed site scores from spatiotemporally explicit expectations. Using nearly 29,000 recordings from the Macaulay Library, we generated acoustic checklists with the Merlin and BirdNET sound identification models under multiple detection thresholds. We matched these acoustic checklists with species-specific conservation values (BirdsPlus species scores), then trained random forest models to predict total, site-level biodiversity (the sum of these species scores) given environmental and effort covariates. The resulting model also enabled us to map expected BirdsPlus site scores across the landscape.

These scores integrate information on species conservation status, ecological roles, and phylogenetic and functional uniqueness. BPI was calculated as the residual between observed and expected site scores, thereby providing a direct site-level measure of conservation value. Across 30 sites, we found that BPI values were consistent across acoustic models and detection thresholds, with high-scoring sites supporting regionally uncommon breeders and habitat specialists. While acoustic- and observer-based (eBird) models showed differing spatial patterns, both aligned with known ecological drivers such as urban density, elevation, and wetland cover. Our results demonstrate that acoustic checklists can be used to model expected biodiversity over time and space, and that the BPI provides a robust, interpretable metric for evaluating the ecological integrity of local sites. Beyond its immediate application to conservation planning, this framework lays the foundation for global, real-time biodiversity monitoring that leverages automated acoustic classifiers, citizen science, and remote sensing to integrate conservation value into development and management decisions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Here, we identify the PRC2 accessory protein AEBP2 as a specific genetic dependency in EZH2-mutant DLBCL. While AEBP2 acts through PRC2, its essential role is surprisingly independent of canonical H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing. Instead, AEBP2 functions within a PRC2.2 complex lacking JARID2, using its zinc-finger domains to sample intergenic chromatin to sustain H3K27me2. Notably, loss of AEBP2 or NSD2 caused contrasting changes in intergenic H3K27me2 levels, driving sensitivity or resistance to PRC2 inhibitors, respectively. Our findings identify AEBP2-PRC2.2-maintained intergenic H3K27me2 as a therapeutic vulnerability in EZH2-mutant DLBCL and highlight dysregulated H3K27me2 as an underappreciated form of PRC2 dysfunction in cancer, with important therapeutic implications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors5. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers6. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring7,8. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors9. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the emerging clonal raider ant neuroscience community and reveals novel features of the species neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99DC021506;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE 194642;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Conventional transformation methods rely on purified DNA and physical force to drive uptake into the chloroplast, often resulting in DNA shearing and thus low transfer efficiency for large constructs. Bacterial conjugation offers an attractive alternative as this is an entirely in vivo process, enabling DNA transfer without any physical manipulation. To assess the feasibility of this approach, we attempted to generate an Escherichia coli donor strain carrying both the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pTA-Mob (52.7 kb) and the cloned Phaeodactylum tricornutum chloroplast genome (pPt_Cp, 132.9 kb). Unexpectedly, pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp proved incompatible: co-maintenance could not be achieved via electroporation, and conjugation with a self-transmissible pTA-Mob variant resulted in a ~10-fold decrease in transfer efficiency. Systematic testing of pTA-Mob and pPt_Cp plasmid variants as well as sequence analysis of evolved transconjugants revealed that the incompatibility arose from the pBBR1 replicon present in pTA-Mob. Guided by these insights, we identified an alternative conjugative plasmid, pRL443, that was compatible with pPt_Cp. Together, these findings provide a framework for dissecting plasmid incompatibility when working with large constructs and establish a functional conjugative system capable of mobilizing the P. tricornutum chloroplast genome.","[{""name"":""Advanced Research + Invention Agency (ARIA)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PROP-PR01-P003;""},{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN-2025-05428;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Homeostasis involves not only reactive feedback but also anticipatory adjustments shaped by experience. Prior homeostatic reinforcement learning (HRL) models have provided a computational account of anticipatory regulation under homeostatic challenges. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for gradual, trial-by-trial adjustment and for extinction learning. To address this issue, we developed a continuous HRL framework that enables trial-wise tuning of anticipatory regulation. The model incorporates biologically informed components: asymmetric reinforcement, weighting negative outcomes more than positive outcomes; and a dual-unit, context-gated inhibitory mechanism. We applied the framework to thermoregulatory conditioning with ethanol-induced hypothermia and successfully reproduced cue-triggered compensation, gradual tolerance, and rapid reacquisition after extinction. We then extended the framework to multiple physiological variables influenced by shared neural or hormonal control signals, and found that when regulatory priorities across variables were uneven, a deviation in one variable propagated through shared control to others, yielding a cascading, system-wide failure to return to ideal state (non-recovery); a pattern reminiscent of autonomic dysregulation (e.g., dysautonomia, ME/CFS). Overall, our framework provides a computational basis to advances a systems-level understanding of multi-organ homeostatic dysregulation in vivo.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23KJ1293;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJMS2024-9;""},{""name"":""Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004rtk039"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP25wm0625322;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Here, we investigate mechanisms of salt spray adaptation by comparing five latitudinal pairs of monkeyflower accessions locally adapted to coastal and inland habitats. We measured sodium levels in coastal and inland leaves exposed to experimental salt spray in the lab, and compared leaf surface traits that may contribute to differences in sodium uptake between ecotypes. Coastal monkeyflowers take up less sodium through the leaf surface under experimental salt spray, which may contribute to local adaptation under oceanic salt spray in coastal habitats. Higher water content per unit leaf area and less water loss under salt spray further reduce sodium concentrations in salt-sprayed coastal leaves compared to inland counterparts. Our results suggest that plant adaptation to coastal habitats may often involve the evolution of multiple mechanisms to survive stress imposed by oceanic salt spray.","[{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DGE-184-8739;IOS-2153100;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

In Arabidopsis thaliana, submergence elicits a leaf-age dependent phenotype in which senescence and death progress across an age gradient starting with older leaves. Here we sought to investigate the mechanisms mediating this observed differential flood resilience by interrogating leaf age-specific transcriptome and proteome changes during submergence and recovery. Following submergence, most age-dependent differences were in the magnitude or speed of transcript abundance changes, whereas qualitative leaf-age dependent responses were most apparent during recovery. This included a strong desiccation response in old leaves despite a stronger ABA-signaling response. Physiological measurements suggested that faster dehydration was facilitated by a combination of submergence-mediated reduction of ABA sensitivity and higher conductance in old leaves. We also observed a stronger induction in young shoot tissue of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR). Mutants disabled in the two UPR signaling branches were affected in new leaf formation and the ability to restore the proteome, but not in senescence, suggesting that young tissues activate ER stress recovery to permit continuation of growth. Of the mitochondrial membrane proteins differentially regulated in young leaves, loss of mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel function impacted submergence-recovery tolerance. Our data reveal multiple mechanisms underlying leaf age-dependent differential submergence recovery and demonstrate how tolerance is determined by an interplay between age related developmental traits and stress signaling pathways.","[{""name"":""NWO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALWOP.419; OCENW.M20.197; 016.Vidi.171.006; OCENW.M.24.182;""},{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21 ROMITIGATION FUND (BB/W510543/1);Green Engineering Institute Strategic Programme Grant (BB/X010988/1);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Together, these findings redefine the landscape of MOR allosteric modulation by revealing a novel binding site, a potentially lipid-sensitive allosteric mechanism, and the molecular wiring of long-range communication within MOR. This work provides a new molecular framework for the rational design of PAMs targeting opioid receptors with improved precision and possible therapeutic potential.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA058681;R01DA063209;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Sebum-based diagnostic methods using commercial oil-blotting films have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 detection in humans, yet equivalent strategies for veterinary use remain largely unexplored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), presents a major health threat in Asia--especially in Japan, where multiple cases of cat-to-veterinarian transmission have been reported. To address the need for safer diagnostics, we sought to establish a sebum-based RNA virus detection method for cats. We designed primers that efficiently detected RNA from feline sebum while distinguishing it from human and feline DNA/RNA. Using this platform, we determined the ear to be the optimal sebum collection site and confirmed that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA can be reliably identified from ear sebum with sensitivity comparable to conventional blood-based testing. In addition, we detected SFTSV RNA from sebum samples of infected cat. Our findings introduce a minimally invasive, safe diagnostic platform for feline viral infections, reducing animal distress while safeguarding veterinarians and pet owners from zoonotic risks. This strategy marks an important step toward realizing the One Health framework by advancing the well-being of both animals and humans.","[{""name"":""Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""G-7 Grants"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ito Foundation Research Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Kao Corporation (Japan)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/016t1kc57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a memory of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating multi-omics, histology, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD+ and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2 was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy.

A key player in the delivery of vesicles to the early Golgi is p115 (USO1), a homodimer with a folded head domain and a coiled-coil tail that is anchored to Golgi membranes. p115 has been shown to capture vesicles and to bind to SNARE proteins to promote membrane fusion. Here we report that the head domain of human p115 can bind directly to Sec16A, a large scaffolding protein that organises ER sites and promotes COPII vesicle formation. Structural prediction and deletion mapping define the region of interaction to a conserved motif in the unstructured N-terminal region of Sec16A, and mutations in p115 that block motif binding reduce the efficiency of secretion. This interaction could potentially allow a subset of p115 molecules to reach across from the early Golgi to the ER exit sites to contribute to the large-scale organisation of the early secretory pathway.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_U105178783;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/W005905/1;UKRI715;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

We now present the connectome of the entire Drosophila male central nervous system. This contains 166,691 neurons spanning the brain and ventral nerve cord, fully proofread and comprehensively annotated including fruitless and doublesex expression and 11,691 cell types. By comparison with a previous female brain connectome, we provide the first comprehensive description of the differences between male and female brains to synaptic resolution. Of 7,319 cross-matched cell types in the central brain, 114 are dimorphic with an additional 262 male- and 69 female-specific (totalling 4.8% of neurons in males and 2.4% in females).

This resource enables analysis of full sensory-to-motor circuits underlying complex behaviours as well as the impact of dimorphic elements. Sex-specific and dimorphic neurons are concentrated in higher brain centres while the sensory and motor periphery are largely isomorphic. Within higher centres, male-specific connections are organised into hotspots defined by male-specific neurons or the presence of male-specific arbours on neurons that are otherwise similar between sexes.

The peptidoglycan (PG) fragments generated in this process are typically imported into the cell and recycled for entry into the PG biosynthesis pathway. While the underlying pathways have been studied intensively in gammaproteobacteria, knowledge of their presence and physiological roles in other bacterial lineages remains limited. Here, we comprehensively investigate PG recycling in the alphaproteobacterial model organism Caulobacter crescentus. We show that this species contains a functional PG recycling pathway by characterizing the activities of key enzymes in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that PG recycling is critical for C. crescentus cell morphology and division, and is dynamically regulated to balance the flux of metabolic intermediates toward PG biosynthesis and central carbon metabolism. Importantly, defects in PG recycling strongly impair the intrinsic ampicillin resistance of C. crescentus without changing the activity of its {beta}-lactamase BlaA, likely by limiting PG precursor biosynthesis and thereby decreasing the activity of the cell wall biosynthetic machinery in the presence of residual antibiotic. These findings underscore the central role of PG recycling in bacterial fitness and suggest that inhibiting this process could provide a promising strategy to combat {beta}-lactam-resistant pathogens.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

However, how thalamus-cortex interactions influence human cortical development remains unknown primarily because of the inaccessibility of the human embryonic brain. Here, we demonstrate thalamus-dependent gene expression, circuit organization, and neural activity during corticogenesis using human thalamocortical assembloids (hThCAs). Human cortical and thalamic organoids (hCOs and hThOs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited region-specific gene expression and spontaneous neuronal activity. Upon the fusion of these organoids, hThCAs reconstructed reciprocal thalamus-cortex axonal projections and synaptic connections. Transcriptomic analysis revealed thalamus-dependent acceleration of cortical maturation, with upregulation of programs linked to axon development, subplate/cortical plate identity, and activity-regulated genes. Histological analysis showed expanded progenitor pools and increased deep-layer neurons within hThCAs. Wide-field Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that wave-like activity originated in the thalamic region and propagated to the cortical region. Furthermore, two-photon Ca2+ imaging of cortical neurons revealed that synchronous activity emerged exclusively in pyramidal tract (PT) and corticothalamic (CT) neurons, whereas intratelencephalic (IT) neurons remain asynchronous, highlighting cell type-specific circuit integration within hThCAs. These synchronized events were absent in isolated hCOs or in cortico-cortical assembloids, underscoring the specificity of thalamic input. Our findings suggest that diffusible thalamic cues broadly enhance progenitor expansion, while long-range thalamic input organizes cell type-specific synchronous activity. This study demonstrates the thalamus-dependent acquisition of mature cortical phenotypes in a cell type-specific manner in hThCAs, establishing developmental mechanisms linking regional interactions and cell type-specific circuit specification. Thus, hThCAs provide a tractable human platform for dissecting human-specific developmental processes and modeling neurodevelopmental disorders with disrupted thalamocortical communication at the molecular, cellular, and circuit levels.

Using GPX1 and GPX4, selenoenzymes that mitigate oxidative stress, as reporters, we performed genome-wide knockout screens to identify regulators of selenocysteine incorporation. This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of 40 participants; 19 T2D, 16 healthy obese volunteers (HOV), 5 prediabetes, who underwent [18F]FP-(+)-DTBZ PET to quantify vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) density (SUVR-1), T1-weighted MRI for 3D morphology metric analysis, and an arginine stimulus test to measure acute (AIRarg) and maximum (AIRargMAX) insulin responses. Lasso regression models identified the optimal combination of PET, MRI, and clinical variables to predict beta-cell function for the whole pancreas and its subregions.

ResultsCompared to HOV, individuals with T2D exhibited significantly reduced AIRarg and AIRargMAX. Only pancreas body volume was significantly smaller in the T2D cohort. For the whole pancreas, a model including PET-derived SUVR-1 and a subset of clinical covariates best predicted acute beta-cell function (AIRarg). However, predicting maximum functional reserve (AIRargMAX) required the addition of MRI-based morphology metrics in combination with SUVR-1 and a subset of clinical covariates.

ConclusionWe combined PET imaging of BCM and MRI morphology metrics with a robust machine learning-based variable selection method to extract useful PET- and MRI-based metrics for predicting functional and not-fully functional BCM.

Here, we present METAHIT, an accessible and modular workflow that standardizes metaHi-C from raw reads to genome-resolved outputs. The pipeline provides alignment-derived, assumption-light quality checks, integrates three state-of-the-art Hi-C-based binners by consolidating their outputs into a single, non-redundant metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) set, and, for the first time, reuses informative intra-contig read pairs that other Hi-C workflows discard by identifying shotgun-like reads with an EM model on gap distances and using them for per-bin reassembly. METAHIT also supports Hi-C-guided scaffolding, focused visualizations for scaffold structure, MAG annotation, and mobile genetic element (MGE)-host interactions. Across six habitats spanning host-associated and environmental microbiomes, METAHIT increases the recovery of near-complete and high-quality MAGs relative to established Hi-C baselines, while per-bin reassembly lowers contamination and maintains completeness. Applied to a single sheep-gut long-read metaHi-C sample, METAHIT recovered 929 high-quality genomes, representing, to our knowledge, the highest species richness reported from a single sample, and revealed expanded diversity within Erysipelotrichales. In the human gut, METAHIT improved contiguity for an abundant Bacteroides vulgatus MAG via Hi-C-guided scaffolding, identified candidate novel Faecalibacterium lineages, and resolved MGE-host links involving F. prausnitzii and the novel Faecalibacterium MAG.

Here, we introduce MANGO (MANufacturing on the GO), a purpose-built, open-source device designed for automated, benchtop cell-free protein synthesis and purification. Computer-controlled synthesis and purification are mediated through biomedical-grade pumps, valves, and a microchannel manifold, enabling rapid protein production directly at the point-of-use. To demonstrate MANGO's utility, we produced and validated a diverse range of proteins, including nanobodies against SARS-CoV-2 and TNF, cloning enzymes, and diagnostic enzymes, with performance equivalent to their commercial counterparts. We further deployed MANGO in Brazil and Colombia to support patient trials for SARS-CoV-2 and dengue virus diagnostics. These results establish MANGO as a low-cost, portable platform that can democratize access to bioreagents in both high- and low-resource settings and, ultimately, expand participation in the bioeconomy.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760825324320

Here, we generated a 1.45-billion-contact Micro-C map of cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that resolves [~]4,600 loops, seven times more than previous Hi-C data. Loop anchors segregate into two epigenetic classes: 1) promoter-centered loops with anchors enriched for RNA polymerase II, accessible chromatin, active histone modifications, and 2) loops with anchors enriched for Polycomb-linked or heterochromatic signatures. Both classes strongly repel young Gypsy retrotransposons, while retaining older copies directly at the anchor, revealing an age-selective filter. Unlike mammalian genome organization, loop anchors rarely overlap insulation boundaries, indicating that loop and domain formation are largely independent. Cross-species Micro-C in two wild tomatoes shows conserved anchor positions despite rapid sequence turnover. Integrating cross-species transcriptomics further reveals a dual regulatory role for promoter-anchored loops: they can enhance expression when paired with activating chromatin or poise/repress it via H3K27me3-rich, distal anchors. These data provide a high-resolution framework for interpreting plant gene regulation in 3D and a resource to probe how looping shapes trait variation and can be leveraged in breeding.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

This idea has been challenged by reports of ongoing neural activity in the alpha band during WM maintenance, however. The precise role of these alpha oscillations is unclear: Do they reflect attentional prioritization of stored information, or do they serve as a general maintenance mechanism, for instance to periodically refresh synaptic traces? To address this, we designed a visual WM task involving two memory items, one of which was prioritized for recall. The task included both a short (1 s) and a long (3 s) delay intervals between encoding and retrieval. The long delay was implemented to provide a more decisive test of WM maintenance, providing a point in time when any initially silent synaptic traces would likely need to be refreshed as well. Time-resolved decoding analyses revealed that both prioritized and deprioritized items were initially decodable following stimulus presentation. However, only the prioritized item exhibited sustained decodability throughout the delay, particularly in the long delay condition, where it transitioned into a stable coding scheme. This prolonged representation was selectively supported by induced alpha power, which reliably tracked the prioritized item, but not the deprioritized one. Impulse-based decoding further confirmed this asymmetry, highlighting a selective reactivation of the deprioritized item only upon contextual relevance. Together, these findings suggest that sustained alpha-band activity reflects attentional prioritization, rather than general memory maintenance. Unattended, non-prioritized items appear to transition into an activity-silent state, consistent with models of synaptic storage in WM.","[{""name"":""China Scholarship Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04atp4p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""202106990030;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

In recent years, unexplained outbreaks characterized by marked egg-production decline have occurred in breeder duck flocks in China. To identify the causative agent, samples were collected from affected farms in multiple regions across China between 2022 and 2025. Representative samples were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, followed by phylogenetic analysis, transmission electron microscopy, host cell infection assays, and animal challenge experiments.

A previously unreported Orbivirus, designated Duck orbivirus (DORV), was identified. Epidemiological investigation indicated that outbreaks mainly affected breeder ducks during the peak laying period (21-55 weeks of age), with higher incidence in summer and autumn. The DORV genome contains ten double-stranded RNA segments encoding seven structural and five nonstructural proteins. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DORV is closely related to Parrys Lagoon virus (PLV) and Corriparta virus (CORV). Electron microscopy revealed icosahedral particles 30-40 nm in diameter. DORV replicated efficiently in DEF, DEL and C6/36 cells but not in MDCK and LMH cells, suggesting a restricted host range with potential arthropod-borne features. Infection of breeder ducks with DORV-SD01 reduced egg production by 30-40% and caused lesions in the ovary, liver, and spleen.

This study describes a novel duck-origin Orbivirus linked to egg-production decline, offering new etiological insights and extending the host spectrum of Orbivirus. The results provide a foundation for future surveillance and prevention of emerging waterfowl diseases.","[{""name"":""the National Key Research and Development Program of China"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2024YFF1000900;""},{""name"":""the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CAAS-ZDRW202501;""},{""name"":""the Agriculture Research System of China"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CARS-42-19;""},{""name"":""State Key Laboratory of Animal Biotech Breeding"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""XQSWYZQZ-JBKY-2;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Yet these interactions are also shaped by the broader environmental context in which they unfold, to appropriately align sexual arousal with reproductive opportunities. Here we show that in the host specialist Drosophila erecta mating is strictly contingent on the ecological and social environment generated as flies densely aggregate in groups on a food patch. We find that food volatiles directly promote male sexual arousal, triggering individuals to sample and pursue potential mates, giving rise to dynamic interactions across the group. The ensuing visual motion transforms each males visual field, which in turn further amplifies his arousal, generating a multisensory feedback loop that coordinately promotes courtship across individuals. D. erectas strict dependence on environmental cues appears latent in related species, such as D. melanogaster, where food odor can promote arousal but is dispensable for vigorous courtship. Comparative circuit analyses reveal that species-specific thresholds for sexual arousal reflect variation in how olfactory input modulates conserved nodes controlling courtship drive, rendering food volatiles a strict sensory gate only in D. erecta. Together, our findings highlight how ecological cues not directly tied to sexual signaling can profoundly influence reproductive behavior and reorganize the social landscape to ensure mating occurs in contexts where reproductive opportunities are abundant.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99GM151471;K99GM141319;T32GM152349;""},{""name"":""Helen Hay Whitney Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037ebw447"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35NS111611;""},{""name"":""Kavli Neural Systems Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Here, we used Drosophila melanogaster to investigate how bacterial microbiome composition affects pathogenesis of enteric RNA viruses. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum supplementation increased bacterial microbiome diversity without altering total bacterial load, while Acetobacter pomorum supplementation had minimal impact on the bacterial microbiome. L. plantarum-enriched flies exhibited an additional ~15% reduction in lifespan from Drosophila A virus (DAV) infection despite showing reduced viral protein accumulation and similar viral RNA levels. The reduction in tolerance to viral infection required live bacteria and was observed only for DAV, as no change in mortality was observed with Nora virus or Drosophila C virus infections. Mechanistic investigations revealed that tolerance reduction occurs independently of transcriptional immune responses, as DAV-infected flies showed similar transcriptional profiles regardless of bacterial microbiome composition. Intestinal barrier function assays demonstrated that L. plantarum-supplemented flies died before developing signs of gut barrier disruption, suggesting that extra-intestinal mechanisms contribute to mortality; this interpretation is further supported by similar levels of intestinal damage markers observed in virus-infected flies under both microbiome conditions. Viral genomic sequencing ruled out microbiome-driven selection of more pathogenic viral variants, as no adaptive mutations were observed between microbiome conditions that could account for the differential pathogenesis. These findings describe how subtle shifts in microbiome composition modulate viral infection outcomes through pathways that operate independently of canonical immune responses, viral evolution, and intestinal damage.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; encoded by Serpine1) is highly upregulated in endothelial cells after stroke. Since the primary function of PAI-1 is to inhibit fibrin clot breakdown, we hypothesized that blocking this pathway would be beneficial for recovery since it is expected to increase capillary blood flow after stroke. Using longitudinal in vivo imaging in mice subjected to ischemic stroke, we unexpectedly found that knockdown of Serpine1 in brain endothelial cells leads to a long-lasting reduction in peri-infarct capillary width, red blood cell velocity and flux. Conversely, stimulating this pathway in naive mice increased capillary width and blood flow. Lowered peri-infarct blood flow in Serpine1 knockdown mice attenuated deleterious blood brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory gene expression. Serpine1 knockdown improved the progressive recovery of sensory evoked cortical responses, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor function. These findings challenge the assumption that increased blood flow after stroke is better for recovery and reveal that carefully tuning flow, rather than maximizing it, may be optimal. Further our data highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting endothelial Serpine1/PAI-1 signalling in promoting stroke recovery.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

We generated and analyzed proteomic, epigenetic, and genetic data from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples of a uniquely APOEe4-enriched subset of the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Specifically, we generated DIA LC-MS proteomic data (n = 302), analyzed previously generated DNA methylation profiles from our group (n = 310), and used published whole-genome sequencing data (n = 254) to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this cohort, 69% (n = 214) were APOEe4 carriers, and 19.6% (n = 42) of them showed no pathological evidence of AD based on NIA-Reagan criteria, enabling identification of APOEe4-related risk and resilience mechanisms. In the absence of AD, APOEe4 carriers exhibited lower levels of 27 proteins, suggesting early synaptic (e.g., VAMP1, SYN3, CASKIN1) and metabolic (e.g., GLUD1, PI4KA) vulnerability. By contrast, APOEe4 carriers with AD displayed marked upregulation of inflammatory and proteostatic proteins (e.g., GNAO1, AHNAK, FGG, HEBP1, APEX1, RAB4A, SLC12A5, LRP1, BAG6) and hypermethylation of cg06329447 in ELAVL4. Network analyses highlighted convergent disruptions in synaptic transmission, metabolism, and proteostasis -- key pathways altered in APOEe4-associated AD. Mediation analyses identified GRIPAP1 and GSTK1 as top protein mediators (accounting for ~26-33% of APOEe4's effect), with VAMP1, CASKIN1, DPP3, SYN3, and FGG each contributing ~9-15%. ELAVL4 hypermethylation also mediated ~12% of the APOEe4 effect, linking epigenetic dysregulation to disease risk. To assess whether the identified proteins reflected broader genetic risk for AD or were specific to APOEe4, we calculated PRS both excluding and including the APOE genomic region. While the non-APOE PRS showed no association with identified molecular markers, the APOE-inclusive PRS was significantly associated with eight AD-related proteins in carriers, indicating they are not explained by polygenic risk outside of APOE. Finally, predictive modeling stratified by APOEe4 status revealed that in non-carriers, PRS most effectively classified AD (AUC = 0.73), whereas in carriers, proteomic and epigenetic markers outperformed PRS (AUC up to 0.74). Together, these findings demonstrate that APOEe4 confers AD risk through early synaptic and metabolic disruptions and later-stage inflammatory and epigenetic changes, laying the groundwork for genotype-tailored biomarker development and therapeutic strategies.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AG057912;S10OD02365101A1;S10OD019967;S10OD018034;P30AG10161;P30AG72975;R01AG17917;R01AG015819;U01AG072572;U01AG046152;""},{""name"":""Yale School of Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03pnmqc26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Comparisons across species show pervasive losses, gains, and functional remolding at tRNA loci, indicating rapid evolution over intermediate timescales, but the underlying molecular changes happening over short timescales remain poorly understood. A central gap in our understanding is the nature of deleterious tRNA mutations, how they affect fitness, and the extent to which tRNA pools vary functionally across genomes. Furthermore, new technologies for capturing tRNA expression and modification emphasize the importance of tRNA activity to organismal fitness, as tRNA dysregulation is associated with disease burden in humans, but this research area has not yet included possible consequences of mutational variation. To infer the dynamics of tRNA evolution over short timescales, and to integrate our understanding of fitness consequences of tRNA regulation with mutation load, we first require a comprehensive view of standing variation in cytosolic tRNAs within populations. In this study, we resolve within-species allelic variation in nuclear-encoded tRNAs in three nematode species: Caenorhabditis elegans, C. briggsae, and C. tropicalis. We show that these tRNA repertoires have been shaped by transcription-associated mutagenesis and selection and exhibit extensive allelic variation, including isotype switching between tRNA backbones and anticodons, and genomic organization and patterns of variation that differ markedly from those of protein-coding regions. Individual genomes harbor remarkably different pools of tRNA genes predicting a wide range tRNA functional complements within a species.","[{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EDGE 2319796;NSF-Simons Southeast Center for Mathematics and Biology (NSF DMS-1764406, Simons Foundation/SFARI 594594);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Among these, schizorhodopsins constitute a divergent family originally identified as inward proton pumps from Promethearchaeota (Asgard archaea). Here, we report that in addition to archaeal schizorhodopsins, many members of the family originate from bacteria and detail a comprehensive biophysical characterization of novel schizorhodopsins from Antarctic Minisyncoccota (Patescibacteria) and cyanobacteria, designated as paSzR and psSzR, respectively. Both proteins function as light-driven inward proton pumps, as confirmed through pH measurements in Escherichia coli cells. Laser-flash photolysis experiments identified multiple photointermediates (K, L, and M) characteristic of microbial rhodopsin photocycles, though with slower turnover rates compared to archaeal schizorhodopsins. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues in the third and sixth transmembrane helices demonstrates differential structural requirements between paSzR and psSzR. Our phylogenetic reconstruction reveals that most bacterial schizorhodopsins cluster in a single lineage distinct from archaeal variants. These findings significantly expand our understanding of microbial rhodopsin diversity and provide crucial insights into alternative molecular mechanisms for light-driven proton translocation, with implications for microbial ecology in extreme environments.

Statement of significanceSchizorhodopsins represent an unusual family of light-driven proteins that pump protons inwardly--opposite to the classical microbial rhodopsin pumps. Originally discovered in archaea, we revealed their unprecedented prevalence in bacteria. We characterized two novel bacterial schizorhodopsins from the Antarctic: paSzR from Minisyncoccota and psSzR from Cyanobacteriota, demonstrating their inward proton-pumping activity. Our phylogenetic reconstruction showed that most bacterial schizorhodopsins form a distinct evolutionary lineage and two exchange events between Minisyncoccota and cyanobacteria. Through targeted mutagenesis, we identified critical residues that govern spectral tuning and transport efficiency, revealing mechanistic differences between members of the family. These findings expand the known diversity of light-energy conversion mechanisms across microbial life and provide insights into alternative proton translocation strategies, with implications for understanding microbial adaptation to extreme environments.","[{""name"":""ERDF Andalusia Program 2021-2027"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""M.1.B.A TA_000618_UJA23;""},{""name"":""JSPS KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP23K21092, JP23K18090, JP23H04404, JP24H02268, and JP23K05007;""},{""name"":""JST CREST"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJCR22N2;""},{""name"":""MEXT Promotion of Development of a Joint Usage/ Research System Project: Coalition of Universities for Research Excellence Program (CURE)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMXP1323015482;""},{""name"":""Israel Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04sazxf24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Research Center grant 3131/20;""},{""name"":""Azrieli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/009svts64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Azrieli Postdoctoral Fellowship (cohort 2022-2023);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Cell therapy, using human pluripotent stem cell-derived ENS progenitors, offers an attractive alternative to treat this life-limiting disorder. Here we provide an in-depth characterisation of the HSCR phenotype in the B6;129-Ednrbtm1Ywa/J mouse model including molecular analyses highlighting the wide-ranging molecular effects of aganglionosis in HSCR colon. We show that transplantation of hPSC-derived ENS progenitors leads to significant increases in contractile function with formation of extensive donor-derived neuronal networks in colonic explants. Moreover, post-transplantation, we show that integration of ENS progenitors rescues many of the biological pathways impacted in the HSCR aganglionic microenvironment. These novel results provide strong evidence that human ENS progenitor transplantation can modulate critical signalling pathways affected in HSCR and exert positive impacts on contractile function, in aganglionic tissue, supporting further translational development of this regenerative medicine approach.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Trans-species miRNAs accumulate in host tissues a short distance from the site of parasite attachment. Trans-species miRNAs require C. campestris but not host Dicer-Like 1 (DCL1) for accumulation. These miRNAs specifically avoid Argonaute (AGO) loading in C. campestris tissue where they instead accumulate as miRNA/miRNA* duplexes. After arrival and short-distance spreading in host tissues, they are selectively loaded into host AGO1. This study clarifies the transcription, dicing, delivery, and function of C. campestris trans-species miRNAs.

MethodsWe applied an integrative screening framework to assess 29 candidate targets from risk-enriched biological domains. Using disease-relevant murine BV2 microglial cell lines with stable Psen2 knockdown, we performed siRNA-mediated perturbations followed by cellular phenotypic assays and quantitative proteomics.

ResultsTwenty-five candidate targets significantly altered at least one phenotype, with stronger effects in Psen2 knockdown cells. Integrated proteomic analyses identified several perturbations that reversed AD-associated molecular patterns. Five targets--Ap2a2, Pdhb, Pdha1, Dlat, and Psmc3-- impacted both phenotypes and related proteomic responses.

While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve.

When a protein is correlated with, but not causally linked to, disease, its genetic determinants can add unwanted variability to protein-disease associations. In such cases, removing the genetic component may improve their predictive performances.

Here, we tested this hypothesis by genetically adjusting 94 highly heritable proteins spanning diverse biological pathways and evaluating their associations with the onset of 37 diseases in 39,871 UK Biobank participants. Genetically adjusted proteins showed stronger associations in 88% of 1,312 significant protein-disease pairs, equivalent to a 30% median reduction in required sample size for comparable power. Of 96 protein-disease pairs with significant differences, all but one showed larger effects for adjusted proteins. Most proteins also showed consistently stronger associations with environmental and lifestyle factors once genetic effects were removed.

Finally, we constructed multi-protein scores from genetically adjusted proteins and demonstrated that they significantly improve prediction for 7 diseases compared to unadjusted proteins. These findings demonstrate that removing genetic effects from plasma proteins is an effective strategy to increase power for biomarker discovery and clinical trial design, consistent with the largely non-causal role of most plasma proteins in disease risk.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1760825324320

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

It has been instrumental in the adaptation of mammalian species to diverse environments, as reflected by its rapid molecular evolution7,8. However, the origins and evolutionary dynamics of liver cell types and their structural organization remain largely unexplored. Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data for liver cells from 17 species, spanning all major feeding strategies (herbivory, omnivory, carnivory, insectivory), great apes (including humans), placental clades (Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires), major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials, monotremes), and a bird as outgroup. Integrated with spatial transcriptomics, our data reveal that liver zonation--the compartmentalization of hepatocyte functions along the lobule, the livers fundamental anatomical and functional unit--is conserved across mammals but absent in other vertebrates. We find that zonation originated in the mammalian ancestor, driven by the emergence of WNT and R-spondin signaling from central vein endothelial cells, which activate central hepatocyte gene expression via the transcription factor TCF7L2. Despite this conserved architecture and signaling, genes with zonated expression exhibit rapid evolutionary turnover. Consistently, hepatocytes evolve fast, likely due to reduced selective constraints, enabling adaptive changes under positive selection. Alongside immune cells, hepatocytes are therefore key drivers of the livers rapid evolution and functional innovations. In great apes, we identify human-specific shifts in zonation and cell-type-specific expression linked to recent cis-regulatory changes, particularly in genes involved in lipid metabolism, likely contributing to human-specific metabolic traits. Our study uncovers the origins of a mammal-specific liver cell architecture, within which reduced constraints facilitated molecular changes underlying ecological adaptations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a ""rich"" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a ""simpler"" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow-wave activity, tying MBs topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MBs neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist. Our findings build on the quest to bridge mental content and its absence with measurable brain activity and provide insights into how ongoing thinking is maintained during wakefulness.","[{""name"":""Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie RISE programme NeuronsXnets"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101007926;""},{""name"":""European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST Action"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CA18106;""},{""name"":""Australian Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mmh0f86"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP240102680;""},{""name"":""National Health Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GNT1183280;GNT2037172;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23H04829;23H04830;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology (JST) Moonshot R&D Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJMS2295-14;""},{""name"":""Theoretical Sciences Visiting Program, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health grant NIH-NINDS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2R01NS089729;""},{""name"":""Ruth L.

These dynamics are central to predicting how species will respond to environmental change, particularly climate-driven shifts in plant phenology. The winter moth (Operophtera brumata) relies on synchronising larval egg hatch with leaf budburst of deciduous trees, yet whether they are locally adapted to their hosts phenology, and their capacity to track future change, remains unclear. Here, we investigated potential small-scale local adaptation of winter moths to oak tree phenology in Wytham Woods, UK, a 385-hectare woodland, within which oak budburst can vary by up to three weeks within a given year. We conducted laboratory temperature manipulation experiments using 76 clutches across six temperature treatments, and field translocation experiments using over 200 clutches. We combined these experiments with assessment of population structure from whole-genome sequencing of 59 individuals. This integrative approach allowed us to assess local adaptation in terms of phenotypic differences, fitness consequences, and genetic evidence. Temperature manipulations revealed systematic differences in the timing of egg hatching across temperature treatments at the clutch level which were linked to carry-over effects from the mothers emergence time, but unrelated to their source tree budburst timing. Field translocation experiments further showed no significant differences in survival of individuals transplanted to trees with phenology differing from their original host tree, and there was no genetic structure across the population. Together, these results reveal consistent differences in hatching phenology despite the absence of population structure, strong selection, or accordance with relative tree phenology. Our findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining close synchrony in trophic interactions at small scales, which may drive spatial variation in evolutionary responses to future climate change.","[{""name"":""UKRI Frontiers Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024520/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

The Prdm12 gene encodes a conserved zinc finger transcriptional regulator expressed selectively in the nervous system. In humans, PRDM12 mutations can cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES). Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12s role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored. Here, we conducted intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.S viral vectors encoding Prdm12-GFP (Prdm12-AAV) or GFP alone (Control-AAV), observing no overt changes in mouse behavior. When examining the properties of Prdm12 overexpressing sensory neurons in vitro, we observed an increase in rheobase alongside decreased neuronal responses to capsaicin and ATP, indicating a downregulation of TRPV1 and P2X ion channels activity, respectively. We next conducted intraarticular administration of viral constructs in female mice to determine how Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating sensory neurons alters their excitability and influences inflammatory joint pain induced by intraarticular administration of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA). Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating neurons decreased inflammation-induced changes in digging and weight bearing, prevented inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreased macroscopic voltage-gated ion channel conductance. Our findings illustrate that Prdm12 overexpression strongly modulates neuronal excitability in adult animals, highlighting its importance in pain perception and its potential as an analgesic target.

Here, we integrated ocean metagenomic data with state-of-the-art habitat modeling to study LDGs of marine prokaryotes across seasons and depths on a global scale. We found a strong depth and taxonomic dependency of the LDGs: while mixed layer marine microbial communities exhibited pronounced gradients with a peak in diversity at (sub)tropical latitudes (40{degrees} S-40{degrees} N) followed by a decline toward the poles, the communities at depth (200-1,000 m) showed no latitudinal structuring. The LDG in the surface mixed layer was largely underpinned by species of Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteriia, while other taxa exhibited distinct or even contrasting LDGs. Diversity structuring also varied by seasons and regions, governed by temperature, nutrients, and carbon dynamics. Together, these findings highlight that within the ocean microbiome, LDGs are not universal, but rather lineage-specific outcomes of differing ecological strategies and their responses to environmental gradients. By integrating taxonomic and spatiotemporal variability, our study provides fundamental insights into the structuring of ocean microbiome diversity and lays the foundation for predicting responses to environmental change.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""205320_215395;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0050/2023-L;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""862923;101059915;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324320

Using 60 years of life-history data from over 83,000 individuals, and historical daily climate records, we show that developmental stages in wild great tits (Parus major) differ in their sensitivity to extreme climatic events (ECEs). Exposure to extreme cold events during the first week of development is particularly detrimental to fledging mass, while extreme rain events have a stronger negative impact as chicks grow older and their energetic requirements increase. Synergistic effects of ECEs and average climatic conditions can be particularly severe, exacerbating the challenges faced by these birds. Our findings indicate that combined exposure to extreme heat and heavy rainfall during early development is associated with a predicted reduction in fledging mass by up to 27%. Additionally, birth timing may further modulate these effects, since late-season broods exposed to frequent hot ECEs during early development are predicted to fledge nestlings up to 4.27 standard deviations (35%) lighter than broods laid earlier in the season. Moreover, phenotypic plasticity has enabled many similar populations to shift towards an overall earlier laying date, which may have increased susceptibility to cold extremes during development. However, our analyses suggest that the benefits of being part of an early-laid clutch within a season may, to some extent, offset the negative effects of extreme climate on fledging mass and apparent survival. In climate scenarios where ECEs are predicted to increase in frequency, duration, and severity, these developmental stage-specific insights are crucial for understanding how climate change may be influencing wild avian populations.","[{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/K006274/1;NE/S010335/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/L006081/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Males of D. santomea, a West African island endemic, distinguish conspecific sexes but court males and females promiscuously and seldom attack. Elevated intermale courtship derives from at least three changes in two separate pheromone systems. In males, the sexually monomorphic cuticular pheromone 7-tricosene promotes rather than inhibits courtship and the courtship-inhibiting olfactory pheromone cVA is reduced 84-92% compared to close relatives, including the sibling species D. yakuba. The third change is surprisingly in D. santomea females, where cVA suppresses rather than promotes sexual receptivity. The female cVA switch and male cVA reduction may have co-evolved to maintain efficient intraspecific mating in D. santomea but prevent sympatric hybridization with D. yakuba, or to reduce intraspecific aggression. We find that high intermale courtship and low cVA also co-occur and appear selectively derived in a distant monomorphic species D. persimilis, implying pheromonal and behavioral convergence in the two recently speciated taxa. The data suggest that sequential changes in the behavioral valence and levels of pheromones explain the recent evolutionary emergence of intermale sexual behavior in Drosophila.","[{""name"":""NIH National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5R37DA031389;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Caltech Center for Evolutionary Science"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Della Martin Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

These mechanisms were long thought to rely exclusively on ATPase or GTPase proteins, until the discovery of CTPase activity in the bacterial chromosome segregation protein ParB. In the ParABS system, CTP binding enables ParB accumulation around the centromere-like parS DNA sites to activate the ATPase ParA, thereby facilitating chromosome partitioning to daughter cells. CTP hydrolysis then releases ParB from DNA for recycling. This discovery uncovered a new regulatory principle, but the broader diversity of proteins employing a CTPase mechanism remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale survey of proteins harboring the ParB-CTPase fold across bacteria, archaea, bacteriophages, and eukaryotes. While many ParB-like proteins follow the canonical ParABS organization with ParA partners, we also identify numerous orphan homologs encoded outside of the parAB operon, frequently linked to mobile genetic elements that may have driven their rapid diversification. The ParB-CTPase folds in these divergent proteins are often fused to lineage-specific domains with diverse predicted biological activities. We further demonstrate that while many homologs retain CTP-binding, others instead bind ATP or GTP, revealing a broader spectrum of nucleotide specificities than previously appreciated. Our findings establish the ParB-CTPase fold as a widely distributed and evolutionarily versatile NTP-binding module, repeatedly co-opted through domain fusion and shifts in nucleotide specificity to enable functions far beyond the classical ParABS-mediated DNA segregation.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""221776/Z/2/Z;227755/Z/23/Z;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NA;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

The pyrenoid, an algal biomolecular condensate that mediates one-third of global CO2 fixation, typically exists as one large condensate per chloroplast, but during cell division it transiently dissolves and reconfigures into multiple smaller condensates. Here, we identify a kinase, KEY1, in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that regulates pyrenoid condensate size and number dynamics throughout the cell cycle and is necessary for normal pyrenoid function and growth. Unlike wild type, key1 mutant cells have multiple smaller condensates throughout the cell cycle that fail to dissolve during cell division. We show that KEY1 localizes to the condensates and promotes their dissolution by disrupting interactions between their core constituents, the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco and its linker protein EPYC1, through EPYC1 phosphorylation.

The surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae), a group of 83 species across 6 genera, show high diversity in head, body, and propulsive fin (caudal and pectoral) shape, suggesting that morphometric analysis of these functionally relevant traits may provide insight into the ecomorphology and evolutionary history of this important fish family. Here, we develop a new multi-locus, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis for the surgeonfishes based on 19 loci for 80 acanthurid species and 45 outgroups. Detailed head, body, and fin geometric morphometric data were collected for all 80 surgeonfish species in the tree, and patterns of shape evolution across the family were visualized using phylomorphospaces. We used a three-state feeding trait axis across the herbivore to planktivore continuum to examine how morphometric shape relates to diet. Head and body shape were significantly associated with diet. Additionally, species exhibited two alternative locomotor strategies: high aspect ratio (AR) tails were associated with low AR pectoral fins, slender bodies, and pelagic planktivory, whereas species with low AR tail fins had wing-like, high AR pectoral fins, deeper bodies, and were mostly benthic grazers. Using a novel phylogenetic comparative method to investigate evolutionary correlations between shapes, we found that the caudal fin had the highest evolutionary rates and covaried with both the body and pectoral fin, likely due to dietary and locomotor demands, respectively.

Here we identify Hib, a previously unrecognized family of hibernation factors widespread in Archaea. Deletion of hib in Thermococcus barophilus delays recovery from stationary phase and reduces 70S ribosome pools, establishing its role in ribosome preservation. Hib displays a unique modular architecture, combining a bacterial-like HPF/RaiA domain with a Cystathionine Beta Synthase module. High-resolution cryo-EM structures of reconstituted and in cell-extracted Hib:ribosome complexes from Pyrococcus abyssi identify three conformations encompassing the positions of tRNAs at A, P and E sites during translation. Thus, Hib acts as a hibernation factor blocking all states of the dynamic translation process, preserving the ribosome from dissociation and degradation. Our findings define Hib as a key hibernation factor in Archaea and provide a framework for understanding ribosome dormancy and adaptation across all domains of life. Beyond the discovery of Hib, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis highlights the evolutionary relationships between prevalent ribosome hibernation factors across Bacteria and Archaea.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-25-CE12-4161;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Here, we investigated the neuroanatomical foundations of inter-individual variability in decision-making strategies. To this end, 122 healthy participants completed a gamified multi-armed bandit paradigm aimed at teasing apart distinct exploration-exploitation decision strategies. We also collected whole-brain quantitative MRI maps indexing microstructural features of cortical myelination and iron content. Through computational modelling, we disentangled individual-specific exploration strategies, including value-free random exploration. Whole-brain regression analyses identified significant associations between value-free exploration and increased cortical myelination in right frontal brain areas with reported links to impulsivity. By elucidating the brain microstructural correlates of distinct exploration-exploitation strategies, we aimed to further our understanding of why individuals differ in their decision-making capabilities, and how decision-making may become aberrant in mental health conditions.","[{""name"":""Lundbeck (Denmark)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0564cd633"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R272-2017-4345;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-2020-StG-948788;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""316955/Z/24/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Anthocyanins, a class of flavonoids responsible for vibrant shades of pink, red, and blue pigmentation, are almost ubiquitous in angiosperms but are replaced by betalains in some families in the order Caryophyllales.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, the second-largest fruit and vegetable family, characterised by white and yellow flowers and red, orange, and green fruits predominantly pigmented by carotenoids. Using a comprehensive collection of 258 datasets representing species across all 15 tribes of Cucurbitaceae and a phylogenomics approach, we observed a systematic absence of genes involved in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Absence of the structural genes DFR, ANS, arGST, LAR, and ANR, along with the anthocyanin-related regulatory MYB genes, was consistently confirmed by synteny and phylogenetic analysis.
C_LIO_LIThese results suggest that anthocyanin loss in angiosperms is more common than previously assumed. In light of this new discovery, we propose a stepwise loss of anthocyanin pigmentation in Cucurbitaceae, likely accompanied by a partial functional replacement with carotenoid pigmentation.

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Displaced myonuclei are typically attributed to the activity of muscle stem cells, or satellite cells. We sought to address whether displaced myonuclei in adult skeletal muscle are exclusively from an exogenous source such as satellite cells or can result from resident myonuclear migration. To address this question, we used a murine recombination-independent muscle fibre-specific doxycycline-inducible fluorescent myonuclear labelling approach, EdU stem cell fate tracking, two durations of muscle mechanical overload (MOV, 3 days and 7 days), and fluorescent histology. Our findings show that: 1) displaced myonuclei emerge early during MOV, 2) resident myonuclear movement occurs rapidly during MOV, and 3) the contribution of resident versus exogenous displaced myonuclei depends on MOV duration, fibre type, and fibre size. These observations provide fundamental insights on myonuclear motility in response to stress in vivo and reframe our understanding of how a recognized feature of mammalian skeletal muscle can emerge in response to mechanical loading.

Many cytoplasmic RNA viruses also harbor poly(A) tails on their genomic RNA and mRNAs. Here, we report that coronavirus infection causes cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) activity to become limiting, which preferentially destabilizes short-tailed host mRNAs, occurring before the action of virally encoded mRNA-decay factor nsp1. In this environment hostile to poly(A) tails, viral RNAs maintain a narrow tail-length distribution centering on 70-80 nucleotides across infection cycles. They do this through two mechanisms. First, viral tails are extended during RNA synthesis within double-membrane vesicles; second, viral tails are capped by a complex that includes PABPC1 and CSDE1 and slows tail shortening. Our findings suggest poly(A)-tail length is an arena of host- virus conflict, in which preserving tail lengths of viral mRNAs promotes their cytoplasmic dominance.

Tropical environments are undergoing intense rates of environmental change, and these changes may be driving large declines in genetic diversity. However, data on genetic diversity are highly skewed towards temperate regions. The degree to which diversity loss has occurred in tropical species, particularly marine species, remains an open and important question. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and museum collections of two commercially-harvested nearshore marine fishes (Equulites laterofenestra and Gazza minuta) gathered from a single location in the Philippines, spanning a century of intense environmental change. These data reveal a marked loss in genetic diversity and evidence for multiple orders of magnitude reductions in effective population size (Ne) in both species, indicating substantial genomic erosion. Such a decline highlights the long-lasting genomic consequences of anthropogenic activity and sheds light on an, until-now, invisible loss of diversity from the most biodiverse ocean region.

Significance StatementRecent reports have shown that genetic diversity in marine fishes has declined either slightly or not at all during the Anthropocene. However, almost all studies investigating marine genetic diversity loss have been from temperate latitudes, whereas tropical marine environments experience some of the most intense human impacts. Here, we directly compare genomic data from modern and historical specimens of two commercially-harvested fishes from the Philippines. We show that marine species in the tropics have already lost substantial genetic diversity and may have undergone severe bottlenecks over the past century. These results shine a light on the previously invisible loss of genetic diversity in the most biodiverse region of the ocean, and they emphasize the evolutionary consequences of the Anthropocene.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OISE-1743711;DEB-2343787;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

In sum, this platform provides a comprehensive 3D atlas of early neoplastic transformation, yielding mechanistic insights into tumor initiation and informing clinical screening strategies for detecting cancer precursors in whole organs at cellular resolution.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U54CA268083;RO1CA300052;UG3CA275681;P50CA228991;R01GM149976;U01AI167892;5R01NS111039;R21NS125395;U54 HL165443;U54 DK 134301;R01 HL170107;U2CCA271891;""},{""name"":""Sloan research fellow award, a CZI Scialog award, and UCSD Startup funds"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Johns Hopkins University and Instituto Superior Técnico student exchange program (HOPTEC and FLAD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""the Richard W.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer. Collectively, this research advances toward a more principled and generalizable brain decoding framework, laying the mathematical foundation for scalable brain-computer interfaces and other applications in computational neuroscience.","[{""name"":""Schroeder Institute for Brain Innovation and Recovery"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

This rare cyanobacterium-to-plastid transition has only been reported once more in Paulinella chromatophora [~]100 Mya. Unfortunately, the order and relative importance of organellogenesis events have been blurred by time in primary plastids and obscured by P. chromatophora becoming phototrophic. Here, we characterize the tripartite symbiosis in a benthic dinoflagellate (Sinophysis sp.) using diverse single-cell methods. Sinophysis houses a photosynthetic cyanobacterium closely interacting with an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. The cyanobacterium is in the intermediate stage of symbiont-to-organelle transition, with the host likely supporting it with metabolites and proteins, and controlling its cell division. Surprisingly, it seems to have replaced the hosts remnant non-photosynthetic plastid. Our results support mixotrophy, horizontal gene transfer, co-symbioses, and cell division control as early drivers of primary plastid origin and highlight the importance of protists for deciphering organellogenesis events.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K14256;23K05942;20K15856;""},{""name"":""Human Frontier Science Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGEC29/2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1760825324321
