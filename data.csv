MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

During the tumult of war they are, however, challenging to obtain due to the conflicts themselves. The Gaza Ministry of Health (GMoH) has provided regular updates to their post-October-7 violent death tally for the Gaza Strip. However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism and support. Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods. We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

A cohesive theory of the underlying mechanisms of the Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) remains unknown, primarily due to high variability in findings across independent studies. Here, we present a multimodal, cross-sectional MRI analysis of brain morphology (T1-MRI), tissue microstructure (diffusion-MRI), functional connectivity (functional-MRI), and cerebral blood flow (Arterial Spin Labeling MRI) in COVID-Recovered Patients (CRPs, N=76) and Healthy Controls (HCs, N=51). Although the global brain volumes did not differ between the two groups, CRPs showed focal atrophy in the right basal ganglia and limbic structures, along with cortical thinning in paralimbic regions (prefrontal cortex, insula) (p<0.05). Diffusion MRI analysis revealed reduced fractional anisotropy and elevated radial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum. No differences were observed in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cerebral blood flow between HCs and CRPs (p>0.05). We further investigated the effect of infection severity by stratifying the CRPs into hospitalized (HP; N = 21) and non-hospitalized (NHP; N = 46) groups. The microstructural damage was linked to infection severity, more pronounced in the HPs (p<0.05). In HPs, RSFC was diminished between components of the default mode network and the insula and caudate as compared to HCs and NHPs (p<0.05). Results suggest COVID-19 is associated with selective structural and functional alterations in basal ganglia-limbic-cortical circuits, with stronger effects in severe cases. Our findings are in line with common prevalent behavioral symptoms such as fatigue, memory impairment, attentional deficits, and insomnia. This study suggests that localized microstructural neuroinflammatory mechanisms contribute to post-COVID neurological symptoms and offers potential imaging biomarkers for targeted therapies and monitoring recovery.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides. Our results show that Siglec-6 relies only partially on its conserved Arg (Arg122) for recognition of membrane-bound gangliosides and that it supplements its binding free energy through interactions with the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding the target epitope. We identified residues Lys126 and Trp127 as key players in this unique membrane interaction, and we confirmed by mutagenesis assays that the loss of these residues abrogates binding. These results provide a step-change in our understanding of the diversification of human Siglecs across group 2, where different members likely evolved as molecular precision tools, to bind specific sialosides by adapting their structure to recognize not only the epitope, but also the biological environment in which it is found.","NA","biorxiv",1750802971780

The limit of detection for recombinant antigens was 0.67 pg/ml, and inactivated whole virus wild-type and Omicron variants were 13 TCID50/mL and 8.8 TCID50/mL, respectively. Our blinded clinical study with 103 patient upper respiratory tract swab samples showed 95.1% sensitivity (Ct [&le;] 30) and 100% specificity benchmarked to RT-qPCR, with no cross-reactivity to influenza A, RSV, and Rhinovirus. Analysis of trial data indicates spin-enhanced LFTs could diagnose SARS-CoV-2 on average 2.0 days earlier than conventional gold nanoparticle LFTs with identical antibodies, and just 0.6 days after RT-qPCR. Quantum-enhanced LFT sensitivity would have detected [~]69,400 more patients in a single day at the peak of Omicron, reducing the transmission risk and protecting populations. Our findings mark an important milestone in the emerging field of quantum-enhanced diagnostics, with the potential for significant health-economic benefits to patients, populations, health systems and society.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

While vesicle trafficking is likely involved, we hypothesized a complementary mechanism involving direct membrane interactions. Using domain homology and proteomic profiling of chloroplast membrane fractions, we identified candidate lipid transport proteins enriched in a distinct, intermediate-density membrane population. This fraction was enriched in lipid metabolic enzymes and proteins homologous to known membrane organization factors. Several candidates, including TVP38 FAMILY PROTEIN (TVPFP), PLASMA MEMBRANE FUSION PROTEIN (PMFP), and LETM1-LIKE, localized to discrete subdomains within chloroplasts. Loss- of-function tvpfp or pmfp mutants exhibited altered chloroplast ultrastructure, including changes in thylakoid-envelope proximity, supporting their roles in maintaining membrane architecture. These findings identify a specialized chloroplast membrane region enriched in lipid-related functions and offer a foundation for elucidating the molecular architecture of these regions.","NA","biorxiv",1750802971780

We quantify the occupancy of LSD at cerebral serotonin 2A receptors and show that LSD increases global cerebral blood flow and internal carotid artery flow without affecting the diameter of the internal carotid artery, opposite effects to those observed following psilocybin. Functional connectivity analyses showed widespread decreases in global connectivity, particularly in visual networks, alongside increases in network-wise sample entropy and spatial complexity. We observed an anticlockwise hysteresis loop between plasma drug levels and subjective effects, suggesting atypical pharmacodynamic mechanisms. By establishing the dose-occupancy relation of LSD in humans, our findings provide critical insights for the clinical development of psychedelic compounds and demonstrate unique neurophysiological effects that distinguish LSD from related psychedelics.

However, the insertion of these systems into enzymes is often performed with little consideration of the structural impact they might have. This is particularly relevant when modifying complex molecular machines that transition between numerous conformational states. Here, we address this issue by developing SIMPLIFE, a computational workflow that supports the design of optimal insertion sites for conjugation tags based on the structure of the proteins involved and performs localised residue redesign where needed. We demonstrate how SIMPLIFE can be used to effectively augment the function of T7 RNA polymerase using the DogCatcher-DogTag system, enabling diverse and dynamically varying mutations within a targeted region of DNA.

However, this sex/gender gap has been narrowing in recent decades, likely due to an increase in cannabis use among women and girls, who have been historically under-represented in cannabis research. The lack of sex- and gender-based approaches within cannabis research has been highlighted in previous reviews, some of which have synthesized existing literature of associations between sex, gender, and cannabis use. What is missing is a clinically-relevant synthesis of evidence for sex and gender influences on problematic cannabis use, including treatment-related outcomes that could be used to influence care. The objective of this scoping review is to identify and synthesize published evidence about the influence of sex and gender on correlates and outcomes of treatment among people with problematic cannabis use (including CUD). Furthermore, we will examine to what extent this published literature has considered how sex and gender intersect with other social categories such as race and sexuality.

Methods and AnalysisThis scoping review will follow the most commonly used methodology, the 2005 Arksey and OMalley scoping study framework (including the optional consultation exercise to solicit feedback from relevant stakeholders) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines. We will search MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 2010 and the present. Included studies must be conducted in human participants with problematic cannabis use (e.g., diagnosis or screening for CUD) and include an analysis of sex- and/or gender-related factors. Using Covidence software, two independent reviewers will screen each record at the title/abstract and full text phases. Two independent reviewers will then use a data charting form developed by the study team to extract data. Data charting and both phases of article screening will begin with a pilot process completed by the entire team to ensure consistency. Article data will be exported into a spreadsheet to facilitate summary and basic descriptive statistics. Studies will be grouped together first by content area (e.g., treatment correlates, treatment effectiveness), then by study design, and which sex- or gender-related factors are considered in the analysis.

DisseminationWe will disseminate findings using two main strategies. First, we will engage in traditional knowledge translation, including publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentation at both medical and scientific conferences.

However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Most AI palliative care research involves the use of routinely collected data from electronic healthcare records patient data; however, there is little data about the of the views of palliative care healthcare professionals on the role of AI in practice. Determining the opinions of palliative care healthcare professionals on potential uses of AI in palliative care will be useful for policymakers and practitioners to determine, and inform, meaningful use of AI in palliative care practice. Aim To explore palliative care healthcare professionals views on the use of AI for analysis of patient data in palliative care. Methods Phenomenological study using qualitative semi-structured interviews of palliative care healthcare professionals with a minimum of one-year clinical experience in a hospice in the Northwest of England. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results We interviewed six palliative care professionals comprising of doctors, nurses and occupational therapies. AI was viewed positively, although most participants had not used this in practice. No participants had received training in AI and said that education in AI would be beneficial. Participants described potential benefits of palliative care AI, which included identification of people requiring palliative care interventions, and to evaluate patient experience. Participants highlighted security and ethical concerns of AI, related to data governance, efficacy, patient confidentiality and consent issues. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of staff perceptions of AI in palliative care. Our findings support the role of AI in enhancing care, addressing education needs, and tackling trust, ethics, and governance issues. This study lays the groundwork for guidelines on AI implementation, urging further research on methodological, ethical, and practical aspects of AI in palliative care.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

MethodsThree weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, non-hospitalized adult participants enrolled in the COVID HOME study consented to complete a questionnaire by phone on the presence, characteristics, and impact on daily life and QoL of olfactory, gustatory and/or trigeminal changes. Participants reporting taste and/or smell changes completed the same questionnaire at three months and, when still present, at six months.

ResultsThe questionnaire was completed by 94/117 participants included in this study three weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. The 43 participants with smell and/or taste changes completed the questionnaire at three months, and 19 at six months. Of the 94 participants, 56% were female and the median age was 43 [IQR 29-55] years. At three weeks post-infection, olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal changes were reported by 40 (43%), 37 (39%), and 8 (9%) participants, respectively. During follow-up, olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal changes were reported by 17 (40%), 14 (33%), and 3 (7%) at three months, and 12 (63%), 9 (47%), and 1 (5%) participants at six months, respectively. Most patients reported an impact of sensory changes on daily life and QoL, mostly describing it as a bit or  quite a bit. However, impact did not differ between time points and most participants reported taking no action to cope with these changes. Participants with reported sensory alterations were most interested in professional help at six months.

ConclusionsIn non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the reported prevalence of olfactory, gustatory and trigeminal changes is higher three weeks after infection. Most patients report modest impact on daily life and QoL due to these sensory changes, and a subgroup reported a profound effect.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

However, in humans, corresponding changes in dopamine-dependent behavior, such as reward learning with increasing BMI, have not been conclusively established and dissociated from pathological eating behavior. Here, we provide a principled assessment of differences in reinforcement learning (RL) related to obesity or pathological eating, such as binge eating (BE), using a large sample of 370 participants enriched for high BMI and BE. To dissociate trait and state components of RL, participants completed up to 31 runs of a novel RL game across weeks (1,486,950 observed choices). We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the mean and variability of parameters for each individual. Across runs, higher BMI was predicted by higher and more variable learning rates using elastic net models ({Delta}R2=.19; pperm<.0001) although performance did not differ (r=-0.04, pboot=.46). In contrast, BE and the dimension loss of control were characterized by lower and more variable reward sensitivity ({Delta}R2=.19, controlled for BMI; pperm<.0001) leading to fewer points (r=.10, pboot=.030). Crucially, patients with BE disorder also showed attenuated reward sensitivity in the nucleus accumbens during anticipation in an effort task that required no learning (p=.006). We conclude that obesity-related differences in reward learning are best explained by changes in learning, whereas BE and loss of control were mostly driven by reduced reward sensitivity. Notably, repeated assessments revealed that increased variability across states contribute to both obesity and BE. Our findings highlight the necessity to complement neurobiological research with behavioral precision mapping to derive mechanistic insight into multidimensional disorders such as obesity and BE disorder.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Yet, the molecular mechanisms through which juvenile environments shape adult physiology and behavior via transstadial effects remain largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that larval competition, a key ecological stressor, profoundly alters adult body size, survival, reproductive output, host-seeking behavior, olfactory neurophysiology, and vector competence in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Crucially, using transcriptomic profiling and integrative network analyses, we identify seven regulatory hub genes whose expression is strongly associated with size-dependent variation in olfactory behavior, reproductive investment, and Zika virus transmission potential. These hub genes belong to gene modules enriched for functions in chemosensory processing, metabolic regulation, and signal transduction, revealing a molecular framework mediating environmentally induced plasticity across metamorphosis. Integrating these empirical findings into a transmission model, we show that incomplete larval control can inadvertently increase outbreak risk by producing larger, longer-lived, and more competent vectors. Our results uncover molecular mechanisms underpinning phenotypic plasticity in disease vectors and highlight the critical need to account for transstadial effects in models of vector-borne disease transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1750802971780

However, it is currently unknown what molecular changes are induced by the surgery, how they relate to the health improvements, how early they occur, and whether they are maintained over time.

In this study, we characterized early gene expression changes following surgery in blood samples from the ""Personalised Medicine for Morbid Obesity"" cohort. We observed widespread changes in gene expression only a few days after surgery. Pathways related to immune response were affected, in particular with a decreased expression of the NF-{kappa}B pathway and neutrophil cytotoxic activity genes, suggesting a reduction of the inflammatory state typically associated with obesity. Metabolic signaling was also affected, with decreased expression of genes from pathways related to glucagon and insulin secretion, and key regulators such as the appetite-controlling hormone ghrelin. Comparisons to publicly available transcriptomics datasets showed that beyond these specific changes, bariatric surgery induces a transcriptome-wide reversal of expression changes associated with obesity and with forms of type 2 diabetes related to obesity. Comparisons to transcriptomics studies with longer-term follow-ups after bariatric surgery showed that a large fraction of early-induced expression changes likely persist for several months.

Taken together, we show that previously unreported early changes in blood gene expression after bariatric surgery provide in-depth insights into the resolution of the chronic inflammation associated with severe obesity and its connection with metabolic improvement.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Age of natural menopause (ANM) and reproductive lifespan is determined by the formation and subsequent depletion of follicles in females. In this study, we identified a robust association between a common functional missense variant in PARP1 and age at menopause in a sample of 201,323 women. Using an in vitro model to generate primordial germ cells - the precursors of sperm and oocytes- we report that Parp1 affects PGCs in two different ways. Our identified missense variant (V762A) significantly reduces the germ cell population by enhanced DNA binding resulting in increased apoptosis. Conversely, deletion of Parp1 results in an increased population of PGCs and proteomic analysis revealed that transcription factors that drive PGC formation show increased expression in precursor cells. This is caused by increased transcription of Rhox genes (Rhox2A, Rhox6 and Rhox9), implicating Parp1 in downregulation of genes that determine PGC fate. We propose that Parp1 regulates PGC fate and that its increased chromatin association ( trapping) causes a decreased population of PGCs, thereby providing a molecular cause of the earlier onset menopause on female carriers of the variant.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

This study investigated IgG to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in Malawian pregnant women participating in the REVAMP trial, where no COVID-19 clinical cases or positive SARS-CoV-2 tests were reported during the pandemic (April 2020 to September 2021). Methods: We analysed serum samples collected from November 2018 to September 2021 from 852 pregnant women at enrolment (second trimester) and delivery, measuring IgG against five SARS-CoV-2 antigens using a multiplex bead assay. IgG to Tetanus toxoid served as a positive control, and IgG to four seasonal coronavirus antigens and Influenza A were used for context. Findings: Women recruited after the start of the pandemic were younger than those recruited before the emergence of COVID-19 (median age 19 vs 21 years) and more likely primigravid (60.1% vs 51.1%). IgG levels to SARS-CoV-2 antigens showed sharp increases of 18.5% - 29.7% every 30 days during COVID waves 2 and 3. Overall seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens reached 39.3% during the pandemic; however, the 14.7% seropositivity detected pre-pandemic demonstrates the presence of cross-reactive antibody responses against other antigens in Malawi. Surprisingly, pregnancies within the pandemic showed improved outcomes, with longer gestations (mean difference: 0.6 weeks [95% CI: 0.2 - 0.9]) and higher birth weights (mean difference: 169.3g, [65.9 - 272.6]) when compared to pregnancies occurring pre-pandemic. We found no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were associated with pregnancy outcomes. Interpretations: This study demonstrates that serological surveillance reveals undetected SARS-CoV-2 exposure where traditional testing was limited.

These findings highlight pregnancy cohorts as valuable sentinel populations for infectious disease surveillance, emphasising the importance of serosurveillance in resource-limited settings.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Plasmepsin-2 and mdr1 copy number variations were typed by digital PCR. Among 157 isolates, no validated pfkelch13 mutations linked to artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) were detected. However, a novel pfkelch13 mutation, A675T, was identified. A mutation in the same position (A675V) had been found and validated in neighboring Rwanda previously. Background mutations were frequent, including pffd D193Y (45.9%) and pfarps10 V127M (11.5%). Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance was widespread, with quintuple haplotypes detected in 82.3% and sextuple haplotypes in 12.3% of mono-infections. The pfcrt IET triple mutant haplotype (94.9%) and pfmdr1 N-F-D mutant haplotype (57.9%) indicate sustained CQ resistance and efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL). No pfpm2 duplications but rare pfmdr1 amplifications (1.8%) were identified. These findings indicate substantial SP resistance, posing a threat to the efficacy of IPTp and SMC strategies in Burundi. The findings also show potential ART-R and partner drug resistance in Burundi, highlighting the need for strengthened surveillance and coordinated regional efforts to mitigate resistance and sustain malaria control.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Treatment was safe, well-tolerated, and associated with rapid clinical improvement, including enhanced lung function, reduced obstruction, and a 100-fold decrease in bacterial burden. Multi-omic profiling revealed in situ phage replication, transient suppression of non- mucoid P. aeruginosa, and virome restructuring. Bacterial isolates evolved resistance with associated fitness costs, while the host developed phage-specific neutralizing antibodies that limited systemic activity. Despite this, one phage persisted in the lung beyond therapy. These findings offer in vivo insight into phage-host- microbiome dynamics during treatment and underscore the importance of integrating microbial ecology and immune profiling into phage therapy design. This case highlights the potential for phage therapy in late-stage CF and the value of personalized, immune-informed strategies for managing chronic infection.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

The aim of this research was to identify small molecule inhibitors of NET production using a highly-curated panel of narrow-spectrum small molecule kinase inhibitors termed the Kinase Chemogenomic Set (KCGS). Methods: Neutrophils were isolated from healthy controls (HC) and people with RA or SLE. Over 220 small molecules were screened for their ability to inhibit NET production and decrease ROS production without impairing neutrophil apoptosis or killing of S. aureus bacteria. Results: Fifty compounds, nominally targeting 29 individual protein kinase targets, were found to inhibit NOX2-dependent (PMA-stimulated) and NOX2-independent (A23187-stimulated) NET production (p<0.05, n=5 HC, RA and SLE). Of these, seven compounds did not significantly impair ROS production or apoptosis. The deconvoluted targets of these small molecules inhibit kinases that operate in three cellular pathways: autophagy, cell cycle checkpoint and epidermal growth factor (EGF) tyrosine kinase signalling. Of these, only inhibitors of ULK1, JNK and ROCK1/2, broadly implicated in the regulation of autophagy, did not significantly impair bacterial killing (n=5 HC, p>0.05). Autophagy inhibitors were also able to inhibit immune-complex driven NET production (p<0.05, n=5 HC, RA and SLE). Conclusion: We propose that autophagy signalling pathways represent novel and exciting targets for the development of small molecule therapeutics to block unwanted neutrophil activation and NET release in immune-mediated inflammatory disease.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

While a genetic association between mental disorders and autoimmune diseases has been suggested, their genetic relationship remains incompletely understood. Utilizing a complementary set of statistical analyses, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the genetic architecture between severe mental disorders (major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ)) and seven autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes), involving a total of 667,518 cases from 10 genome-wide association studies. While MD was positively genetically correlated with five autoimmune diseases, BD and SCZ were only positively correlated with IBD, suggesting differences in the genetic signal shared with autoimmunity across these mental disorders. A considerable fraction of genetic variants influencing autoimmune diseases (range 17.1-88.4 %) were estimated to overlap with mental disorders; however, this constitutes only a minor part of genetic variants influencing the more polygenic mental disorders. Finally, we identified 172 genetic loci jointly affecting mental disorders and autoimmune diseases, implicating both lipid metabolism and TNF signaling. In conclusion, MD, BD, and SCZ have a small but distinct genetic overlap with autoimmune diseases, which may inform new possible immune targets for treatment in mental illness.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Because different types of epilepsy involve different brain networks, numerous DBS targets have been explored. Methods: To provide a comprehensive overview of this expanding literature, we conducted a systematic review of studies for DBS in epilepsy, collecting data on surgical targets, individual disease characteristics, outcomes, and precise electrode placements. DBS electrode coordinates were gathered into a common template space and related to clinical outcomes. Findings: We included 124 studies, corresponding to 1,210 patients and 20 distinct surgical targets. While the anterior (ANT) and centromedian (CM) nuclei of the thalamus remain the most studied, we also review less commonly used targets that show promise for specific forms of epilepsy and may warrant further investigation. Substantial variability in targeting strategies and electrode placement was observed within each of the target regions. Importantly, significant relationships between stimulation location and outcomes were identified for ANT- and CM-DBS. For ANT-DBS, shorter distance to the mammillothalamic tract junction was associated with greater seizure reduction on both study- and patient-level analyses (r=-0.55, p<0.001 and r=-0.51, p<0.001, respectively). For CM-DBS, localization effects may be dependent on the form of epilepsy, with stimulation of the parvocellular CM being associated with better outcomes in generalized epilepsy. Interpretation: Our results emphasize the importance of accurate targeting in DBS for epilepsy. Our database and atlas of DBS targets are made publicly available, potentially serving further meta-analytical work.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Limited treatment options and the complex nature of disease progression make therapeutic decision-making difficult. This study systematically reviewed the existing literature on management strategies and emerging therapeutic approaches for refractory NTM-PD. Methods: We systematically reviewed studies on NTM-PD treatment failure published from inception until 31 January 2024, examining associated factors, intensification strategies, and supportive measures. Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, predominantly exhibiting retrospective observational methodology and focusing on pulmonary disease by Mycobacterium avium complex and Mycobacterium abscessus species. Findings were synthesised qualitatively due to the considerable heterogeneity in study design and outcomes. Results: Before treatment intensification or de-escalation, the impact of antibiotic treatment on health-related quality of life and microbiological factors, such as acquired resistance and changes in the pathogenic NTM, should be assessed. The presence of severe radiological findings at the beginning of treatment and a history of multiple antibiotic regimen modifications were associated with a lower chance of treatment success. Evidence regarding supportive interventions for treatment-refractory NTM-PD, such as nutritional counselling, respiratory rehabilitation, and psychosocial support, remains limited. Intermittent administration of intravenous antibiotics may be an additional strategy for symptom management. Depending on the causative NTM species, some antibiotic options have been explored for treatment intensification, although most of these are based on observational studies. Surgical resection remains an option for localised disease, although the risk of recurrence remains substantial in the case of preoperative positive culture. Novel therapeutic approaches remain under investigation as potential alternatives. Discussion: This systematic review underscores the complexity of managing refractory NTM-PD, highlighting the role of treatment intensification, symptom control, supportive measures and knowledge gaps. While no standardised approach exists, individualised strategies incorporating clinical, microbiological, and radiological factors remain essential for optimising patient outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Fixation stability, the ability to maintain steady visual fixation, may serve as a transdiagnostic marker in major psychiatric disorders. This study evaluates fixation stability as a potential transdiagnostic endophenotype in families with multiple affected individuals. Methods: Monocular eye tracking data was recorded using infrared cameras while participants fixed their gaze on a stimulus in trials with and without distractors. The fixation stability (FS) performance was compared across 449 individuals affected with major psychiatric disorders (26 Alzheimers Dementia (AD), 89 schizophrenia (SCZ), 116 bipolar disorder (BD), 98 obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and 120 substance-use disorder (SUD)), 442 unaffected first degree relatives (FDRs) along with 145 healthy controls (HC). FS performance was compared across groups using a linear mixed effects model controlling for familiality, age and sex. Result: Affected individuals performed significantly poorly (fixation frequency(F=6.37, pcor=0.003), median fixation duration(F=4.79, pcor=0.009), saccade frequency(F=7.74, pcor<0.001), mean saccade amplitude(F=4.92, pcor=0.009), mean scanpath length(F=6.83, pcor=0.003)) in the trials with distractors when compared to FDRs and HC.

Yet it remains unclear how genetic and biomarker indicators of Alzheimer's risk, such as the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele and amyloid burden, relate to sex differences in brain and cognitive health during the preclinical stage. Using established normative models trained on ~58,000 healthy participants, we computed regional z-scores from T1-weighted MRI scans in 372 cognitively normal participants from the Insight 46 cohort. Scans were acquired at two timepoints, approximately three years apart, beginning at age 70. Regions with z-scores below -1.96 were classified as brain-structure outliers and summarized as total outlier count (tOC). We used linear mixed-effects models to examine how sex, age, and AD risk (APOE4 status and amyloid burden) relate to tOC and cognitive outcomes measured by Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC) scores. Both cross-sectional associations and longitudinal changes in tOC and PACC scores were examined, and we tested whether the effects of APOE4 status and amyloid burden on brain and cognitive measures differed by sex. Cross-sectional analyses showed that males had greater tOC than females at younger ages. At timepoint 1, spatial maps showed more regions with outliers in males, though high outlier proportions were limited to occipital areas. By timepoint 2, group differences became more spatially distinct, with males and females showing deviations in different regions. Longitudinally, older males exhibited steeper increases in tOC over time compared to females. Females showed higher PACC scores overall, while no sex differences were observed in cognitive change over time. Greater tOC and amyloid burden were both associated with poorer cognitive outcomes, with the strongest association observed in female APOE4 carriers. However, we found no evidence that AD risk influenced age-related changes in tOC or cognition over time. These findings highlight the complex interplay between sex, age, and AD risk in shaping brain structure and cognition in later life. Some of the observed patterns may reflect emerging vulnerability not yet captured by short-term longitudinal change, underscoring the importance of continued observation. In conclusion, normative modelling provides a valuable approach for detecting subtle variation in brain and cognitive aging across risk groups.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

Weak electric currents are injected using scalp electrodes while measuring the MR phase perturbations caused by the tiny magnetic fields (1-2 nT) induced by the current flow in tissue. MRCDI generally has a low signal-to-noise ratio, making it susceptible to technical imperfections and physiological noise. Here, we tested and optimized simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) EPI for time-efficient and robust brain MRCDI. Methods: MRCDI data was acquired in a phantom and five human brains using SMS-EPI optimized for measuring current-induced phase perturbations. Multiband factors and interslice gaps were systematically varied and the resulting image quality assessed. In particular, the impact of interslice signal leakage on the measured phase was tested. Results: Current-free acquisitions showed the expected noise amplification with decreasing interslice distances. However, physiological noise generally dominated the human data, making the overall noise levels identical to single-slice EPI for interslice gaps of at least 12 mm and multiband factors between 3 and 5. Upon application of electric currents, the phantom data revealed subtle artifacts for multiband factors 5 and 6, even for large gaps. Nevertheless, artifacts were absent in the human brain for multiband factors up to 5, where the performance of SMS-EPI approached that of single-slice measurements for sufficient interslice distances. Conclusion: Optimized SMS-EPI with multiband factors up to 5 and minimum interslice gaps of 12 mm performs on par with single-slice EPI, making it attractive for increasing brain coverage in MRCDI.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

However, as civilisations over recent millennia have developed, the human brain has become steadily disconnected from these natural stimuli. Consequently, detrimental effects on individual health are increasingly recognised. Strategies that promote reconnection with Nature have yielded significant gains when it comes to psychological and general physical health, although much less is known about their direct impact on neurological health. In this systematic review, we identified 17 studies that assessed at least one Nature-based intervention to treat any neurological disease. The predominant study design was quasi-experimental (n=9). Interventions included horticultural therapy, petal arranging and farm visits. The majority of studies had a moderate risk of bias. While 88% (n=15) of studies reported improvements in measures such as quality of life, mood, agitation, apathy or cognitive function, there was such an overrepresentation of studies recruiting patients with dementia (94%; n=16) that for many common neurological disorders, including epilepsy, migraine and multiple sclerosis, the current literature leaves us none the wiser. Considering the extensive crosstalk that exists between physical and psychological disease, we argue that the potential benefit of formal Nature Prescriptions as an accessible, cheap and harmless endorsement of healing warrants greater attention in neurology. Indeed, this aligns with the wider societal and environmental need for humans to reconnect with the natural world.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we commercially obtained synthetic DNA fragments containing locus-specific homology regions, antibiotic marker cassettes, and standardized Cas9 target sequences. By using these locus-specific synthetic DNA fragments, we relocated 7 functional chromosomal loci. Scarless relocation mutants of the trg, aer, tsr, malHM, malQT, macB-nadA, and folA chromosomal loci were obtained as antibiotic-resistant isolates by combining Cas9 counterselection with the restoration of an antibiotic marker cassette. The additional antibiotic marker cassettes and standardized Cas9 target sequences present in the synthetic DNA fragments are inherently eliminated upon completion of the procedure, enabling iterative processing of loci. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome (re-)engineering of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done on wild-type cells.","NA","biorxiv",1750802971780

This transcript significantly related to PD in the eQTL analyses and in two of the three predictive models.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

The largest previous genetic studies of measures of intelligence have used [~]270k individuals who completed the fluid intelligence (FI) test in UK Biobank. Here, we integrate additional FI measures in this cohort and leverage eighty-two correlated variables to impute FI values for unmeasured individuals, increasing the sample size to >450k. Through population-based and within-family genome-wide association studies and downstream analyses, we show that this imputation produces a phenotype that genetically resembles measured FI and reduces ascertainment bias within the cohort. We further show that combining measured and imputed FI scores increases the number of independent SNP associations (p<5x10-8) from 385 to 608 and increases polygenic score accuracy in external cohorts by 15% on average. Additionally, incorporating imputed FI scores increases the number of gene-level associations with rare variants from five to twenty-six (FDR<1%). These include fourteen well-established developmental disorder-associated genes, a four-fold enrichment (p=8x10-8); for several of these, our results suggest that loss-of-function variants in the gene impact neurodevelopment, in addition to the previously documented altered-function variants. We also implicate twelve genes without strong prior evidence of association developmental disorders, of which eight have not been previously linked to intelligence (ROBO2, RB1CC1, ANK3, CHD9, TLK1, PCLO, DPP8, IPO9). These twelve genes were significantly enriched for de novo loss-of-function mutations in a set of >31k patients with developmental disorders (p=6.8x10-4). We further identify three genes showing significant rare variant associations with educational attainment but not with FI, including CADPS2 in which, unusually, protein-truncating variants show a positive association. Our results demonstrate the power of phenotype imputation for genetic studies and suggest that incorporating genetic association results for cognitive phenotypes in the general population could help discover new developmental disorder genes.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

YOLT-101, an in vivo base-editing therapeutic agent delivered via GalNAc-modified lipid nanoparticles, is designed to achieve permanent inactivation of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), enabling sustained LDL-C reduction.

MethodsThis trial enrolled participants with heterozygous genetic mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and LDL-C levels of [&ge;]2.6 mmol/L (without ASCVD) or [&ge;]1.8 mmol/L (with ASCVD) despite receiving moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy. Eligible patients received a single intravenous infusion of YOLT-101 at ascending doses (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mg/kg). We report interim results from an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of YOLT-101.

ResultsSix participants were enrolled (median age, 48 years, range, 34-62) in the study. The most common adverse events (AEs) were transient infusion-related reactions (83.3%) and elevations in alanine/aspartate aminotransferase (50%). No study withdrawals or AEs of grade 3 or higher occurred. PCSK9 and LDL-C levels decreased in a dose-dependent manner following YOLT-101 administration. In the 0.6mg/kg group (n=3), mean PCSK9 levels decreased by 55.9% at week 1 and by 75.8% and 72.5% after 1 and 4 months, respectively; corresponding LDL-C reductions were 33.2%, 48.9%, and 50.4%, respectively.

ConclusionsA single infusion of YOLT-101 at 0.6 mg/kg was well tolerated and led to sustained PCSK9 and LDL-C reduction, demonstrating promise for future clinical development. (Funded by YolTech Therapeutics; Registration Number: NCT06458010)","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750802971780
