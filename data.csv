While previous studies have focused on characterizing PASC and identifying its subphenotypes in children and adolescents following an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, the risks of PASC with Omicron-variant reinfections remain unclear. Using a real-world data approach, this study investigates the risks of PASC following reinfections during the Omicron phase in the pediatric population.

OBJECTIVETo investigate the risks of PASC diagnosis and 24 PASC symptoms and conditions after reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 during Omicron period in the pediatric population.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 40 childrens hospitals and health institutions in U.S. between January 2022 and October 2023.

EXPOSURESA second SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) or antigen tests, or a diagnose of COVID-19, occurring at least 60 days after the initial infection, compared to the initial infection.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESPASC was identified using two approaches: (1) the ICD-10- CM diagnosis code U09.9 and (2) a symptom-based definition including 24 physician-identified symptoms and conditions. Absolute risks of incident PASC were reported, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated by comparing the second infection episode with the first infection episode groups using a modified Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through exact matching and propensity scoring matching.

RESULTSA total of 465,717 individuals under 21 years old (mean [SD] age 8.17 [6.58] years; 52% male) were included. Compared to the first infection, a second infection was associated with significantly increased risk of an overall PASC diagnosis (RR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.59), and with many specific conditions including: myocarditis (RR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.46-8.86); changes in taste and smell (RR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.41-5.67); thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.71-3.04); heart disease (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.69 to 2.28); acute kidney injury (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.38 to 2.61); fluid and electrolyte (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.62 to 2.20); generalized pain (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.48 to 1.95); arrhythmias (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.45-1.74); abnormal liver enzyme (RR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.96); fatigue and malaise (RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.64); musculoskeletal pain (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.37 to 1.54); abdominal pain (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.34 to 1.50); postural orthostatic tachycardia syndromes (POTS)/dysautonomia (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.51); cognitive functions (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.50); and respiratory signs and symptoms (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33). The risks were consistent across various organ systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEChildren and adolescents face significantly higher risk of various PASC outcomes after reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings suggest a cumulative risk of PASC and highlight the urgent need for targeted prevention strategies to reduce reinfections, which includes an increased emphasis on initial or re-vaccination of children.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDo children and adolescents face an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) following reinfection during the Omicron era?

FindingsDuring the post-acute phase, children and adolescents with reinfection are at statistically significant increased risk of incident PASC outcomes, including an overall PASC diagnosis and 24 most commonly complaints/symptoms/diagnoses associated with PASC. The risks remained consistent across different demographic and clinical subgroups.

MeaningThese findings underscore the significant long-term health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in children and adolescents. Public health strategies should prioritize reinfection prevention, including enhanced vaccination efforts, to mitigate the burden of PASC in the pediatric population.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151814

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

Yet, designing, manufacturing, and delivering LBPs remains challenging, in part due to a lack of technologies capable of analyzing LBPs as complete, spatially organized consortia. Conventional sequencing-based methods lack sensitivity and specificity and do not provide critical spatial information. To address this, we present high-phylogenetic-resolution spatial mapping platform (HiPR-Map), a state-of-the-art spectral imaging technology that enables precise enumeration and spatial localization of microbial cells at species-level within complex communities. Through these advantages, HiPR-Map provides unique insights for LBP discovery and development. Applying HiPR-Map to an LBP designed to complement immune checkpoint therapy, we profiled over 1.8 million microbial cells engrafted in the murine gut. Our analysis revealed distinctive microbial spatial organization, underscoring the power of imaging-based microbiome profiling to optimize LBP design and characterization. This work highlights the transformative potential of spatial microbiome analysis for next-generation LBP development.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151814

Although most COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild, severe infections requiring hospitalization have resulted in likely more than 14 million cumulative deaths to date. One hallmark of severe COVID-19 is a dysregulated immune response that leads to systemic inflammation and contributes to disease severity and mortality but is not explained by viral replication alone. Severe COVID-19 has been shown to disrupt the gut microbiome and increase intestinal permeability which may contribute to immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation. In this study, we investigated the differences in plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation and gut barrier damage as well as circulating cytokines between healthy volunteers and patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We then performed a correlation analysis to understand how the relationships between these plasma biomarkers differed and used a random forest model to assess their accuracy in distinguishing between these two groups. Our results demonstrated that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have elevated concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of microbial translocation, and that the relationships between these biomarkers were significantly altered compared to healthy volunteers, especially those related to the mucosal associated homeostatic cytokines IL-17A and IL-23. Furthermore, IL-6 and LBP were the top biomarkers for prediction accuracy in our random forest model, highlighting the importance of managing microbial translocation in COVID-19 and its potential utility as a biomarker for disease severity.

IMPORTANCECOVID-19 continues to be a burden on public health. Understanding how plasma biomarkers differ between healthy and acutely infected individuals can help in understanding pathogenesis and predict disease severity. It has been demonstrated that COVID-19 disrupts the gut microbiome and intestinal permeability, which contributes to systemic inflammation. Our study highlights the link between gut barrier integrity and inflammation in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 cases, demonstrating the usefulness of gut barrier integrity biomarkers in predicting disease severity, and offers insights for therapeutic interventions in acute COVID-19 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

Much debate has hence surrounded their possible role as intermediate hosts in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, but the virological phenotypes of most pangolin coronaviruses (pCoVs) remain unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyze all pCoVs to date identified from trafficked pangolins seized in the Guangdong province of China, which are remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the spike protein. We explore an unknown genetic diversity within these viruses and uncover how this diversity translates to different virological phenotypes. Strikingly, several Guangdong pCoVs harbor a lysine substitution at residue 519 of spike protein, which contributes to marked immune evasion potentially by modulating the conformational state of spike protein. Furthermore, we highlight that a similar immuno-evasive mutation at residue 519 of the spike protein was acquired by SARS-CoV-2. These findings support that pangolin- and human-infecting coronaviruses represent independent spillover events from natural bat reservoirs, and that immuno-evasive mutations at residue 519 may be a common vector of viral evolution in coronaviruses that infect non-bat hosts.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

Off-target binding, defined as a probe binding to something other than the target gene, can distort a gene's true expression profile, making probe specificity essential for reliable transcriptomics. Here, we investigate off-target binding in the 10x Genomics Xenium v1 Human Breast Gene Expression Panel. We developed a software tool, Off-target Probe Tracker (OPT), to identify putative off-target binding via alignment of probe sequences and found at least 21 out of the 280 genes in the panel impacted by off-target binding to protein-coding genes. To substantiate our predictions, we leveraged a previously published Xenium breast cancer dataset generated using this gene panel and compared results to orthogonal spatial and single-cell transcriptomic profiles from Visium CytAssist and 3' single-cell RNA-seq derived from the same tumor block. Our findings indicate that for some genes, the expression patterns detected by Xenium demonstrably reflect the aggregate expression of the target and predicted off-target genes based on Visium and single-cell RNA-seq rather than the target gene alone. Overall, this work enhances the biological interpretability of spatial transcriptomics data and improves reproducibility in spatial transcriptomics research.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains carry filamentous phages called Pf that establish chronic infections and do not require host lysis to spread. However, spontaneous mutations in the Pf repressor gene (pf5r) can allow extreme phage production that slows bacterial growth and increases cell death, violating an apparent detente between bacterium and phage. We observed this paradoxical outcome in an evolution experiment with P. aeruginosa in media simulating nutrients from the cystic fibrosis airway. Bacteria containing pf5r mutant phage grow to a lower density but directly outcompete their ancestor and convert them into pf5r mutants via phage superinfection. Reduced fitness therefore spreads throughout the bacterial population, driven by weaponized Pf. Yet high intracellular phage replication facilitates another evolutionary conflict: cheater miniphages lacking capsid genes invade populations of full length phages within cells. Although bacteria containing both full-length phages and miniphages are most immune to superinfection by limiting the Pf receptor, this hybrid vigor is extremely unstable, as a classic Tragedy of the Commons scenario ensues that results in complete prophage loss. The entire cycle, from phage hyperactivation to miniphage invasion to prophage loss, can occur within 24h, showcasing rapid coevolution between bacteria and their filamentous phages. This study demonstrates that P. aeruginosa, and potentially many other bacterial species that carry filamentous prophages, risk being exploited by these phages in a runaway process that reduces fitness of both host and virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

An assessment of these sites revealed that many are enriched for single nucleotide variants that promote or eliminate FOS binding in human neurons.

Despite advances in collagen extraction protocols, the process remains destructive, requiring sampling by sawing, drilling or crushing of dry bone, that can damage or destroy physical features and archaeological evidence, and often consumes the entire specimen. While non-destructive approaches have recently been applied in ancient genomics and palaeoproteomics, no equivalent approach has been established for radiocarbon dating of bone. Here, we outline a non-destructive collagen extraction workflow that avoids invasive sampling (cutting or drilling) and produces no visible damage to the bone. By heating the bone in hot water for several hours, collagen is solubilized, and the resulting collagenous solution can be purified and AMS dated. Here we show that the amino acid composition, C/N atomic ratios, {delta}13C and {delta}15N values of the hot-water-extracted collagen are comparable to collagen isolated from the same bones using classic decalcification methodologies. The hot water extraction method was tested on various bones, ranging from the Bronze Age to the Middle and Upper Paleolithic periods, which had been dated previously using routine destructive methods that involved acid demineralization. Our results show that non-destructive collagen extraction, coupled with an additional purification step e.g., ultrafiltration, yields identical radiocarbon ages to those obtained via the routine destructive methods.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

Particularly for transcriptional enhancers, deep learning models excel at deciphering sequence features and grammar that underlie their spatiotemporal activity. To enable end-to-end enhancer modeling and design, we developed a software and modeling package, called CREsted. It combines preprocessing starting from single-cell ATAC-seq data; modeling with a choice of several architectures for training classification and regression models on either topics or pseudobulk peak heights; sequence design using multiple strategies; and downstream analysis through a collection of tools to locate transcription factor (TF) binding sites, infer the effect of a TF (activating or repressing) on enhancer accessibility, decipher enhancer grammar, and score gene loci. We demonstrate CREsted using a mouse cortex model that we validate using the BICCN collection of in vivo validated mouse brain enhancers. Classical enhancers in immune cells, including the IFNB1 enhanceosome are revisited using a PBMC model, and we assess the accuracy of TF binding site predictions with ChIP-seq. Additionally, we use CREsted to compare mesenchymal-like cancer cell states between tumor types; and we investigate different fine-tuning strategies of Borzoi within CREsted, comparing their performance and explainability with CREsted models trained from scratch. Finally, we train a CREsted model on a scATAC-seq atlas of zebrafish development and use this to design and in vivo validate cell type-specific synthetic enhancers in three tissues. For varying datasets, we demonstrate that CREsted facilitates efficient training and analyses, enabling scrutinization of the enhancer logic and design of synthetic enhancers across tissues and species.

In neural progenitor cells, examination of both cis and trans changes -- combined with CRISPR inhibition and transcription factor motif analyses -- identified cis-acting, species-specific gene regulatory changes, including to TNIK, FOSL2, and MAZ, with widespread trans effects on neurogenesis-related gene programs. In excitatory neurons, we identified POU3F2 as a key cis-regulated gene with trans effects on synaptic gene expression and neuronal firing.

Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.258.17, B.1.1.7, and BA.5.3.2 (termed wild-type, alpha and omicron, respectively) revealed that human astrocytes, not neurons, support viral proliferation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, new virus variants exhibited milder disease progression. A retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 infected by wild-type or alpha variants was conducted to test whether ketamine, an anaesthetic that inhibits endocytosis, affects COVID-19. At admission, patients infected with the wild-type showed greater disease severity than alpha variant patients, but the disease course was similar. This may be due to distinct ketamine-mediated SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effects, revealing stronger ketamine inhibition of the wild-type variant than the alpha variant mediating astrocyte responses involving the expression of ACE2, a viral cell entry site, viral proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and envelope protein-E in infected cells. Overexpression of SARS-CoV-2 protein 3a attenuated astroglial lysosomal traffic, and 3a and nsp6 differentially modulated lipid droplet accumulation and initiation of autophagy, where ketamine predominantly affected vesicle dynamics.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a large health claims database to investigate this risk.

We adjusted for age, sex, geographic location, depression, steroid use, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome, and anemia. Our cohort included 1,926 semaglutide users and 1,348 users of bupropion-naltrexone. The incidence of hair loss was higher among the semaglutide group than the active comparator, bupropion-naltrexone.

However, these areas' contributions to language remain unclear given that the evidence for their recruitment comes from diverse paradigms, many of which conflate language processing with perceptual, motor, or task-related cognitive processes. Using fMRI data from 772 participants performing an extensively-validated language localizer paradigm that isolates language processing from other processes, we a) delineate a comprehensive set of areas that respond reliably to language across written and auditory modalities, and b) evaluate these areas' selectivity for language relative to a demanding non-linguistic task. In line with prior claims, many areas outside the core fronto-temporal network respond during language processing, and most of them show selectivity for language relative to general task demands. These language-selective areas of the extended language network include areas around the temporal poles, in the medial frontal cortex, in the hippocampus, and in the cerebellum, among others. Although distributed across many parts of the brain, the extended language-selective network still only comprises ~1.2% of the brain's volume and is about the size of a strawberry, challenging the view that language processing is broadly distributed across the cortical surface. These newly identified language-selective areas can now be systematically characterized to decipher their contributions to language processing, including testing whether these contributions differ from those of the core language areas.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

However, it is unclear whether circulating glucose levels affect mood subconsciously or via subjectively sensed metabolic states. Here, we continuously monitored the interstitial glucose levels of 90 healthy adults for four weeks while they completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA; M=47 runs per participant) to rate their mood and metabolic states. As expected, hungry participants reported lower mood, and metabolic state ratings were associated with glucose levels. Although glucose levels were associated with mood, the metabolic state ratings fully mediated this association. Individual differences reflecting metabolic health (i.e., BMI and insulin resistance) did not affect the interaction between glucose and metabolic state ratings on mood. Notably, individuals with higher interoceptive accuracy had fewer fluctuations in mood ratings. We conclude that hunger-related mood shifts depend on conscious sensing of the body's internal state instead of acting subconsciously. Our study highlights the relevance of considering the self-report of bodily signals in understanding mood shifts, offering new fundamental insights into mood regulation mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

However, the dynamics of its transcriptional activity and replication during the life cycle within the bacteria is still relatively unknown. Here, we employed Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) to investigate the transcriptome and epitranscriptome landscape of the MS2 in infected E. coli throughout its life cycle and detailed the dynamics of MS2 replication in real-time. We discovered that MS2 phages sustain a high level of transcriptional activity within the bacterial cell. We found large amounts of subgenomic small RNA transcripts containing the coat-encoding region. We found hybrid reads and mutations due to the error-prone activity of the MS2 replicase complex. We evidenced that RNA modification is conserved throughout the entire life cycle in full-length transcripts without the acquisition of new modifications whereas small transcripts did acquire and remove modified sites. The conserved sequence (5''-{Psi}U-3'') and secondary structure (stem-loops) of {Psi} installation sites were the most amenable to RNA modification. Our investigation reveals a more complex transcriptional dynamics of MS2 phages within E. coli to maintain its growth and replicate under host pressure.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151814

The suppressive tumor microenvironment TME, characterized by complex interactions among immune and stromal cells, is gaining recognition in conferring resistance to CAR T cell therapy. Despite the abundance and diversity of macrophages in the TME, their intricate involvement in modulating responses to CAR T cell therapies remains poorly understood. Here, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA seq on tumors from 41 glioma patients undergoing IL13Ra2-targeted CAR T cell therapy, identifying elevated suppressive SPP1 signatures predominantly in macrophages from patients who were resistant to treatment. Further integrative scRNA seq analysis of high-grade gliomas as well as an interferon-signaling deficient syngeneic mouse model both resistant to CAR T therapy demonstrated the role of congruent suppressive pathways in mediating resistance to CAR T cells and a dominant role for SPP1+ macrophages. SPP1 blockade with an anti-SPP1 antibody abrogates the suppressive TME effects and substantially prolongs survival in IFN signaling-deficient and glioma syngeneic mouse models resistant to CAR T cell therapy. These findings illuminate the role of SPP1+ macrophages in fueling a suppressive TME and driving solid tumor resistance to CAR cell therapies.

Its surface offers a unique ecological niche for microbial colonization and serves as a primary habitat for degrading microorganisms. Despite the pivotal role microbial communities play in plastic degradation, there has been limited research on constructing stable, interacting microbial consortia. In this study, we explored the potential of evolving bacterial biofilm communities to enhance polyethylene degradation. Through long-term experimental evolution, six microbial populations underwent 40 selection cycles using polyethylene as their sole carbon source. The resulting evolved communities formed robust, multi-species biofilms with enhanced degradation capabilities, outperforming their ancestral populations in biofilm production. Pseudomonas stutzeri emerged as the dominant species, orchestrating a synergistic interaction with two other isolates through metabolic division of labor. (Meta)-transcriptomics analysis revealed that Pseudomonas primarily contributed to the expression of enzymes involved in microbe-mediated degradation of polyethylene, whereas the other community members were responsible for secreting extracellular polysaccharides, improving biofilm formation.

To address this gap, we systematically assessed the impact of isoform-level analysis across more than 100 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) datasets and 76 million human genetic variants. Using strict colocalization, we find that ~45% of genes associated with human phenotypes via Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) exhibit isoform-specific effects. Similarly, we find that 72% of rare pathogenic variants alter their interpretation depending on the isoform expressed in relevant tissues or cell types. These findings establish isoform-level analysis as an essential approach for genetic research.

Here, we elucidate the structural basis and evolutionary emergence of Lamassu, a bacterial immune system family featuring diverse effectors but a core conserved SMC-like sensor. Using cryo-EM, we determined structures of the Vibrio cholerae Lamassu complex in both apo- and dsDNA-bound states, revealing unexpected stoichiometry and topological architectures.

Here, upon proteomic analysis to identify common players in oncogenic EGFR- and KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma mouse models, we uncovered a largely unknown protein in cancer, flavin-containing monooxygenase 4 (FMO4), whose expression was increased in lung tumors compared with adjacent lung tissue. FMO4 expression was strongly increased also in lung cancer samples from patients compared with healthy lung, and its expression level was inversely correlated with overall survival. Remarkably, in vivo deletion of FMO4 greatly decreased tumor burden and increased survival in oncogenic KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma mice unveiling its crucial role in tumor biology. Mechanistically, we found that FMO4 loss of function promotes ferroptosis and cooperates with ferroptosis inducers in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, FMO4 facilitates the interaction between MAT2A and MAT2B, promoting the generation of cysteine from methionine, which in turn boosts the generation of glutathione, thus protecting lung adenocarcinoma against ferroptosis. In summary we identified a new target in lung adenocarcinoma with important implications in cancer biology.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Our analyses demonstrate that this method outperforms existing approaches, such as the Slow-Fast method, Tree Independent Generation of Evolutionary Rate approach, and Le Quesne Probability statistics, by removing fewer sites while still inferring phylogenies with comparable or greater accuracy. Implemented in IQ-TREE2, the trimmed log-likelihood method is user-friendly with a simple command-line interface. However, challenges remain in addressing heterogeneous evolutionary processes including compositional biases, such as GC bias. Despite these challenges, our approach offers a practical solution for improving phylogenetic inference by automatically and dynamically identifying sites to down-weight during phylogenetic analyses.

Single-cell DNA tracing microscopy and polymer physics-based simulations of genome folding have proposed these population-scale patterns arise from motor- driven, heterogeneous movement, rather than stable 3D genomic architecture, implying that motion, rather than structure, is key to understanding genome function. However, tools to directly observe this motion in vivo have been limited in coverage and resolution. Here we describe TRansposon Assisted Chromatin Kinetic Imaging Technology (TRACK-IT), which combines a suite of imaging and labeling improvements to achieve ultra-resolution in space and time, with self-mapping transposons to distribute labels across the chromosome, uncovering dynamic behaviors across four orders of magnitude of genomic separation. We find that sequences separated by sub-megabase distances, typically 200-500 nm of nanometers apart, can transition to close proximity in tens of seconds - faster than previously hypothesized. This rapid motion is dependent upon cohesin and is exhibited only within certain genomic domains. Domain borders act as kinetic impediments to this search process, substantially slowing the rate and frequency of the transition to proximity. The genomic separation-dependent scaling of the search time for cis-interactions within a domain violates predictions of diffusion, suggesting motor driven folding. This distinctive scaling is lost following cohesin depletion, replaced with a behavior consistent with diffusion. Finally, we found cohesin containing cells exhibited rare, processive movements, not seen in cohesin depleted cells. These processive trajectories exhibit extrusion rates of [~]2.7 kb/s across three distinct genomic intervals, faster than recent in vitro measurements and prior estimates from in vivo data. Taken together, these results reveal a genome in motion across multiple genomic and temporal scales, where motor-dependent extrusion divides the sequence, not into spatially separate domains, but into kinetically separated domains that experience accelerated local search.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

With the status of PMI funding and operations currently uncertain, this study aimed to quantify the impact that a fully-functioning PMI would have on malaria cases and deaths in Africa during 2025.

MethodsWe combined detailed spatio-temporal information on planned 2025 PMI and non-PMI malaria commodity procurement and distribution in Africa with spatio-temporal Bayesian models of intervention coverage and Plasmodium falciparum transmission and burden in Africa. By comparing coverage scenarios with and without planned PMI contributions we estimated the number of malaria cases and deaths PMI would avert in 2025.

FindingsWe estimated that business-as-usual PMI contributions to vector control, seasonal chemoprevention, and routine malaria treatment in Africa would avert in 2025 14{middle dot}9M (95% uncertainty interval 12{middle dot}5M - 17{middle dot}8M) malaria cases and 107,000 (71,000 - 166,000) deaths. This represents 12{middle dot}6% (11{middle dot}1 - 14{middle dot}2%) and 39{middle dot}0% (37{middle dot}1 - 40{middle dot}4%), respectively, of the total burden of malaria morbidity and mortality in PMIs focus geographies across 27 African countries. These estimates do not account for the additional impact of PMI-supported provision of diagnostics or severe case management commodities, nor preventive treatment for pregnant women which would add further to the averted burden.

InterpretationPMI investment in supporting procurement and distribution of malaria control commodities would translate directly into millions of malaria cases averted and a hundred thousand lives saved across its focus geographies in Africa across 2025.

FundingNational Health and Medical Research Council, Australia

Research in context

Evidence before this studyWe searched PubMed on 25 February 2025 with the search term ""Presidents Malaria Initiative"" AND (impact OR evaluation) AND (burden OR malaria cases OR malaria deaths). 102 results were returned, of which four directly addressed the question of PMI-attributable impact on malaria burden across all its focus geographies. One focussed solely on case-management and did not provide quantitative results1. A study focussing on mortality found a strong association between PMI investment and declines in all-cause infant mortality2. Another study used a generalised estimating equation approach to assess PMIs impact, concluding a strong association between PMI spending and reductions in malaria burden3. A 2017 study used a mechanistic malaria model to estimate PMIs historic contribution to reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality, with future projections to 20204.

Added value of this studyIn this study we synthesised the most up-to-date information of all-funder volumes of key malaria control interventions (ITN, IRS, ACT, SMC) with PMI data on planned volumes and spatial targeting of funding in 2025 to derive near-real-time projections of malaria control intervention coverage in Africa under two scenarios: a business-as-usual scenario in which PMI commodities procured and distributed as previously planned versus a  no-PMI scenario in which PMI funding and technical assistance is absent. These scenario-based estimates of coverage were propagated through an empirical geospatial malaria model, coupled to mechanistic models of clinical incidence, in order to estimate the number of malaria infections, clinical cases, and deaths PMI activities could expect to avert in Africa in 2025.

Implications of all available evidencePMI is a key contributor to malaria control efforts in Africa, and as such its impact on averting childhood mortality has been demonstrated repeatedly. Here, using empirically-derived estimates of malaria control impact, combined with detailed scenarios of intervention coverage with- and without-PMI support, we isolated the contemporary impact of PMI activities on malaria morbidity and mortality in Africa in 2025. Our findings suggest that PMI support is critical to maintaining suppression of malaria transmission in its focus geographies.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

Both options place patients on an irreversible pathway that risks harm from further surgery. AF may predispose patients to subsequent hindfoot joint fusion and TAR is associated with high rates of complex revision surgery. The aim is to improve decision making by investigating the risks of further surgery, adjacent joint surgery and rare but serious complications of AF versus TAR.

MethodsAn England population cohort study was performed using the Hospital Episode Statistics database, linked to ONS mortality data (19982023). The primary outcome was Kaplan Meier curve analysis of revision surgery free survival of TAR versus AF. Secondary outcome measures were the rates of adjacent joint/hindfoot fusion, any further reintervention to the ankle, perioperative mortality, 90 day complications, and serious adverse events.

Results10,335 TAR and 30,704 AF were analysed. The AF revision rate was significantly lower than TAR at all time points including; 5 years (2% vs 6.1%, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.16), 10 years (2.5% vs 10.2%, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.18) and 20 years (3.1% vs 13.55%, RR 0.12; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.23).

There was no significant difference in 25 year risk of adjacent joint fusion following AF (8.64%, 95% CI 7.79% to 9.58%) versus TAR (6.82%; 95% CI 5.36% to 8.66%). TAR was associated with higher risks of intra operative fracture (0.42% vs 0.10%, RR = 4.35) and reintervention for wound infection (0.26% vs 0.15%, RR 1.74) but fewer pulmonary emboli (0.23% vs 0.58%, RR = 0.40).

ConclusionBoth TAR and AF are safe definitive treatments of ankle arthritis with low perioperative risk. TAR is associated with a significantly higher rate of further revision surgery than AF. AF does not predispose patients to hindfoot fusion surgery.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

The emergence of the ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis (AMS) was followed by the diversification of alternative mycorrhizal types, including the ericoid mycorrhizae (ErM)3. The evolution of ErM coincides with the emergence of the Ericaceae family of angiosperms and the diversification of leafy liverworts within the order Jungermanniales, as well as their expansion into boreal and high-altitude ecosystem4-6. Despite their evolutionary and ecological relevance, little is known about the molecular and genomic basis of ErM. Here, we sequenced the nuclear genomes of two leafy liverworts from Jungermanniales, and reconstituted ErM under laboratory conditions. We demonstrated the existence of a nutrient-regulated symbiotic state that enables ErM and underlies intracellular colonization of plant tissues. Genome and functional analyses revealed that leafy liverworts retain a conserved suite of functional genes that are required for endosymbiosis in land plants. Comparative transcriptomic analysis under ErM-permissive and restrictive conditions identified gene modules associated with endosymbiosis. Transcriptome sequencing cross-comparisons of ErM and AMS identified a conserved gene module required for the intracellular accommodation of fungal symbionts, marking it as a shared feature across diverse types of land plant symbioses. Our study presents the first genomic resources for leafy liverworts, and provides the first experimental evidence that ErM evolved from AMS. This evolutionary transition involved the co-option of a nutrient-based mechanism for the establishment of ErM, and additionally the co-option of two gene modules essential for signaling and symbiont accommodation during endosymbiosis. Our data offer valuable insights and resources for understanding the molecular basis of ErM and its diversification from AMS in land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Here, by screening available apusomonad 'omics data we found genes of a distinct group of microbial rhodopsins, the ApuRs. ApuRs heterologously expressed in mammalian cells absorbed near-UV/violet or blue light, suggesting that ApuRs could be involved in apusomonads' photoavoidance response. Electrophysiological measurements indicate that ApuRs are anion-selective rhodopsin channels which evolved independently of the family of channelrhodopsins widespread in other unicellular eukaryotes. Among the known rhodopsin channels, ApuRs collectively demonstrate the most blue-shifted absorption spectra. In ApuRs, the channel opening is triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal from its all-trans form to 13-cis and 11-cis forms. We found that intracellular proton transfer is involved in channel opening and determined the channel's open/close kinetics. These findings expand our understanding of the photobiology of heterotrophic flagellates and showcase the significance of these organisms as a source of new rhodopsin families with unanticipated functions.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

To better understand the mechanism of antidepressant response to TMS, we recruited two neurosurgical patients with indwelling electrodes and delivered TMS pulses to the DLPFC while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the sgACC. Spectral analysis revealed a decrease in high-frequency activity (HFA; 70-180 Hz) after each stimulation pulse, which was especially pronounced in the sgACC relative to other regions.

Accordingly, previous slice physiology experiments in hippocampal area CA1 showed that mGluRIII receptors inhibit glutamate and GABA release only at excitatory and inhibitory synapses formed onto GABAergic interneurons, not onto pyramidal cells. Here, we show that the supposed target cell-specific modulation of GABA release only occurs when the extracellular calcium concentration in the recording solution is higher than its physiological concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. Under more physiological conditions, mGluRIII receptors inhibit GABA release at synapses formed onto both interneurons and pyramidal cells but limit glutamate release only onto interneurons. This previously unrecognized form of mGluRIII-dependent, pre-synaptic modulation of inhibition onto pyramidal cells is accounted for by a reduction in the size of the readily releasable pool, mediated by protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated target proteins, synapsins. Using in vivo whole-cell recordings in behaving mice, we demonstrate that blocking mGluRIII activation in the intact CA1 network results in net effects consistent with decreased inhibition and significantly alters CA1 place cell activity.

The flexibility and scalability of this approach offer a promising framework to bridge between more animal models, comparing quantitative imaging modalities, and disease phenotypes.

Among these, the CRISPR-Cas system has been extensively studied and harnessed as a revolutionary gene editing tool. However, while the biochemical process by which this microbial immune system acquires genetic CRISPR memory and immunity against invaders has been comprehensively examined, fundamental questions about the bacterial physiological state underlying how and when CRISPR memory is formed have only been partially explored. Naive CRISPR adaptation is generally rare, but occurs more frequently when bacteria are challenged with replication-deficient phages. In such scenarios, bacteria are not under immediate threat and have ample time to adapt to the phage DNA, without risking cell death. Accordingly, slow growth caused by low temperatures, low aeration, or bacteriostatic antibiotics promotes CRISPR adaptation, possibly by allowing the Cas complexes more time to adapt before being outpaced. Persister cells are dormant antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations of cells with limited metabolic activity. When a mobile genetic element invades a persister cell, its replication is halted until the host cell resumes growth, providing an ideal opportunity for CRISPR adaptation. Here, we show that transiently dormant Escherichia coli persister cells acquire CRISPR immunity 10-fold more frequently than the general bacterial population. Thus, persister cells, in addition to being notoriously antibiotic tolerant, are primed for CRISPR-Cas adaptation and may be in a state of heightened immune capacity and evolution, securing the survival of the population.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Here, we use a gene expression cartography algorithm, called Novosparc, to reconstruct the spatial distribution of gene expression and cell type localization in a complex, yet tractable, developing brain structure, the Drosophila optic lobe. We generate a three-dimensional atlas of this structure, which we made available through a dedicated website (https://larva3dnovosparc.ijm.fr). This allowed us to identify spatially compartmentalized cell types and spatially patterned genes, to predict hotspots of neuronal cell death and identify the expression of neuronal type-defining transcription factors. Importantly, we identify caveats in such algorithms that could allow for the development of refined versions. Altogether, this work provides an invaluable tool for brain researchers to formulate hypotheses and paves the way for the generation of three-dimensional atlases of more complex brain structures, which will enhance our understanding of how neurons with diverse developmental lineages can integrate to form a functional brain.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

High-throughput metagenomic sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into the structure and function of these communities. However, functional profiling of metagenomes remains constrained due to the limited sensitivity of existing sequence homology-based methods to annotate evolutionarily divergent genes. Protein structure, which is more conserved than sequence and intrinsically tied to molecular function, offers a solution. Capitalising on recent breakthroughs in structural bioinformatics, we present EcoFoldDB, a database of protein structures curated for ecologically relevant microbial traits, and its companion pipeline, EcoFoldDB-annotate, which leverages Foldseek with the ProstT5 protein language model for rapid structural homology searching directly from sequence data. EcoFoldDB-annotate outperforms state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in annotating metagenomic protein sequences, in terms of both sensitivity and precision. To demonstrate its utility and scalability, we performed structure-guided functional profiling of 32 million proteins encoded by 8,000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from the global soil microbiome. EcoFoldDB-annotate could resolve the phylogenetic partitioning of important nitrogen cycling pathways, from taxonomically restricted nitrifiers to more widespread denitrifiers, as well as identifying novel, uncultivated bacterial taxa enriched in plant growth-promoting traits. We anticipate that EcoFoldDB will enable researchers to extract ecological insights from environmental genomes and metagenomes, and accelerate discoveries in microbial ecology.

Extracellular Argonautes have been reported across plants, animals and protozoa yet their biochemical and functional properties remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that an extracellular Argonaute (exWAGO) released by the rodent-infective parasitic nematode Heligmosomoides bakeri is detectable inside mouse cells during the natural infection. We further show that exWAGO is released from H.bakeri in both vesicular and non-vesicular forms that have different resistances to proteolysis, different accessibilities to antibodies and associate with different subsets of secondary siRNAs. Using recombinant exWAGO protein we demonstrate that non-vesicular exWAGO is directly internalised by mouse cells in vitro and that immunisation of mice with exWAGO confers partial protection against subsequent H. bakeri infection and generates antibodies that block exWAGO uptake into cells. Finally, we show that properties of exWAGO are conserved across Clade V nematodes that infect humans and livestock. Together this work expands the context in which Argonautes function and illuminates an RNA-binding protein as a vaccine target for parasitic nematodes.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Many of these damaging modifications (i.e., lesions) persist into S-phase of the cell cycle where they may stall the canonical DNA replication machinery. In humans, these stalling events are circumvented by one of at least three interconnected DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways; translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), Template Switching (TS), and Homology-dependent Recombination (HDR). Currently, the functional interplay between these pathways is unclear, leaving wide gaps in our fundamental understanding of human DDT. To gain insights, we focus on the activation mechanisms of the DDT pathways. PCNA sliding clamps encircling primer/template (P/T) junctions of stalled replication sites are central to the activation of both TLS and TS whereas exchange of RPA for Rad51 filaments on the single strand DNA (ssDNA) sequences of stalled replication sites is central to HDR activation. Utilizing direct, ensemble FRET approaches developed by our lab, we independently monitor and directly compare PCNA occupancy and RPA/Rad51 exchange at P/T junctions under a variety of conditions that mimic in vivo scenarios. Collectively, the results reveal that assembly of stable Rad51 filaments at P/T junctions via RPA/Rad51 exchange causes complete and irreversible unloading of the resident PCNA, both in the presence and absence of an abundant PCNA-binding protein complex. Further investigations decipher the mechanism of RPA/Rad51 exchange-dependent unloading of PCNA. Collectively, these studies provide critical insights into the interplay between human DDT pathways and direction for future studies.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, known as savings, remain unclear. Recent studies propose that the high dimensionality of neural control enables the retention of learning traces that may facilitate savings. To test this idea we used MotorNet, a framework for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to control biomechanical models of the human upper limb. RNNs were trained to perform reaching movements with a velocity-dependent force field (FF) and without (NF) in the sequence NF1 (baseline), FF1 (adaptation), NF2 (washout), and FF2 (re-adaptation). RNNs showed behavioural signatures of savings in the absence of any explicit contextual input signalling the presence or absence of the FF. Savings was more robust in RNNs with larger numbers of units. We identified a component of RNN activity associated with savings--a shift in preparatory activity that persisted even after washout. Displacing this preparatory activity in the direction of the shift enhanced savings, whereas perturbations in the opposite direction reduced or eliminated savings. These findings suggest a potential neural basis for motor memory retention underlying savings that is reliant on the high dimensionality of neural space, and is independent of cognitive or strategic learning.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

We found that populations that followed this two-stage strategy achieved higher payoffs in the long term than populations using the two exploration strategies in a random order. Our models point at a  just right length of childhood - neither too long, nor too short - allowing individuals enough time to explore before exploiting what they learned. Social learning increased payoffs when agents could copy individuals of a variety of ages. Payoffs decreased under environmental change, especially for long childhoods, because adults did not have enough time to recover between bouts of change.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Epidemiological studies reveal that epilepsy is more prevalent in males, with lesional types being more common, whereas idiopathic generalized epilepsies are more frequently observed in females. These differences stress the importance of considering sex-specific factors in epilepsy diagnosis, treatment, and mechanistic research using preclinical models. To elucidate potential molecular differences that could explain these disparities and inform personalized treatment strategies, we conducted a proteomic analysis of epileptic brain tissues from both an experimental mouse model of genetic epilepsy and humans with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE).

MethodsWe employed mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis on brain tissues from DRE patients and the Pten knockout (KO) mouse model of genetic epilepsy with focal cortical dysplasia. Mouse samples included hippocampi from adult wild-type (WT) and Pten KO mice (4-5 per group and sex). Human samples included temporal cortex from 12 DRE adult patients (7 males, 5 females) and 5 non-epileptic (NE) controls (2 males, 3 females). Brain biopsies were collected with patients informed consent under approved IRB protocols (Indiana University Health Biorepository). Proteomic profiles were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) along with volcano plots to identify significant changes in protein expression. The enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins was conducted by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway.

ResultsPCA revealed distinct clustering of brain proteomes between epilepsy and control cases in both human and mice, with 390 proteins showing significant differences in human and 437 proteins in mouse samples. These proteins are primarily associated with ion channels, synaptic processes, and neuronal energy regulation. In the mouse model, males have more pronounced proteomic changes than females, with enrichment in metabolic pathways and VEGF signaling pathway, indicating a more severe vascular permeability impairment in males. In human DRE cases, 118 proteins were significantly changed by comparing epileptic females to males. Pathway analysis revealed changes in metabolic pathways and the HIF-1 signaling pathway, indicating that altered neuronal activity and inflammation may lead to increased oxygen consumption.

ConclusionThese findings highlight significant differences between epilepsy and control brain samples in both humans and mice. Sex-specific analysis revealed distinct pathway enrichments between females and males, with males exhibiting a broader range of alterations, suggesting more extensive proteomic alterations. This study offers valuable insights into potential underlying mechanisms of epilepsy and underscores the importance of considering sex as a key factor in epilepsy research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Mating signals for mate choice or competition in the hybridizing species can mediate heterospecific mating, thus predicting the extent and direction of gene flow in the entangled evolutionary trajectories. Some mating signals are diffusive, facilitating gene flow across species boundaries; some asymmetrically mediate gene flow from one species to another; while others prevent hybridization and strengthen species boundaries. Here we investigate the role of mating signals in mediating gene flow at nascent species boundaries. By comparatively studying the mating signals of 109 hybridizing avian species pairs, we discovered: (1) the visual, acoustic, kinesthetic, and chemosensory signaling modalities are associated with their roles in the species boundaries; (2) the relative energetic expenditure of mating signals predicts the directionality of gene flow between species; (3) the effects of mating signals on species boundaries are associated with mitochondrial genetic distance. This synthesis highlights the significant role of mating signal energetics in shaping the grey zone of avian speciation.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

The study objective was to determine if the Hurst exponent (H) - an estimate of the self-correlation and signal complexity - of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal is correlated with the excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) ratio. E:I has been proposed to serve as a control parameter for brain criticality - the theory that the brain operates near a critical point between order and disorder, optimizing information processing and adaptability - which H is believed to be a measure of. Thus, understanding if H and E:I are correlated would clarify this relationship. Moreover, findings in this domain have implications for neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions with disrupted E:I balance, such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. From a practical perspective, H is easier to accurately measure than E:I ratio at 3T MRI. If H can serve as a proxy for E:I, it may serve as a more practical clinical biomarker for this imbalance and for neuroscience research in general. The study collected functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy data during rest and movie-watching. H was found to increase with movie-watching compared to rest, while E:I (glutamate/GABA) did not change between conditions. H and E:I were not correlated during either movie-watching or rest. This study represents the first attempt to investigate this connection in vivo in humans. We conclude that, at 3T and with our particular methodologies, no association was found. We end with lessons learned and suggestions for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Objective: To determine the impact of EoE inflammatory mediators upon mitochondrial biology in esophageal epithelium, the mechanisms mediating these effects, and their functional significance to EoE pathobiology. Methods: Mitochondria were evaluated in human biopsies, MC903/Ovalbumin-induced murine EoE, and human esophageal keratinocytes. Esophageal keratinocytes were treated with EoE-relevant cytokines and JAK/STAT inhibitor ruxolitinib. To deplete mitochondria, 3D organoids generated from TFAMloxp/loxp mice were subjected ex vivo to Cre or siRNA against Transcription factor A, mitochondria (TFAM) was transfected into esophageal keratinocytes. Mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and superoxide levels were measured. Results: We find evidence of increased mitochondria in esophageal epithelium of patients with EoE and mice with EoE-like inflammation. In esophageal keratinocytes, IL-4 and IL-13 increase mitochondrial mass. IL-13 increases mitochondrial biogenesis in a JAK/STAT-dependent manner. In 3D organoids, IL-13 limits squamous cell differentiation (SCD), and this is blunted upon TFAM depletion. IL-13 decreases mitochondrial respiration and superoxide level, although mitochondria remain intact. IL-13-mediated suppression of superoxide was abrogated upon TFAM depletion in esophageal keratinocytes. Conclusions: We report that increased mitochondrial mass is a feature of EoE. Among EoE-relevant cytokines, IL-13 is the primary driver of increased mitochondrial mass in esophageal keratinocytes by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis in a JAK/STAT-dependent manner. IL-13-mediated accumulation of mitochondria impairs SCD in esophageal keratinocytes and also suppresses oxidative stress, a factor that is known to induce SCD. These findings identify a novel mechanism through which IL-13 promotes EoE-associated epithelial remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

We found differences in immune responses, such as increased IL1{beta} production in rural Indonesians and impaired IFN{gamma} production by innate lymphocytes after TLR8 stimulation. In Europeans vaccinated with mRNA-1273, baseline IFN{gamma} production by innate lymphocytes correlated with SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific immune responses. In vitro mRNA vaccine stimulation also induced IFN{gamma} production, which was TLR8-dependent and reduced in rural Indonesians.

In addition, O. vulgaris is a short-lived semelparous species with a long spawning period. Therefore, monitoring ovary maturation in cultured octopuses can be useful in the scheduling of hatchery operations and management of culture resources. The present work aimed to assess the ovary maturity status in cultured and wild common octopus by means of a noninvasive technique, ultrasonography, to anticipate the time of spawning in aquaculture. A total of 27 octopuses (15 cultured and 12 wild ones) in different ovarian maturation stages were used in ultrasonographic procedures. Ultrasound-based ovary volumes were compared with real ovarian volumes and then the ultrasonography-based gonadosomatic index (GSIU) was estimated. Data from cultured females indicate that GSIU was initially below 0.3 cm3 per 100 g of body weight in immature animals, and attained a fast increase until reaching about 4.0 cm3 per 100 g of body weight right before spawning. The steep increase in relative volume occurred similarly in females of different body weights. In addition, the specific growth rate of cultured animals decreases with time, and with GSIU. Lastly, a linear mixed model indicated a significantly negative and logarithmic relationship between the time to spawning and GSIU in captive females. That relationship will be useful to predict spawning time in immature and maturing females, helping in the management of octopus broodstocks in research and production facilities.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

By incorporating these properties, we can gain deeper insights beyond basic alignments. Here we use, for the first time, a detailed physico-chemical description of kinases to identify class-specific structural regions, supporting an unsupervised classification method capable of classifying previously unlabeled kinases. This novel approach aligns with existing phylogeny-based classifications while offering refinements and enhanced accuracy. Ultimately, we use machine learning techniques to classify unlabeled kinases, validated by analyzing class-specific structural regions. This new classification approach goes beyond current rankings and can be applied to any type of protein, such as immunoglobulins and G protein-coupled receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

However, early markers of this process are in high demand. Multiple studies have reported changes in ribosomal protein (RP) expression during neurodegeneration, but the significance of these changes remains unclear. Ribosomes are evolutionarily conserved protein synthesizing machines, and although commonly viewed as invariant, accumulating evidence suggest functional ribosome specialization through variation in their protein composition. By analyzing cell type-specific translating mRNAs from mouse brains, we identify distinct RP expression patterns between neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, including neuron-specific RPs, Rpl13a and Rps10. We also observed complex expression relationships between RP paralogs and their canonical counterparts, suggesting regulated mechanisms for generating heterogeneous ribosomes. Analysis across brain regions revealed that Rplp0 and Rpl13a, commonly used normalization references, show heterogeneous expression, raising important methodological considerations for gene expression studies. Importantly, we show that Rps24, an essential ribosome component that undergoes alternative splicing to produce protein variants with different C-termini, exhibits striking cell type-specific isoform expression in brain. The Rps24c isoform is predominantly expressed in microglia and is increased by neuroinflammation caused by aging, neurodegeneration, or inflammatory chemicals. We verify increased expression of S24-PKE, the protein variant encoded by Rps24c, in brains with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, and relevant mouse models, using isoform-specific antibodies. These findings establish heterogeneous RP expression as a feature of brain cell types and identify Rps24c/S24-PKE as a novel marker for neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

Yet how enhancers determine transcription of their target genes, and how this depends on their relative position inside a cis-regulatory landscape remains unclear. Here we use live-cell imaging to track the activity of a promoter under the control of the same enhancer, but inserted at different positions across a simplified regulatory landscape with minimal complexity. Combined with mathematical modeling, this reveals that RNA production from the promoter occurs in clusters of transcriptional bursts, with enhancer position controlling the frequency at which such clusters appear. This results in bursts being more frequent and occurring more uniformly across cells when the enhancer is genomically close to the promoter than when it is located at large genomic distance. Mathematical modeling further indicates that the enhancer modulates the promoters ability to transition from its basal transcriptional state to a regime where clusters of bursts become more frequent. Our results challenge existing models of mammalian promoter operation, and reveal that enhancer position within a cis-regulatory landscape critically controls the timing and variability of transcriptional output in single cells.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Two factors that likely contribute to this situation include (a) conceptual disagreement about language and its component processes, and (b) intrinsic inter-individual variability in the topography of language areas. Recent functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies of small numbers of intensively scanned individuals have argued that a language-selective brain network emerges from correlations (individualized functional connectomics, iFC) in task-free (e.g., rest) or task-regressed activation timecourses. Here we test this hypothesis at scale and evaluate its practical utility for task-agnostic language localization: we apply iFC separately to each of 1,971 (fMRI) scanning sessions (1,199 unique brains), each consisting of diverse tasks. We find that iFC indeed reveals a left-lateralized frontotemporal network that is more stable within individuals than between them, robust to the granularity of the parcellation, and selective for language. These results support the hypothesis that this network is a key structure in the functional organization of the adult brain and show that it can be recovered retrospectively from arbitrary imaging data, with implications for neuroscience, neurosurgery, and neural engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Heterochromatin erosion is a hallmark of human ageing and H3K9me3 is lost globally in aged mammalian cells. However, the functional consequences of the loss of heterochromatin maintenance have been challenging to model. In this study, we used CRISPRi-mediated deletion of the H3K9me3 methyltransferase SETDB1 in human neural progenitor cells to model disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Deletion of SETDB1 had a limited effect on cell viability, despite a global loss of H3K9me3 peaks resulting in genome-wide reorganization of heterochromatin domains, cells remained proliferative and expressed appropriate marker genes. We found that a key event following the loss of H3K9me3 maintenance was the expression of evolutionarily young L1 retrotransposons. Derepression of L1s was associated with a loss of CpG DNA methylation at their promoters, suggesting that deposition of H3K9me3 at the L1 promoter is required to maintain DNA methylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that loss of H3K9me3 in human neural somatic cells transcriptionally activates evolutionary young L1 retrotransposons, further implicating these elements in human ageing processes.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

MethodsData were extracted from linked administrative healthcare claims and electronic health records (EHR) for vaccinations from 23 August 2024 through 24 December 2024 and followed through 31 December 2024. We conducted a retrospective matched cohort study with propensity score weighting to adjust for differences between groups to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID-19 outcomes. VE was calculated as 1 minus the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsOverall, 465,073 mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine recipients were matched 1:1 to unexposed adults. The mean (standard deviation) age was 63 (17) years, with more than half of the population being 65 years or older. Approximately 70% of individuals had an underlying medical condition making them high risk for severe outcomes for COVID-19. VE was 52.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.8%, 65.8%) against COVID-19-related hospitalization and 39.4% (35.0%, 43.5%) against medically attended COVID-19 over a median follow-up of 57 (interquartile range: 33-78) days.

ConclusionThe mRNA-1273 KP.2 vaccine demonstrated significant incremental effectiveness in preventing hospitalization with COVID-19 and medically attended COVID-19 in adults during the 2024-2025 season to date. These findings support ongoing vaccination efforts to mitigate the public health impact of COVID-19.

A common theme is generating a nucleotide-derived second messenger in response to phage that activates an effector protein to halt virion production. Phages respond with counter-defenses that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we discover a novel antiphage system we call Panoptes that detects phage infection by surveying the cytosol for phage proteins that antagonize the nucleotide-derived second messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE. OptS is predicted to synthesize a second messenger using a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in Type III CRISPR systems (Cas10) that is distantly related to GGDEF and Thg1 tRNA repair polymerase domains. OptE is predicted to be a transmembrane effector protein that binds cyclic nucleotides. optSE potently restricted phage replication but mutant phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-CBASS protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defense. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ""sponge"" that antagonizes second messenger signaling. Using genetic and biochemical assays, we found that Acb2 bound the OptS-synthesized nucleotide, 2',3'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (2',3'-c-di-AMP); however, 2',3'-c-di-AMP was synthesized constitutively by OptS and inhibited OptE. Nucleotide depletion by Acb2 released OptE toxicity thereby initiating abortive infection to halt phage replication. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that hosts use to guard their second messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

The plant microbiota is generally taxonomically structured. Some of the members can promote plant fitness including growth and stress tolerance. However, microbial imbalance can also result in deleterious effects, a phenomenon known as dysbiosis that was first coined in the gut microbiome field. To unveil the regulatory mechanism to maintain plant homeostatic interaction with microbiota, we performed screening using defined synthetic bacterial communities. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant with altered microbial profiles, an overall increase of microbial load and microbiota-dependent growth defects. Transcriptomic and chemical complementation analyses confirmed that the aforementioned microbiota-dependent phenotypes are contributed by an upregulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway. Upregulation of the jasmonate pathway further promotes microbial growth, possibly forming a positive feedback loop. Even though activation of the jasmonate signaling pathway is known to enhance plant stress tolerance, hyperactivation of the pathway alters plant tolerance or resistance against multiple stressors. Plant association with the microbiota together with proper regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway are thus essential to maintain plant response to environmental stressors.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

Understanding the functions of vocal mimicry can help to uncover the evolutionary drivers of vocal learning. Different adaptive functions like interspecific and intraspecific communication have been suggested, as well as the possibility of vocal mimicry to be a mistake during vocal learning. In the present study, we review the occurrence of mimicry in the family of corvids and investigate the socio-ecological factors driving the evolution of vocal mimicry in this group of birds. We recorded evidence of vocal mimicry from primary (xeno-canto recordings) as well as secondary sources (published literature) and found evidence for vocal mimicry in 31 out of 128 corvid species (24%). Smaller species were described as mimics more compared to larger species. Other socio-ecological factors like breeding status, habitat and trophic niche did not have a significant effect. More mimicry was recorded during the non-breeding season compared to the breeding season. We used Bayesian modelling based on existing data from primary and secondary sources to estimate the occurrence of mimicry, suggesting that vocal mimicry may be more widespread among corvids than currently documented, with many species potentially being  hidden mimics. Our study for the first time systematically reviews the occurrence of vocal mimicry across the family of corvids and investigates a range of socio-ecological factors driving the behaviour. Our analysis suggests many corvid species likely to be  hidden mimics and we provide specific suggestions for species which according to our statistical model are most likely mimicking corvid species, hopefully inspiring future field work on those species.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

In a surprising inversion of this process, we show here that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that maintains cell health. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TM{beta}. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TM{beta}-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse.

We introduce Exai-1, a multi-modal, transformer-based generative foundation model that integrates RNA sequence embeddings with cfRNA abundance data to capture biologically meaningful representations of circulating RNAs. By leveraging both sequence and expression modalities, Exai-1 captures a biologically meaningful latent structure of cfRNA profiles. Pre-trained on over 306 billion tokens from 8,339 samples, Exai-1 enhances signal fidelity, reduces technical noise, and improves disease detection by generating synthetic cfRNA profiles. We show that self-attention and variational inference are particularly important for preservation of biological signals and contextual relationships. Additionally, Exai-1 facilitates cross-biofluid translation and assay compatibility through disentangling biological signals from confounders. By uniting sequence-informed embeddings with cfRNA expression patterns, Exai-1 establishes a transfer learning foundation for liquid biopsy, offering a scalable and adaptable framework for next-generation cfRNA-based diagnostics.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

We previously observed that during experimental evolution in the presence of abundant susceptible hosts, the AMR plasmid R1 rapidly evolves variants with increased horizontal transmission due to mutations causing increased plasmid copy number. Yet AMR was progressively lost from the evolving populations. Here, we show that AMR loss was associated with evolution of  stealth plasmids in which the AMR region is spontaneously deleted, making plasmid carriage undetectable by plating on selective antibiotic-containing media. These plasmids transmit both vertically and horizontally more efficiently than the ancestral AMR plasmid, driving AMR extinction in bacterial populations and effectively acting as an intrinsic defence against AMR plasmids. Our results suggest that within-host plasmid evolution could be exploited to limit the spread of AMR in natural populations of bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules contribute to defense against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented, as their contribution to host defense has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we have taken advantage of newly-described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable, homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. With this new set of lines, we assessed the individual and collective contribution of each module to host defense against five viruses, three fungi, eight Gram-positive bacteria, and eight Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings show that these four modules largely function independently or additively in host defense, although synergistic effects can occur for select pairs of modules. Our study confirmed the importance of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and the Toll pathway against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, largely via the induction of effectors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Bomanins (Bom), but also reveals an important role of melanization against viruses, and a contribution of phagocytosis against various germs. Additionally, by examining microbial load kinetics in different mutants, we provide insight into how these modules contribute to tolerance or resistance against specific microbes. Our study provides insights into the architecture of the Drosophila immune system, revealing differential requirements of immune modules according to each pathogen. The set of immune deficient lines provided here offers tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

However, its precise chromosomal composition has remained elusive due to challenges in resolving repetitive regions. Using PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, we assembled the complete nuclear genome of the Dm28c strain into 32 telomere-to-telomere chromosomes. The assembly revealed conserved chromosomal structures and synteny patterns when compared to the independently sequenced Dm25 strain, both of which belong to clade A (TcI). This indicates that the 32-chromosome karyotype is a stable and conserved feature of T. cruzi. Through a comprehensive annotation pipeline, we refined gene content and resolved haplotypes, resulting in an approximately 25% reduction in core gene redundancy. All chromosomes demonstrate a conserved compartmentalized architecture consisting of core, disruptive, and newly characterized subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeres, enriched in RHS, TS, and DGF-1 genes but lacking MASP and mucins, create a distinct third genomic compartment. Telomere analysis showed significant length heterogeneity, which may influence subtelomeric gene regulation. Overall, this work defines the complete chromosomal complement of T. cruzi, establishing a solid framework for comparative genomics and enabling detailed studies into genome organization, antigenic variability, and evolutionary dynamics across strains and clades.

This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of microbial communities inhabiting heritage artifacts from Argentinas Museum of Independence. By integrating advanced microscopy with phenotypic and genomic characterization, we analyzed samples collected from wooden objects, textiles, architectural elements, and exterior walls. Scanning electron microscopy revealed diverse and well-structured biofilms, with intricate three-dimensional arrangements embedded in extracellular polymeric substances. A total of 49 bacterial strains were isolated and identified via VITEK MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, with a predominance of Gram-positive genera such as Bacillus, Micrococcus, and Kocuria. Remarkably, the 19th-century albumen print photograph emerged as the most biodiverse artifact, yielding 21 distinct strains, including Streptomyces, Oceanobacillus, and thermophilic Caldibacillus thermoamylovorans. The protein-rich and halophilic environment of the albumen layer likely facilitated microbial colonization and persistence. Pseudomonas species were exclusively associated with this photographic substrate, further underscoring its niche specificity. Human-associated taxa like Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus equorum were prevalent in high-contact areas, while exterior surfaces displayed distinct microbial signatures, including potential pathogens linked to environmental exposure. These findings reveal a complex and artifact-specific microbial landscape, emphasizing the need for tailored, bio-informed conservation strategies.

Cell migration is driven by the extension of actin-based lamellipodia protrusions, powered by actin polymerization, which is tightly regulated by signaling pathways, including Rho GTPases and Ca2+ signaling. While the importance of Ca2+ signaling in lamellipodia protrusions has been established, the molecular mechanisms linking Ca2+ to lamellipodia assembly are unknown. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+ signaling axis involving the mechano-gated channel TRPV4, which regulates lamellipodia protrusions in various cell types. Using Ca2+ and FRET imaging, we demonstrate that TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ influx upregulates RhoA activity within lamellipodia, which then facilitates formin-mediated actin assembly. Mechanistically, we identify CaMKII and TEM4 as key mediators relaying the TRPV4-mediated Ca2+ signal to RhoA. These data define a molecular pathway by which Ca2+ influx regulates small GTPase activity within a specific cellular domain - lamellipodia - and demonstrate the critical role in organizing the actin machinery and promoting cell migration in diverse biological contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

However, little effort has been dedicated to determining which specific system(s) within defense islands limit lytic phage reproduction in clinical bacterial strains. Here, we employed the CRISPR-based Cascade-Cas3 system to delete defense islands in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate to identify mechanisms of lytic phage antagonism. Deletion of one island in a cystic fibrosis-derived clinical isolate sensitized the strain to phages from the Pbunavirus family, which are commonly used as therapeutics. The causal defense system is a Type IIS restriction endonuclease-like protein (ENDPaCF1), common in Pseudomonads, however it lacks an associated methyltransferase typical Type IIS R-M systems. ENDPaCF1 protects bacteria against phages with hypermodified DNA and is surprisingly agnostic to the specific structure of the modification, which is unlike typical type IV restriction endonucleases. In ENDPaCF1, the endonuclease domain is fused to a catalytically inactive Endonuclease III (iEndoIII), a domain that recognizes non-canonical bases to repair DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. We therefore propose that nucleases containing an iEndoIII domain (END nucleases) can sense diverse DNA hypermodifications. Our findings reveal modularity of the sensing and cleavage domains, as expected of a modification-dependent endonucleases. We further show that some hypermodified phages, including Pbunavirus family members and Wrowclawvirus family (Pa5oct-like) of jumbo phages, encode END nuclease inhibitors that directly bind to the nuclease, likely via the iEndoIII domain. These inhibitors are necessary for Pbunavirus to plaque on clinical isolates and sufficient to enable other hypermodified phages to plaque in the presence of this defense system.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

However, many patients harbor antibodies and B cells directed against allogeneic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, notably HLA-A2, greatly decreasing their likelihood of receiving a compatible organ. Moreover, antibody-mediated rejection is a significant contributor to chronic transplant rejection. Current strategies to desensitize patients non-specifically target circulating antibodies and B cells, resulting in poor efficacy and complications. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are immune cells dedicated to suppressing specific immune responses by interacting with both innate and adaptive immune cells. Here, we genetically modified human Tregs with a chimeric anti-HLA antibody receptor (CHAR) consisting of an extracellular HLA-A2 protein fused to a CD28-CD3zeta intracellular signaling domain, driving Treg activation upon recognition of anti-HLA-A2 antibodies on the surface of alloreactive B cells. We find that HLA-A2 CHAR Tregs get activated specifically by anti-HLA-A2 antibody-producing cells. Of note, HLA-A2 CHAR activation does not negatively affect Treg stability, as measured by expression of the Treg lineage transcription factors FOXP3 and HELIOS. Interestingly, HLA-A2 CHAR Tregs are not cytotoxic towards anti-HLA-A2 antibody-producing cells, unlike HLA-A2 CHAR modified conventional CD4+ T cells. Importantly, HLA-A2 CHAR Tregs recognize and significantly suppress high affinity IgG antibody production by B cells from HLA-A2 sensitized patients.

Given this importance, the rational design of microbiomes with targeted functional properties is an important objective. Designing microbial consortia with targeted functions is challenging due to complex community interactions and environmental heterogeneity. Community-function landscapes address this challenge by statistically inferring impacts of species presence or absence on function. Similar to fitness landscapes, community-function landscapes are shaped by both additive effects and interactions (epistasis) among species that influence function. Here, we apply the community-function landscape approach to design synthetic microbial consortia to degrade the toxic environmental contaminant bisphenol-A (BPA). Using synthetic communities of BPA-degrading isolates, we map community-function landscapes across increasing BPA concentrations, where higher BPA means greater toxicity. As toxicity increases, so does epistasis, indicating that collective effects become more important in degradation. Further, we leverage landscapes to rationally design communities with predictable BPA degradation dynamics in vitro. Remarkably, designed synthetic communities are able to remediate BPA in contaminated soils. Our results demonstrate that toxicity can drive epistatic interactions in community-function landscapes and that these landscapes can guide microbial consortia design for bioremediation.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

However, the gut microbiome can interact with these parasites to influence infection outcomes, raising the possibility that its response to increasing temperatures may help buffer against increased infection burden. To evaluate this hypothesis, we sought to determine if the microbiome is resistant or resilient to the stressors of increased water temperature, helminth exposure, and their combination, and whether this variation linked to infection outcomes. We leveraged the zebrafish (Danio rerio) model organism to measure how these variables relate to the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiome. In particular, we exposed adult zebrafish to the parasitic whipworm Pseudocapillaria tomentosa across three different water temperatures (28{degrees}C, 32{degrees}C, 35{degrees}C), and analyzed fecal microbiome samples at five time points across 42 days. Our findings show that parasite exposure and water temperature independently alter gut microbiome diversity. Moreover, we find that water temperature moderates the association between parasite infection and the gut microbiome. Consistent with this observation, but at odds with current expectations, we find that increasing water temperature reduces parasitic infection in fish. Overall, our results indicate that water temperature alters the contextual landscape of the gut microbiome to impact its response to an exogenous stressor of an intestinal parasite in zebrafish. Furthermore, our findings represent the first report of the effects of elevated temperature on parasitic nematode development in a fish host. Importantly, our study demonstrates that climate change may have unanticipated and environmentally contingent impacts to vertebrate gut microbiomes and health outcomes in response to an exogenous stressor.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815

We show that an OLD family enzyme of Saccharolobus islandicus REY15A (SisOLD) is essential for cell viability and exhibits cyclic expression patterns at both transcriptional and translational levels, displaying the peak expression during the genome synthesis (S) cell cycle phase. SisOLD overexpression or knockdown leads to significant growth retardation, cell size enlargement, and increased cellular DNA content.

The etiology of PMDD, or more generally premenstrual syndrome (PMS) including subclinical forms, is not well understood and both biological and psychological models have been postulated. In the current manuscript we explore the role of emotion regulation ability for the emergence of premenstrual symptoms. Specifically, we were interested whether difficulties in emotion regulation in women with PMS/PMDD persisted as a trait across all cycle phases or were specific to the symptomatic premenstrual phase. We also explored for the first time, whether difficulties in emotion regulation already emerged during the high progesterone mid-luteal phase. 105 women aged 18 to 35 years completed a trait questionnaire on difficulties in emotion regulation, as well as two state measures of emotion regulation during three cycle phases (mid-follicular, mid-luteal, premenstrual). PMS/PMDD was prospectively confirmed across two menstrual cycles in 54 women, while the remaining 51 were assigned to the control group. Our results confirm previous findings that women with PMS/PMDD subjectively report more difficulties in emotion regulation on a trait scale. However, these difficulties were not confirmed in any of the state measures employed in the current study. Furthermore, difficulties in emotion regulation did not account for premenstrual symptom severity in a mediation analysis. This raises the question, whether difficulties in emotion regulation underly premenstrual symptoms or the perception of impaired emotion regulation arises as a consequence of untreated PMS/PMDD. Noteworthy, we were also able to demonstrate via Bayesian analyses, that mood worsening in the premenstrual phase is not a universal occurrence and absent in healthy controls. Taken together these findings highlight the importance of adequate diagnosis and treatment of PMDD.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

MethodsRetrospective spatial analysis. Distances between each inpatient facility and the nearest wildfire perimeter were computed on an annual basis using data from the California Department of Health Care Access and Information and CAL-FIREs Fire and Resource Assessment Program. Temporal changes were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis and linear models.

ResultsThe distance from inpatient healthcare facilities in California to nearby wildfires is decreasing by an average of 628 feet per year, while close approaches are increasing; during 2017-2023, there was 53% increase in the number of inpatient beds within five miles of a wildfire as compared with 2001-2008.

ConclusionWildfires are occurring closer to inpatient healthcare facilities in California. An increasing proportion of Californias inpatient bed capacity is exposed to nearby wildfires. Policies to reduce risk posed by wildfires, prepare for evacuations, preserve access to healthcare, and ensure safe location of new facilities are urgently needed to ensure the safety of patients and the wellbeing of populations that depend on inpatient healthcare services.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

The estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene encodes the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) which plays a critical role in mediating estrogen signaling and regulates various physiological and psychological processes. In this study, we investigated the relationship between six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in intron 4 of the ESR1 gene and premenstrual symptom severity, emphasizing symptom- genotype associations and SNP interactions. Results demonstrated that specific SNPs were linked to distinct symptom profiles, such as anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Interactions between SNPs revealed both risk-enhancing and protective effects. These findings suggest that premenstrual symptoms may stem from a genotype-linked reduced sensitivity to ovarian hormones, providing a foundation for future research.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

While cortically implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer high communication bandwidth to assist and rehabilitate these patients, their invasiveness and long-term stability limits broader adoption.

MethodsWe developed a minimally invasive BCI with 8 chronic epidural electrodes above primary sensorimotor cortex to restore hand functions of tetraplegia patients. With wireless powering and neural data transmission, this system enables real-time BCI control of hand movements and hand function rehabilitation in home use. A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) patient with paralyzed hand functions was recruited in this study.

ResultsOver a 9-month period of home use, the patient achieved an average grasping detection F1-score of 0.91, and a 100% success rate in object transfer tests, with this minimally invasive BCI and a wearable exoskeleton hand. This system allowed the patient to perform eating, drinking and other daily tasks involving hand functions. Additionally, the patient showed substantial neurological recovery through consecutive BCI training, regaining the ability to hold objects without BCI. The patient exhibited a 5-point improvement in upper limb motor scores and a 27-point increase in the action research arm test (ARAT). A maximal increase of 12.2 V was observed in the peak of somatosensory evoked potential, which points to a considerable recovery in impaired spinal cord connections.

ConclusionsIn a tetraplegia patient with complete spinal cord injury, an epidural minimally invasive BCI assisted the patients hand grasping to perform daily tasks, and 9-month consecutive BCI use significantly improved the hand functions.","NA","medrxiv",1743718151815

However, the causal relationship between [GABA] and learning has yet to be determined. Here, we conducted a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to investigate the effect of increased GABAergic inhibition via GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen on motor learning and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) metrics. Increasing GABA-mediated inhibition with baclofen did not change response times, but significantly impaired motor sequence learning. In parallel, we demonstrated a blunting of the expected decrease in [GABA] during motor learning. These results highlight a causal role for GABAergic inhibition in motor learning and may have clinical implications: baclofen is commonly used to treat post brain-injury spasticity, but may impair motor learning during rehabilitation.","NA","biorxiv",1743718151815
