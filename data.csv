Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

However, the role of astrocyte-mediated communication has been largely underappreciated. While astrocytes communicate with one another through gap junctions, the extent and specificity of this communication remain poorly understood. Astrocyte gap junctions are necessary for memory formation, synaptic plasticity, coordination of neuronal signaling, and closing the visual and motor critical periods. These findings indicate that this form of communication is essential for proper central nervous system development and function. Despite their significance, studying astrocyte gap junctional networks has been challenging. Current methods like slice electrophysiology disrupt network connectivity and introduce artifacts due to tissue damage. To overcome these limitations, we developed a vector-based approach that labels molecules as they are fluxed by astrocyte gap junctions in awake, behaving animals. We then used whole-brain tissue clearing to image these intact, three-dimensional astrocyte networks. We show that multiple astrocyte networks traverse the mouse brain. These networks selectively connect specific regions, rather than diffusing indiscriminately, and vary in size and organization. We observe local networks are confined to single brain regions and long-range networks robustly interconnecting multiple regions across hemispheres, often exhibiting patterns distinct from known neuronal networks. Further, we demonstrate that astrocyte networks undergo structural reorganization in adult brain following sensory deprivation. These discoveries reveal a previously unrecognized mode of communication between distant brain regions, mediated by plastic networks of gap junction-coupled astrocytes.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

In this study, we investigated several structure-informed approaches to annotate hypothetical proteins from Pseudomonas infecting phages. We curated a representative dataset of over 10,000 proteins derived from NCBI, for which we predicted protein structures with ColabFold and assessed structural similarity via FoldSeek against the PDB, AlphaFold, and Phold databases. We evaluated multiple annotation strategies, including sequence-based (Pharokka), and structure-based (FoldSeek, Phold) methods. Our results show that up to 43 % of truly unannotated proteins can be functionally annotated when combining structure-informed approaches with UniProt-derived annotations. We highlight the complementarity of different databases and the importance of annotation quality filtering.

However, functional studies of their development, evolution, and biology have been constrained by the lack of efficient and scalable genome editing tools. Here, we report a robust, high-efficiency, and transgene-free CRISPR-Cas12-based genome editing method applicable across four ecologically and biotechnologically important brown algal species. Using Ectocarpus as a model, we optimized a PEG-mediated RNP delivery system employing a temperature-tolerant Cas12 variant, achieving reproducible, high-efficiency editing across multiple loci without the need for cloning or specialized equipment. As proof of concept, we precisely recapitulated the hallmark imm mutant phenotype by editing the IMMEDIATE UPRIGHT (IMM) locus, a phenotype previously described only from a rare spontaneous mutation. APT/2-FA-based selection further improved specificity with minimal false positives. The protocol was readily transferrable to other species, including kelps long considered recalcitrant to transformation. This platform now makes functional genomics accessible in brown algae, enabling mechanistic dissection of developmental processes, life cycle transitions, and the independent origins of complex multicellularity. Our work enables the broader adoption of brown algae as experimental models and provides a valuable platform for marine biotechnology and evolutionary research.

MotivationAlthough most of biodiversity on Earth lives in oceans, a significant proportion of its organisms remain largely uncharacterized. Brown algae represent one of such understudied group of marine photosynthetic eukaryotes. Despite their importance as emerging models for developmental evolution and blue biotechnology, functional genomics in brown algae has remained largely inaccessible due to a lack of efficient and scalable genome editing tools. Our aim is to democratize genome editing in brown algae by developing a high-efficiency, transgene-free protocol that works across multiple species, without the need for specialized equipment. This high-efficiency method fully enables the field of functional genomics in an unexplored multicellular lineage.

However, GMoH reports have attracted both criticism (4-5) and support (6-8). Here, we present results from a large-scale household survey, the Gaza Mortality Survey (GMS), which provides independent estimates of war-related deaths between October 7, 2023 and January 5, 2025. Our findings suggest that violent mortality has significantly exceeded official figures. Our central estimate for the extent of GMoH undercount closely matches a separate estimate made using capture-recapture methods (7). We also find that nonviolent excess deaths, often overlooked in conflict assessments, also represent a substantial burden. These results underscore the feasibility of mortality surveillance methodologies in some highly challenging war-affected settings and provide a crucial empirical foundation for assessing the true human cost of the war.","NA","medrxiv",1753308667464

Such biases distort phylogenetic inference, particularly in deep or unevenly sampled phylogenomic datasets. While composition-aware models can mitigate this issue, their computational demands often preclude their use in large-scale analyses. We present WitChi, a computationally efficient tool for identifying and removing compositionally biased alignment columns using empirical significance testing. WitChi calculates taxon-specific chi-squared ({chi}{superscript 2}) scores and compares them to null distributions derived from column permutations that preserve the phylogenetic structure of the alignment. Sites most responsible for significant deviation are iteratively pruned using one of three scoring algorithms, continuing until no taxa remain significantly biased or until further pruning would reduce the overall alignment {chi}{superscript 2} score below the expected null range. Z-scores and p-values are provided for both taxa and alignments, offering interpretable metrics of bias severity. Pruning of simulated compositional heterogeneous alignments show that WitChi reliably restores correct topologies under standard, compositionally stationary models. In benchmarks, WitChi outperforms or matches BMGEs stationary-based trimming while scaling linearly with taxon number. Applied to the archaeal GTDB r220 dataset (5,869 taxa; 10,101 sites), WitChi completes pruning in under two hours on four CPU cores. The resulting phylogeny recovers key clades previously resolved only by in-depth analyses using complex models of sequence evolution. WitChi provides an efficient and scalable solution for detecting and removing compositional bias, enabling more accurate phylogenetic inference across the tree of life.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

These MLOs, termed biomolecular condensates, are commonly formed by the thermodynamic process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and assembly of large numbers of proteins, nucleic acids and co-solvent molecules. Within MLOs, certain biomolecule types are particularly causative of phase separation, and are termed ""scaffolds"" as they provide the major driving forces for self-assembly. Other molecules that are present in a condensate, but are less causative than the scaffold molecules are termed ""clients"". Much effort has recently decoded many of the molecular interactions underlying LLPS in search of predicting equilibrium concentrations and materials properties of condensates. In this work, we provide a simple computational approach to predict the partitioning of globular protein clients into condensates primarily composed of disordered protein scaffolds. Specifically, we use multiple methods to calculate hydration free energy of a series of globular proteins, and find that hydration free energy is relatively well-correlated with the partition coefficient of these proteins into condensates. We then provide a comparison of different hydration free energy predictors and discuss why some may provide a more accurate prediction of partitioning. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings of hydration free energy as a predictor by identifying other possible confounding factors such as specific interactions, charge matching, and differential solvation inside a condensate, which will aid in making more robust predictions in future studies trained on more diverse data sets.

Significance StatementUnderstanding the extent to which molecules can partition into biomolecular condensates is crucial for deciphering cellular organization and function. This study introduces a simple computational approach to predict the partitioning of globular proteins into condensates using hydration free energy as a key predictor, which can be calculated from static globular protein structures. By comparing different hydration free energy predictors, we also higlight the limitations of relying solely on this hydration free energy, emphasizing the need to consider other molecular factors. We finally analyze the shortcomings of the hydration free energy precitions, and discuss other factors that contribute to partitioning of clients into condensates, namely specific interactions and net charge of the scaffold molecules, and different properties of water in the condensate.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Two strategies have been developed to address this limitation: massive sampling and replacing the evoformer with the pairformer, which does not rely on co-evolution, as introduced in AlphaFold3.

ResultsIn this study we benchmark structure prediction methods on unseen antibody-antigen complexes reveals that: (i) increased sampling improves the chances of generating correct models in a roughly log-linear way, (ii) for all methods, a significant challenge is identifying the correct models among those generated, (iii) AlphaFold3 outperforms AlphaFold2, Boltz-1 and Chai-1, and (iv) AlphaFold3s performance declines significantly for complexes lacking structural similarities to the training set, indicating that it has primarily learnt to detect remote structural similarities rather than to learn the physics of interactions.

Central to this decline is a complex interplay between inflammation and stem cell function. How these two processes are linked and influence regenerative capacity remains unclear. Here, we undertake a comprehensive assessment of age-related changes in the mouse colon at single-cell resolution. A survey of immune and epithelial compartments revealed a hyperactivated inflammatory state in the colon of old mice characterized by the induction of an interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma}) response signature in immune cells. This does not result in increased inflammation under homeostasis, but triggers a disproportionate inflammatory response, disrupting regeneration after challenge with the enteropathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Colons of old mice exhibit higher production of IFN{gamma} by T and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are associated with reduced Lgr5+ stem cells and decreased epithelial proliferation. Interestingly, we find aged intestinal epithelial cells to be hypersensitive to IFN{gamma} signaling, inducing a regeneration-associated fetal-like gene expression signature that, in turn, renders these cells more sensitive to IFN{gamma}-induced apoptosis. Our findings reveal an age-related imbalance in the interaction between the immune and epithelial compartments in the colon, priming the system for excessive inflammatory responses and the emergence of a hypersensitive epithelial cell state thus derailing proper repair of the intestinal epithelium after injury.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

These interactions can support the persistence of resistant cells even in the absence of treatment, undermining standard aggressive therapies and motivating drug holiday-based approaches that leverage ecological dynamics. A key challenge in implementing such strategies is efficiently identifying interaction between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for characterizing these interactions. We investigate whether spatial patterns in single time-point images of cell populations can reveal the underlying game theoretic interactions between sensitive and resistant cells. To achieve this goal, we develop an agent-based model in which cell reproduction is governed by local game-theoretic interactions. We compute a suite of spatial statistics on single time-point images from the agent-based model under a range of games being played between cells. We quantify the informativeness of each spatial statistic and demonstrate that a simple machine learning model can classify the type of game being played. Our findings suggest that spatial structure contains sufficient information to infer ecological interactions. This work represents a step toward clinically viable tools for identifying cell-cell interactions in tumors, supporting the development of ecologically informed cancer therapies.

Author summaryDrug resistance is a major challenge in cancer treatment, often leading to relapse despite initially successful therapy. While mutations are a key driver, ecological interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells also play a critical role. These interactions are complex and dynamic, and few molecular biomarkers exist, making them difficult to study and account for in treatment planning. We use evolutionary game theory, a framework for quantifying interactions between cells, to investigate whether it is possible to infer these interactions using just a single time-point image of the cells. We develop an agent-based model where cells reproduce based on local interactions and quantify the resulting patterns in how cells are distributed across space using a suite of spatial statistics. We find that specific interaction types produce distinct spatial patterns that are evident in these metrics, and we train a simple machine learning model to classify the interaction type based on the metrics. Our results suggest that spatial data alone can offer valuable insights into tumor dynamics, potentially enabling more informed and adaptable cancer treatments based on eco-evolutionary principles.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Current methods struggle to capture this complexity at the single-molecule level. Here we introduce Iterative Mapping of Proteoforms (IMaP), a method that enables the massively-parallel interrogation of millions to billions of single-protein molecules through iterative probing with fluorescently labeled antibodies. Using 12 site-specific antibodies, the method is capable of measuring 212 (4,096) potential proteoform groups. We used IMaP to measure proteoform group profiles of the tau protein, a key player in neurodegenerative diseases, using two pan anti-tau antibodies (Tau-13, Tau-216), three isoform-specific antibodies (Anti-0N, Anti-2N, Anti-4R), and seven phosphosite-specific antibodies (Anti-pT181, Anti-pS202+pT205, Anti-pT205, Anti-pS214, Anti-pT217, Anti-pT231, and Anti-pS396). The method demonstrates high sensitivity (detecting proteoforms at 0.1% abundance), high reproducibility (median CV <5.5%), and broad dynamic range (>3 orders of magnitude), outperforming conventional techniques in resolving closely related proteoform groups. We demonstrated that the method can be used on relevant biological samples by examining various neuronal models (iNeuron cells, organoids, MiBrains, and mouse brains) and human samples. This examination revealed 130 distinct tau proteoform groups with as many as six phosphorylation events. The non-random distribution of these phosphorylation events suggests ordered and site-specific modification processes rather than random, stochastic accumulation. Certain combinations of phosphorylation events were more abundant than others; for example, pT217 preferentially co-occurred with pT181. In validating the applicability of the assay to human disease samples, we noted a specific pattern of multiple phosphorylation events in an advanced Alzheimers disease patient that suggests a sequential pathway of pathological tau modification. Iterative Mapping of Proteoforms provides insights into proteoform complexity at the single-molecule level, with significant implications for understanding protein regulation in neurodegenerative diseases and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1753308667464
"Modelling the impacts of imports of non-native honeybees into the native Apis mellifera mellifera populationin Ireland","10.1101/2025.07.16.664955","biorxiv",4.7,1.85,4.7,4.7,4.7,"de Carlos, I.; Strachan, L.; McCormack, G.

To study the impacts of this import, we built a SIMplyBee stochastic model of hybridisation between a native Apis mellifera mellifera population in Ireland and a non-native (C lineage) honey bee population. The model included colony honey yield and fitness as complex polygenic traits. We modelled the effects of varying the percentage of imports, the genetic correlations between fitness in native and non-native environment, and the spatial distribution of introgression over 20 years. We measured the levels and rate of introgression and the changes in genetic means for honey yield and fitness. The results revealed that increased imports expectedly increase the rate of introgression. This introgression induced a trade-off between increased honey yield and decreased fitness. Changing the genetic correlation between fitness in native and non-native environment pointed to a larger fitness decrease with negative correlations. The study showed the spread of introgression across the whole simulated area, indicating that even colonies far from the import zones could be affected over time. Furthermore, halting imports generated a desirable direction of change, however the purging of introgressed material was very slow and varied substantially across replicates. These results underscore the risks and long-term impacts of import on complex polygenic traits. We argue that the best way forward to manage the problem of import and associated introgression is to invest in holistic selective breeding of the native honey bee population in its native environment rather than import invasive subspecies that are bred to be successful in a different climate. The study also highlights the lack of fundamental quantitative genetic parameters for complex polygenic traits of different honey bee populations in different environments.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

The strong binding of this RNA fraction to insoluble chromatin impairs its recovery in standard transcriptomic studies. Therefore, the landscape and potential functions of chromatin-associated RNAs are poorly understood. Recent studies indicate that chromatin-associated transcripts can have regulatory roles, particularly during mammalian development. Here we compare the dynamics of cytoplasmic versus chromatin-bound transcriptomes of naive and primed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), as well as fibroblasts. We found a remarkable enrichment for RNA transcribed from alpha satellite repeat (ALR) in the chromatin fraction of naive hESCs, compared to primed hESCs. The co-localization and interaction of ALR RNA with Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) protein indicate that ALR RNA foci mark the perinucleolar compartment (PNC), a nuclear sub-compartment previously thought to be exclusive to cancer cells. Knockdown of ALR RNA leads to dispersion of PTBP1 foci, up-regulation of ribosomal RNA and global hypertranscription in naive hESCs. In contrast, loss of PTBP1 does not disturb ALR RNA localization, indicating that ALR is upstream in the hierarchy of organization of the PNC in hESCs. These results reveal a role for ALR RNA in nuclear compartmentalization and tuning rRNA synthesis in naive hESCs. Moreover, this study opens new avenues to dissect the function of ALR RNA and the PNC in cancer contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

We have found that in fission yeast, the absence of exomer leads to a defect in the recovery of ""target of rapamycin complex 2"" (TORC2) activity in response to high concentrations of KCl, but not to sorbitol, which indicates that the mutants are impaired in their ability to respond to salt stress. Changes in lipid homeostasis did not suppress this defect. Ryh1RAB6 is a Rab GTPase that resides in the Golgi and endosomes and facilitates or stabilizes the interaction between TORC2 and its substrate, the AGC kinase Gad8. We have found genetic and functional interactions between exomer and Ryh1RAB6. The recovery of TORC2 activity in response to KCl requires Ryh1RAB6 and exomer, and the localization of Ryh1RAB6 is aberrant in exomer mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the interaction between TORC2 and Gad8 is weaker in the absence of exomer. We propose that exomer regulates TORC2 by facilitating appropriate Ryh1 localization.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

While well-studied in the silkworm (Bombyx mori), little is known about the gene expression profiles underlying the diversity of lepidopteran silks. Here we characterized the silk gland from the pantry moth Plodia interpunctella using a combination of quantitative and spatial assays. RNA-seq analyses of differential gene expression between the MSG and PSG depict the transcriptomic divergence between these two secretory tissues. In the PSG, high expression of fibroin genes FibL and FibH were detected, whereas MSG samples were dominated by transcripts encoding major sericins-- bioadhesive proteins that form the coating of the silk fiber. Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) mRNA profiling revealed sharp cellular boundaries within the silk gland: PSG cells exclusively expressed fibroins, while MSG comprised two compartments each expressing different combinations of sericins. Our findings corroborate the conserved organization of lepidopteran silk glands into specialized secretory subdivisions, and establish Plodia as a promising comparative model for studying silk diversity. This work provides a foundation for future research into the cellular and evolutionary basis of silk production across Lepidoptera.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

In particular among those patients with homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors (>50%), most eventually succumb to their disease due to high recurrence rates, acquired resistance, and cumulative toxicity. This report summarizes work from the 12th IMO Workshop in which we explored an alternative ""extinction therapy"" strategy for frontline treatment of HGSOC. Inspired by ecological principles, this multi-strike approach aims to eradicate tumors not through a singular ""magic bullet"" but through a series of therapies after standard frontline treatment when the tumor is still, and perhaps most, vulnerable. We present a framework leveraging mathematical modeling (MM) to develop personalized multi-strike protocols for HGSOC. Key contributions include: 1) An ""IMOme"" score using liquid biopsy data to assess patient-specific hematopoietic toxicity risk, guiding the timing and selection of subsequent therapies, 2) MM strategies to design effective lowdose combinations of targeted agents to achieve synthetic lethality while managing toxicity, and 3) A MM framework to analyze the interplay between chemotherapy, gut microbiome toxicity, and immunotherapy, demonstrating how mitigating microbiome damage could enhance immune response. Overall, the computational approaches presented herein aim to support the design of personalized, multi-strike regimens in the frontline setting that proactively target tumor extinction while managing toxicity, ultimately seeking to deliver cures for patients with HGSOC.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

But what other records can attest to the deep history of enzymes, and what tools are needed to decode their meaning? Here, we demonstrate that the history of enzyme discovery and reuse is embedded within the web of interdependencies that constitute contemporary, biosphere-scale metabolism. Using a simple network analysis approach, we reconstruct both the relative temporal ordering of enzyme domain emergence and, where possible, the first reactions that they catalyzed. These network-based histories were found to be broadly concordant with phyletic information, suggesting that the two approaches reflect related generative processes. When enzyme emergence is initiated after the discovery of nucleotide cofactors, a predominantly stepwise trajectory of domain discovery is recovered. We find that the earliest enzyme-mediated metabolisms were dominated by /{beta} domains, likely due to their high discoverability and functional potential under constraint. Finally, we quantify how the protein universe responded to a major transition, the biological production of molecular oxygen, by preferentially reusing pre-existing enzyme domains. This work presents a self-consistent model of metabolic and enzyme evolution, essential progress towards integrating multiple, independent records into a unified history of protein evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Using matched bilateral presentation paradigms and fMRI-based decoding, we systematically compared spatial representations during perception and VWM. This approach revealed a striking dissociation: during perception, object information is largely confined to the contralateral LOC, whereas during VWM, robust ipsilateral representations emerge--even when both hemifields must be remembered. Vertex-ablation analyses revealed that VWM engages 70-90% of ipsilateral LOC territories, far exceeding those recruited during unilateral perception. Neither increased attentional span nor top-down feedback from association areas fully explained this expansion; rather, ipsilateral LOC patterns closely mirrored contralateral sensory representations, implicating interhemispheric coordination in VWM. Together, these findings demonstrate that object VWM flexibly recruits distributed high-level visual cortex, with spatial reorganization distinguishing mnemonic flexibility from perceptual fidelity.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

In 7 frequency bands ({delta}: 0.5-4 Hz,{theta} : 4-8 Hz, : 8-12 Hz, {beta}: 12-28 Hz,{gamma} 1: 28-46 Hz,{gamma} 2: 55-70 Hz, and HF: 64-116 Hz) we quantified the signal consistency (1) within individuals, (2) across subjects, and (3) across modalities. OPM exhibited widespread reliability, particularly in lower frequency bands; spatial patterns resembled those of fMRI and iEEG in visual and auditory regions. Cross-modal analyses revealed robust OPM-fMRI correspondence, including inverse correlations at low frequencies and positive correlations at higher frequencies, consistent with known relationships between oscillatory power and BOLD responses. Comparisons of signal-to-noise (SNR) estimates further revealed that in some regions, the SNR of cross-modal alignment exceeded within-modality reliability, suggesting that bridging between modalities can sometimes enhance SNR by attenuating reliably shared noise. Our findings demonstrate that OPM consistently captures stimulus-locked neural dynamics that converge with established modalities.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

While studying blood phenotype-associated variation within the HOXA locus, we identified a genetic variant, rs17437411, associated with globally reduced blood counts, protection from blood cancers, and variation in anthropometric phenotypes. We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Mechanistically, HOTSCRAMBL enables appropriate expression and splicing of HOXA genes in HSCs, most notably HOXA9, in an SRSF2-dependent manner. Given the critical role of HOXA gene expression in some blood cancers, we also demonstrate that HOTSCRAMBL variation or deletion compromises HOXA-dependent acute myeloid leukemias. Collectively, we show how insights from human genetic variation can uncover critical regulatory processes required for effective developmental gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

The presence of Tau/TDP-43 co-pathology is associated with increased disease severity, although the causal relationship remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that Tau and TDP-43 mutually promote each others condensation through direct interaction in vitro, forming irregularly shaped or multiphasic co-condensates with lower TDP-43 mobility, but higher Tau dynamics. While Tau promotes TDP-43 aggregation in vitro, TDP-43 suppresses formation of Tau fibrils and instead causes formation of oligomeric Tau and Tau/TDP-43 species. These co-assemblies hinder Tau seeding in a biosensor assay specific for proteopathic Tau seeds. Consistent with this data, SarkoSpin extracts from AD brains with Tau/TDP-43 co-pathology exhibit reduced Tau seeding compared to Tau-only AD brains. In contrast, patient-derived extracts from AD brains with Tau/TDP-43 co-pathology are highly potent in seeding TDP-43 neoaggregates in a TDP-43 reporter cell line. Our results suggest that direct interaction of TDP-43 and Tau may suppress Tau pathology, while promoting TDP-43 pathology.

We present lessons learned from a comprehensive large-scale biobanking effort combining traditional sample collection with several in vitro models including 3-dimensional patient-derived organoids (PDOs), 2-dimensional cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and/or in vivo xenografts. This initiative started in 2018, integrating multiple advanced ex-vivo models such as PDOs, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids (PDXOs). This unique resource now includes tumor avatars from over 380 consented patients, making it the largest living GEA biobank in the world. We achieved > 90% success rate in creating per-patient models, including 227 tumor-derived and 203 neighboring normal PDOs. These organoids accurately mirror key features of the original tumors, such as their histology (e.g. microsatellite instability), mutations, and drug response, across treatment points. Notably, PDOs can predict individual patient responses to chemotherapy within five weeks, underscoring their clinical relevance. Furthermore, high-throughput drug screening on PDO subsets generates personalized chemosensitivity profiles for 22 drugs. Through a process of continued refinement of culture techniques and tumor sampling approach, our large-scale comprehensive collection of GEA avatars represents a unique and valuable preclinical experimental resource for precision oncology.

In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) content negatively associates with insulin sensitivity, while endurance athletes exhibit IMCL levels were positively correlated to insulin sensitivity, which is known as the athletes paradox. To solve this paradox, LDs were isolated from skeletal muscle samples of seven athletes and nine T2DM patients, and the first proteome dataset of human skeletal muscle LD was established. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed 733 upregulated proteins in athlete LDs, primarily enriched in mitochondria, and 755 downregulated proteins, mainly associated with cytoskeletal components, relative to T2DM patients. Integrated analysis with tissue proteomics further indicated enhanced energy metabolism activity of LD-anchored mitochondria (LDAM) in athletes. Notably, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was specifically upregulated by 2.97-fold on LDs in athletes, while its overall tissue expression remained unchanged. Moreover, deletion of ATGL in myoblasts significantly reduced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation. Additionally, skeletal muscle LDs from db/db and ob/ob mice exhibited reduced levels of mitochondrial proteins and ATGL. Together, our findings reveal a LD-based solution for the athletes paradox, and identify ATGL as a key regulator of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. The results also suggest that the ""bad LDs"" in the skeletal muscle of T2DM patients are characterized by higher levels of cytoskeletal proteins, reduced LDAM, and lower ATGL compared to the ""good LDs"" observed in athletes.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Upon activation, they oligomerize into inflammasome-like resistosomes to initiate immune signaling, yet the dynamics of resistosome assembly remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the virulence effector AVRcap1b from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans suppresses immune activation by directly engaging oligomerization intermediates of the tomato helper NLR SlNRC3. Cryo-EM structures of SlNRC3 in AVRcap1b-bound and unbound states reveal that AVRcap1b bridges multiple protomers, stabilizing a stalled intermediate and preventing formation of a functional resistosome. Leveraging AVRcap1b as a molecular tool, we also capture an additional SlNRC3 resistosome intermediate showing that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner from dissociated monomers.

MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1753308667464

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Author SummaryGenomic surveillance has been used to monitor the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic. When a new variant emerges, it is often due to the accumulation of mutations during a persistent infection, i.e. in an individual who was unable to clear the virus after an infection. Using genomic and epidemiologic surveillance data, we identify 69 of these persistent infections in California and provide demographic and clinical characteristics of these infections compared to the broader population of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of risk factors for persistent infections provides important insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, while the identification of shared mutations between these infections enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may result in new variants. Ultimately, our work may help public health labs to better monitor persistent infections in the future, prior to the potential emergence and spread of novel variants into the community.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

What do we mean by the polygenicity of a trait? We propose a principled definition that encompasses a range of polygenicity measures. We show that these measures satisfy certain mathematical properties, we argue that these properties are sensible if not necessary, and we show that, conversely, measures that satisfy these properties also satisfy our definition. We consider four specific measures in greater detail, describe how they differ and show that three of them can be estimated from GWAS summary statistics using an existing method, Fourier Mixture Regression. We estimate these measures for 36 traits in humans. We find a dearth of traits with polygenicity values that fall within the large gap between Mendelian and highly polygenic traits. We discuss the evolutionary and cellular processes underlying trait polygenicity.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Globally, these viruses have caused mass mortalities in captive and wild avian and mammalian populations, including terrestrial and marine mammals. H5N1 has been the dominant subtype, and whilst incursions have overlapped temporally, occurrences have often been spatially distinct. Here, we report the detection of a mortality event in wild birds on the Norfolk coastline in the east of England, where H5N1 HPAIV was detected in five Great Black-backed Gulls (Larus marinus) and a Northern Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis). Interestingly, at the same site, and as part of the same mortality event, a total of 17 Great Black-backed Gulls, one Herring Gull (Larus argentatus), one Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica) and one Northern Fulmar tested positive for H5N5 HPAIV. Additionally, H5N5 was also detected in 17 co-located Grey Seal carcases (Halichoerus grypus). The H5N1 HPAIV from an infected bird belonged to genotype DI.2, closely related to contemporaneous detections in GB wild birds and poultry. In contrast, all H5N5 HPAIVs from birds and seals were genotype I with a 22-amino acid stalk deletion in NA and the 627K polymorphism in PB2. This represents the first recorded instance in GB of two subtypes being detected within the same avian population at the same location. It is also the first mass detection of HPAIV H5N5 in mammals within GB. Potential infection mechanisms are discussed.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

Understanding whether gender disparities exist in retraction rates, especially among top-performing scientists, may inform broader efforts to promote equity and research integrity.

ObjectiveTo assess gender disparities in the likelihood of having retracted publications among highly cited and all other authors, and to explore how these vary across scientific fields, countries, and publication age cohorts.

DesignCross-sectional bibliometric analysis incorporating retraction data into Scopus-based databases of top-cited scientists (top 2%) and all authors with [&ge;]5 publications. Retraction data were obtained from Retraction Watch and linked with author-level citation metrics.

SettingGlobal, science-wide analysis using data from authors in all disciplines indexed in Scopus.

ParticipantsA total of 10,361,367 authors with [&ge;]5 publications were included; 217,097 were among the top 2% most-cited authors. Gender was confidently assigned using NamSor for 8,267,888 authors. Authors with uncertain gender were excluded from gender-specific analyses.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresGender-specific retraction rates and the relative propensity (R) of women vs men to have at least one retraction, overall and stratified by citation status, field, country income level, publication age cohort and publication volumes.

ResultsAmong highly cited authors, retraction rates were 3.3% in men and 2.9% in women; among all authors, rates were 0.7% for both genders. Differences varied by field: womens rates were at least one-third lower than mens (R < 0.67) in Biology, Biomedical Research, and Psychology (R{square}< {square}0.67), but higher (R{square}> {square}1.33) in Economics, Engineering, and Information and Communication Technologies. Among highly cited authors, younger cohorts showed increasingly higher rates among men (4.2% men vs. 3.0% women in those starting to publish in 2002-2011; 8.7% men vs. 4.9% women in those starting post-2011). Country-level differences among highly cited authors were pronounced in some countries, as in Pakistan (28.7% men vs. 14.3% women). Among all authors, country-level gender differences were small.

Conclusions and RelevanceGender differences in retraction rates exist but are modest. Field, country, and publication volume are stronger correlates. Structural and contextual factors likely drive retraction patterns and warrant further investigation.

FindingsIn this cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of over 10 million authors with at least 5 publications, including 217,097 top-cited scientists, retraction rates were slightly lower in women than in men. Gender differences were modest compared with disparities by country, field, and citation volume, but varied across disciplines and publication age cohorts.

When we analysed the genome sequences of two clinical E. faecium strains isolated in Birmingham, UK, we found two pRUM-like plasmids, pHHEf1 and pHHEf2. They were approximately 25 kb in size and shared the same 10 kb backbone, but contained starkly different accessory regions that were bounded by and interspersed with the IS26 family insertion sequence IS1216. pHHEf1 contained a complete set of vancomycin resistance genes, while pHHEf2 contained aminoglycoside and erythromycin resistance genes along with an integrated small plasmid, pCOLA. It appeared that IS1216 had driven the diversification of these accessory regions. We sought to characterise the role of IS1216 in the broader evolution of pRUM-like plasmids by performing comparative analyses on 152 complete plasmid sequences from five continents. Extensive IS1216-mediated variation included backbone deletions, acquisition and loss of 10 different antibiotic resistance genes, and the formation of cointegrates with plasmids of at least 10 different replicon types. Cointegration events have introduced accessory segments with diverse functions, including horizontal transfer determinants and genes for bacteriocin T8. The derivations of these acquired segments highlight the impact of IS1216 in driving gene exchange between Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species. We traced the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage to a putative ancestor found in a vancomycin-sensitive ST17 E. faecium isolated in 1997. The ancestral plasmid, pCANE, includes the entire pRUM backbone with an additional 44.9 kb in place of the pRUM accessory region. The 44.9 kb segment includes putative conjugation determinants, suggesting that the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage coincided with a loss of transfer functions. We propose an IS1216 driven model for the evolution of pRUM-like plasmids, which appear to have arisen in E. faecium ST17 and contributed to the international success of CC17 as an opportunistic pathogen.

Impact StatementExperimental work has shown that the insertion sequence IS1216, found in Enterococcus, shares the cointegrate formation properties of the well-characterised IS26 of Gram-negative bacteria, which is a major contributor to the movement and accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes in important human pathogens. It seems likely that IS1216 plays a similar role in the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance in Enterococcus. However, the actions of IS1216 in the genus have not been the subject of focused comparative studies. Here, we provide genomic evidence for the crucial role of IS1216 in the evolution of the pRUM-like multidrug resistance plasmid lineage that has been found in E. faecium isolated globally. We have traced the evolution of the pRUM-like lineage to a cryptic ancestral plasmid found in a vancomycin-sensitive human clinical strain isolated in the 1990s.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

With this new implementation, Martini 3 allows more bead types and sizes, becoming more amenable to study dynamical phenomena involving small molecules such as protein-ligand interactions and membrane permeation. However, while there were some solutions to automatically model small molecules using the previous iteration of Martini force field, there is no simple way to generate such molecules for Martini 3 yet. Here, we introduce Auto-MartiniM3, an advanced and updated version of the Auto-Martini program, designed to automate the coarse-graining of small molecules to be used with the Martini 3 force field. We validated our approach by modeling 81 small molecules from the Martini Database and comparing their structural and thermodynamic properties with ones obtained from models designed by Martini experts. Additionally, we assessed the behavior of Auto-MartiniM3-generated models by calculating solute translocation and free energy across lipid bilayers. We also evaluated more complex molecules such as caffeine by testing its binding to the adenosine A2A receptor. Finally, our results from deploying Auto-MartiniM3 on a large dataset of molecular fragments demonstrate that this program can become a tool of choice for fast high-throughput creation of coarse-grained models of small molecules, offering a good balance between automation and accuracy.

Modest titers of bovine A/H5N1 HA-binding antibodies and low to undetectable neutralizing antibody responses were detected in a cohort of 73 individuals. Conversely, bovine A/H5N1 NA binding and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody responses were comparable to those against a human A/H1N1 NA at baseline. Seasonal influenza vaccination failed to significantly increase antibody titers against both HA and NA glycoproteins of bovine A/H5N1.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

Here we develop large-scale comparative cell biology and biochemical approaches to analyze 16 nuclease-NTPase systems and define shared features that control anti-phage defense. Purification, biochemical characterization, and in vitro reconstitution of nucleic acid targeting for each system demonstrate protein-protein complex formation is a universal feature of nuclease-NTPase systems and explain patterns of phage targeting and susceptibility. We show that some nuclease-NTPase systems use highly degenerate recognition site preferences to enable exceptionally broad nucleic acid degradation. Our results uncover shared principles of anti-phage defense system function and provide a foundation to explain the widespread role of nuclease-NTPase systems in bacterial immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

In principle, tailored biocatalysts able to cleave C--F bonds represent an attractive strategy to combat this (emerging) environmental crisis. However, Nature is largely impartial to C--F bonds, with fluoroacetate dehalogenases (FAcDs) standing out as a notable exception, catalyzing the hydrolysis of single C--F bonds in fluoroacetate at high turnover rates. To expand the substrate scope of FAcDs and harness its catalytic prowess for non-natural organofluorides, we designed and applied a robust growth-based selection strategy for large-scale FAcD engineering. Specifically, we demonstrate that FAcD-catalyzed C--F bond cleavage of (natural and) synthetic organofluorides generates metabolizable carbon sources for bacteria, enabling in vivo enrichment of active FAcD variants. By forcing populations expressing diverse FAcD-libraries to utilize various organofluorides as sole carbon source, we elicited a broad panel of FAcD variants that displayed improved activities and drastically altered substrate profiles. In these efforts, we also identified a previously overlooked inhibition pathway, which largely impedes the conversion of gem-difluoride compounds. Overall, our study presents the first large-scale engineering campaign of FAcDs and introduces an operationally simple selection platform that paves the way toward adapting these enzymes for the sustainable degradation of contaminating organofluorides.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

These communities are tremendously diverse, making it challenging to assign relevant functions to individual species. Fungal communities may be differentiated at the level of functional guilds; beyond such broad classification we have little delimitation, especially in fungal taxa common in grassland and agricultural soils. To resolve the level of functional similarity in fungal communities and define traits predictive of soil carbon cycling, we characterized fungal isolates abundant in agricultural soils to test the hypotheses that (i) the majority of saprobic soil fungi have the ability to use complex carbon sources, (ii) differences in complex carbon use abilities correlate with fungal enzymatic profiles, following principles of the fungal economics spectrum and (iii) carbon use ability is a predictive trait for fungal community functions. Using specialized growth media, we isolated and characterized 105 isolates and developed a novel FungiResp approach that directly tests fungal activity on complex carbon sources. The largest amount of variance between isolates was explained by differential abilities to use cellulose and starch, with only few phylogenetically distinct fungal clades showing high respiratory activity on these biopolymers. A preference for bacterial necromass was another major distinction among taxa. These key traits correlated with soil fungal community shifts in response to carbon substrate availability. By contrast, enzymatic activity was a poor predictor of fungal carbon use ability, except for correlations in lignin use and laccase activity. The newly established functional trait of carbon use ability offers important insights into diverse fungal communities: Many taxa lack the ability to use complex carbon (on their own), while the most common enzymes analyzed in soil showed little correlation with fungal mineralization potential. The discovery of key functional traits is an important step towards predicting the significance of fungal community shifts for soil carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

It offers two workflows: a fast-track pipeline requiring no image analysis expertise and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered pipeline with recent algorithms for image pre-processing, segmentation, and spatial analysis. We demonstrate openDVPs versatility in three archival tissue studies, profiling human placenta, early-stage lung cancer, and locally relapsed breast cancer.

This is in stark contrast to the largely unexplored situation in the human gut, where the underlying mechanisms and stimuli that induce regeneration are poorly understood.

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Here, we developed nxReLo, a simple and fast cell culture-based colocalization assay, designed to identify and characterize interactions between nuclear proteins. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) safeguard germline genome integrity, and the PPIs that facilitate piRNA production are therefore essential for animal reproduction, yet remain incompletely understood. We used nxReLo to investigate interactions between members of the Drosophila melanogaster Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex and two associated components, Bootlegger and Moonshiner, a nuclear protein network required for piRNA expression. We demonstrate the utility of the nxReLo assay by systematically screening pairwise interactions within the RDC network and by assembling a multiprotein complex from multiple components. By combining nxReLo assays with AlphaFold structural prediction, we characterized the Cutoff-Deadlock and the Bootlegger-Deadlock complexes in detail, providing molecular and structural insights. Specifically, we refined the domains involved in the interaction and identified interface point mutations that interfered with complex formation, validating the predicted structures.

Membrane fission is thus required to balance lysosome size, number, and composition. PIKfyve is a lipid kinase that converts phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] to phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] and promotes lysosome fission since lysosomes coalesce into larger, but fewer organelles in PIKfyve defective cells. Here, we reveal a role for PIKfyve in regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. We show the ER is less reticulated and motile in cells acutely inhibited for PIKfyve. Partly, this arises because lysosomes cluster perinuclearly and are less motile, which appears to arrest ER hitchhiking, a process in which lysosomes pull and form ER tubules via microtubule-based movement. Secondly, the ER morphology is distorted because of hyper-tethering of protrudin, an ER transmembrane protein, to lysosomes via excess PtdIns(3)P and protrudins FYVE domain. Thus, our findings reveal that PIKfyve activity balances phosphoinositides at ER-lysosome contact sites to govern ER properties and has significant implications to our understanding of disease linked to PIKfyve dysfunction such as neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters.

Drawing on our longitudinal data, these findings inform practical guidelines for minimizing variability through strategic experimental design and power analysis, providing a foundation for more robust and reproducible use of N. benthamiana in quantitative plant biology and synthetic biology applications.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

BindCraft leverages the weights of AlphaFold21 to generate binders with nanomolar affinity without the need for high-throughput screening or experimental optimization, even in the absence of known binding sites. We successfully designed binders against a diverse set of challenging targets, including cell-surface receptors, common allergens, de novo designed proteins, and multi-domain nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas9. We showcase the functional and therapeutic potential of designed binders by reducing IgE binding to birch allergen in patient-derived samples, modulating Cas9 gene editing activity, and reducing the cytotoxicity of a foodborne bacterial enterotoxin. Lastly, we utilize cell surface receptor-specific binders to redirect AAV capsids for targeted gene delivery.

As part of a broader long-term study on African leopard (Panthera pardus) population ecology in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda, we deployed camera traps on animal trails and at Python Cave, a known roost site of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and a confirmed Marburg and virus reservoir. This serendipitous deployment yielded the first visual documentation of a multi-trophic predator and scavenger guild interacting at a filovirus reservoir site. Over a five month period (February 16th - June 5th 2025) across 304 trap nights, we recorded at least 14 different vertebrate species, including leopards, primates, raptors, and small carnivores, engaging in bat predation, scavenging on bat remains, guano foraging, or cave exploration across 261 temporally and spatially independent events (>1 hour apart). These instances were structured, repeated and the species continuously made contact with the bats or entered their roosting space. Camera traps also recorded an estimated 400 human individuals visiting the cave -- including school groups, tourists, and local trainees -- the majority with no personal protective equipment. The shallow, accessible structure of Python Cave appears to collapse the typical spatial buffers between reservoir species and both predators and humans. These observations constitute the first ecological confirmation of a dynamic, multispecies exposure network at a known Marburg virus site, and may represent a Rosetta Stone for interpreting the real-time mechanics of zoonotic spillover.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

While these have the potential to significantly accelerate scientific discoveries by creating AI-driven virtual cell models, their progress has been greatly limited by the lack of large-scale high-quality perturbation data, which remains constrained due to scalability bottlenecks and assay variability. Here, we introduce ""Fix-Cryopreserve-ScRNAseq"" (FiCS) Perturb-seq, an industrialized platform for scalable Perturb-seq data generation. We demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq exhibits high sensitivity and low batch effects, effectively capturing perturbation-induced transcriptomic changes and recapitulating known biological pathways and protein complexes. In addition, we release X-Atlas: Orion edition (X-Atlas/Orion), the largest publicly available Perturb-seq atlas. This atlas, generated from two genome-wide FiCS Perturb-seq experiments targeting all human protein-coding genes, comprises eight million cells deeply sequenced to over 16,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell. Furthermore, we show that single guide RNA (sgRNA) abundance can serve as a proxy for gene knockdown (KD) efficacy. Leveraging the deep sequencing and substantial cell numbers per perturbation, we also show that stratification by sgRNA expression can reveal dose-dependent genetic effects. Taken together, we demonstrate that FiCS Perturb-seq is an efficient and scalable platform for high-throughput Perturb-seq screens. Through the release of X-Atlas/Orion, we highlight the potential of FiCS Perturb-seq to address current scalability and variability challenges in data generation, advance foundation model development that incorporates gene-dosage effects, and accelerate biological discoveries.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Using data-driven decomposition of fMRI responses in face-, body-, and scene-selective areas, we identified overlapping activity patterns shared across individuals. Each area encoded multiple interpretable dimensions tuned to both finer subcategory features and coarser cross-category distinctions beyond its preferred category, even in the most category-selective voxels. These dimensions formed distinct clusters within category-selective areas but were also sparsely distributed across the broader visual cortex, supporting both locally selective, category-specific, and globally distributed, feature-based coding.

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

Here, we present the first population-specific brain charts for China, developed through the Chinese Lifespan Brain Mapping Consortium (Phase I) using neuroimaging data from 43,037 participants (aged 0-100 years) across 384 sites nationwide. We establish the lifespan normative trajectories for 296 structural brain phenotypes, encompassing global, subcortical, and cortical measures. Cross-population comparisons with Western brain charts (based on data from 56,339 participants aged 0-100 years) reveal distinct neurodevelopmental patterns in the Chinese population, including prolonged cortical and subcortical maturation, accelerated cerebellar growth, and earlier development of sensorimotor regions relative to paralimbic regions. Crucially, these Chinese-specific charts outperform Western-derived models in predicting healthy brain phenotypes and detecting pathological deviations in Chinese clinical cohorts. These findings highlight the urgent need for diverse, population-representative brain charts to advance equitable precision neuroscience and improve clinical validity across populations.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data of male and female human, marmoset (New World monkey), and mouse gonadal cells spanning key prenatal stages. We find that the two primates and mouse share similar X chromosome expression dynamics, including X chromosome reactivation (XCR), and that in Klinefelter syndrome (XXY) testes, germ cells undergo female-like XCR and escape of X inactivation. New male-specific regulatory regions have emerged progressively during mammalian evolution, especially on the X following sex chromosome origination. Further analyses revealed that male-specific regulatory regions evolved faster than female-specific ones in both supporting and pre-meiotic germ cells. However, female meiotic germ cells show even higher rates of molecular evolution and exhibit a permissive chromatin state that facilitates the birth of new genes, thus resembling their adult spermatogenic counterparts. Finally, we traced both conserved and species-specific gene expression trajectories across the three mammals, uncovering candidate genes for disorders of sex development that are typically central to cell-type-specific regulatory networks. Together, our study unveils both ancestral mammalian and recently evolved gene regulatory programs that control human- and primate-specific aspects of gonadal development in both sexes.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Extensive research efforts have aimed to elucidate the human protein interactome, and comprehensive databases now catalog these interactions at scale. However, structural coverage of the human protein interactome is limited and remains challenging to resolve through experimental methodology alone. Recent advances in artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based approaches for protein interaction structure prediction present opportunities for large-scale structural characterization of the human interactome. One such model, Boltz-2, which is capable of predicting the structures of protein complexes, may serve this objective. Here, we present de novo computed models of 1,394 binary human protein interaction structures predicted using Boltz-2. These structural predictions were based on biochemically determined interaction data sourced from the IntAct database, together with corresponding protein sequences obtained from UniProt. We then assessed the predicted interaction structures through various confidence metrics, which consider both overall structure and the interaction interface. These analyses indicated that prediction confidence tended to be greater for smaller complexes, while increased multiple sequence alignment (MSA) depth tended to improve prediction confidence. Additionally, we performed a limited evaluation against experimentally determined human protein complex structures not included in the Boltz-2 training regimen, which indicated prediction accuracy consistent with AlphaFold3. This work demonstrates the utility of Boltz-2 for in silico structural modeling of the human protein interactome, while highlighting both strengths and limitations. Ultimately, such modeling is expected to yield broad structural insights with relevance across multiple domains of biomedical research.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Correspondingly, current theories describe muscle activity as a function of cortical dynamics. Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating. Together, these results reveal a regime in which motor cortex does not fully specify muscle activity, but must sculpt an ongoing, spinally-generated program to flexibly control behavior in a complex and changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Participants in an fMRI study viewed either the original film (with repeated musical themes) or a no-music version. By comparing neural activity patterns between these groups, we found that music-evoked reactivation of neural patterns linked to earlier scenes in the default mode network was associated with improved subsequent recall. This relationship was specific to the music condition and persisted when we controlled for a proxy measure of initial encoding strength (spatial intersubject correlation), suggesting that music-evoked reactivation may play a role in making event memories stick that is distinct from what happens at initial encoding.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Here we present the first direct evidence that H3K4me3 is not a cause but a consequence of transcriptional activation, functioning as a downstream epigenetic response. Using inducible gene models to study temporally resolved transcriptional dynamics, we demonstrate that H3K4me3 enrichment significantly lags behind the transcriptional peaks of inflammatory genes such as TNF- and IL-1{beta}, appearing hours after maximal RNA synthesis. This delayed deposition contrasts sharply with the early accumulation of other active histone marks, including H3K27ac and H4K8ac, and with the recruitment of canonical transcriptional regulators such as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II, NF-{kappa}B, and chromatin modifier, histone acetyltransferase p300. Pharmacological inhibition of transcription with Actinomycin D reduces H3K4me3 enrichment, while knockdown of MLL1 abolishes H3K4me3 without affecting gene activation, indicating that H3K4me3 deposition is transcription-dependent but dispensable for transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, analysis of the constitutively active MYC gene suggests that post-transcriptional H3K4me3 deposition may be a general feature of active transcription. Together, these findings redefine H3K4me3 as a post-transcriptional histone mark, revealing an unexpected layer of epigenetic regulation with broad implications for gene expression control.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

ObjectiveTo estimate the impacts of federal policy changes on PrEP coverage, new HIV infections and costs associated with new HIV infections

DesignEstimation of excess HIV infections under different policy impacts were conducted using parameters from a previously published ecological model of the relationship between PrEP coverage and new HIV infections. Costs were estimated for the treatment of infections not averted under different scenarios.

SettingUnited States

ParticipantsThere was no individual participation in research activities; population- based data sources were used to describe the population-level PrEP use and new diagnoses under different hypothetical changes in PrEP coverage.

ExposuresPercent of people with indications for PrEP who are taking PrEP

Main Outcome and MeasuresEstimated change in new HIV infections under different assumptions of change in PrEP coverage; costs of treatment for avoidable HIV infections and net costs of avoidable infections after accounting for costs of PrEP medications.

ResultsEven modest reductions in PrEP coverage would result in thousands of avoidable HIV infections. An absolute 3.3% annual reduction in PrEP coverage over the next decade would result in 8,618 avoidable HIV infections, with lifetime medical costs of $3.6 billion (discounted) for treatment of the unaverted HIV infections.

Conclusions and RelevanceChanges in policy that reduce PrEP uptake would result in avoidable HIV infections and increased costs for HIV treatment. Maintaining policies and programs that support PrEP uptake offers benefits for health and is estimated to result in net cost savings.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat are the likely impacts on HIV transmissions and healthcare costs if policy changes result in decreased PrEP utilization in the United States?

FindingsUnder assumptions of even modest reductions in PrEP use, we estimated thousands of HIV infections would fail to be averted over the next decade, and billions of dollars of additional treatment costs would accrue to the healthcare system.

Results of the studyWe used historical descriptive data on the US HIV epidemic to quantify the relationship between PrEP coverage and trends in HIV diagnoses and to estimate future trends in HIV infections if PrEP coverage were to be rolled back. If PrEP use declines modestly - about 3% annually - we estimate that 8,618 new infections would fail to be averted in a decade because of lowered PrEP uptake, and the estimated lifetime medical costs of these unaverted infections would be $3.6 billion (discounted).

MeaningChanges in healthcare priorities and policies, especially those that increase out of pocket costs of PrEP or reduce the convenience of engaging in PrEP care, risk rolling back our progress in ending the HIV epidemic, accruing avertable HIV infections, and incurring increased costs for medical care of people whose HIV infections were avoidable.","NA","medrxiv",1753308667464

We reconstructed 972 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connection with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation.

Simultaneously, pathogens secrete effectors to promote host colonization through various mechanisms, including targeted host microbiota manipulation. Here, we characterize the Av2 effector of the vascular wilt fungus Verticillium dahliae as a suppressor of the cry for help. Inspired by in silico antimicrobial activity prediction, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of Av2 in vitro. Furthermore, its role in V. dahliae virulence was assessed through microbiota sequencing of inoculated plants, microbial co-cultivation assays, and inoculations in a gnotobiotic plant cultivation system. We show that Av2 inhibits bacterial growth, and acts as a virulence factor during host colonization. Microbiota sequencing revealed involvement of Av2 in suppression of Pseudomonas spp. recruitment upon plant inoculation with V. dahliae, suggesting that Av2 suppresses the cry for help. We show that several Pseudomonas spp. are antagonistic to V. dahliae and sensitive to Av2 treatment. We conclude that V. dahliae secretes Av2 to supress the cry for help by inhibiting the recruitment of antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. to pave the way for successful plant invasion.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

In unicellular bacteria, the ParMRC DNA partitioning apparatus is well known for forming actin-like filaments that push low copy number plasmids to opposite cell poles. In multicellular cyanobacteria such as Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the presence of a chromosomally encoded ParMR system suggests it may play an analogous role in chromosome segregation. However, we show here that it instead constitutes a novel cytoskeletal system - termed CorMR - whose loss does not impair DNA segregation but leads to severe morphological defects, revealing a role in maintaining cell shape. Using live-cell imaging and in vitro reconstitution experiments, we demonstrate that CorM forms dynamically instable filaments. These filaments are recruited to the membrane by CorR, which has acquired a conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Cryo-EM analysis reveals that CorM forms antiparallel double-stranded filaments, in contrast to the polar, parallel filament pair seen in ParM. Furthermore, CorMR filaments are excluded from the cell poles and division plane by MinC, via a long N-terminal extension also specific to multicellular cyanobacteria. Comparative genomics suggests that cyanobacterial multicellularity co-evolved with the chromosomal relocation of ParMR genes, acquisition of the amphipathic helix in CorR, and functional extension of MinC, supporting an evolutionary link among these features. Our findings uncover a striking repurposing of ancestral biochemical systems, expanding the known roles of ParMR and Min systems beyond plasmid segregation and division site selection to include regulation of cell shape.

ImportanceThe ParMRC system is a well-characterized machinery for the segregation of low-copy-number plasmids to the cell poles and, until now, was primarily described to be encoded on plasmids. We found that during the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, a chromosome-encoded ParMR system has undergone extensive evolutionary and functional repurposing, resulting in a previously undescribed bacterial cytoskeletal system that controls cell shape. We also found that this new cytoskeleton, called CorMR, is under the control of the MinCDE system, which has evolved to not only antagonize Z-ring formation, but also to regulate CorM polymerization. Such interplay between different cytoskeletal systems highlights an intricate regulatory mechanism linking cell division and morphology. As this repurposing of existing cytoskeletal system coincided with the emergence of multicellularity in cyanobacteria, it may have played a key role for the evolution of cyanobacteria with distinct cell shapes. Overall, our discovery highlights the plasticity of bacterial polymeric systems and gives insight into the evolution of cellular and multicellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Understanding how the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) can be used as a measure of diet quality to create benchmarks for national nutrition monitoring can assist in surveillance and improve the design of nutrition programs and policies.

ObjectiveTo examine the utility of the HEI-2020 to create benchmarks for national diet quality monitoring.

MethodsThis serial cross-sectional study used data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Nationally representative data for 22,168 US adults ([&ge;]20 years) who completed two 24-hour recalls were analyzed. We derived HEI-2020 scores (0-100) from participants two 24-hour dietary recalls. Diet quality categories were established: high diet quality (>70-100), marginal (>60-70), low (>50-60), and very low (0-50).

ResultsOnly 13% of US adults had high diet quality while nearly two-thirds had low or very low diet quality. Diet quality was higher for older adults, female, ""Other"" race or ethnicity, born outside of the US, have higher education attainment, higher income, and food security. Compared to adults with high diet quality, adults with very low diet quality had lower intakes of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and seafood and the highest intakes of ultra-processed foods, refined grains, and red and processed meats (all P-trends <0.01). Adults with very low diet quality were more likely to have elevated adiposity, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides, fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (all P-trends [&le;]0.01).

ConclusionsThe HEI-2020 is a robust measure of diet quality that can be directly linked to biological measures associated with chronic disease risk. Using evidence-based HEI categories could allow policymakers, public health practitioners, and nutrition professionals to set benchmarks and nationwide targets for achieving improved diet quality.","NA","medrxiv",1753308667464

How these cancer-specific methylation changes are established in the decades before cancer, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use a unique collection of longitudinal blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia to sensitively track the dynamics of DNA methylation changes at high temporal resolution. We identify thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that exhibit altered patterns of methylation up to 10 years before acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) diagnosis. Most of these DMRs are strongly associated with expanding clones carrying somatic driver mutations. We identify a subset of  epigenetic driver DMRs characterised by recurrent CpG alterations that are highly shared across pre-AML cases. These are likely to reflect early epigenetic reprogramming associated with AML development. We also reveal large numbers of stochastic  passenger CpGs whose differential methylation results from hitch-hiking with clonal expansions driven by somatically acquired genetic events. These passenger CpGs can be exploited for lineage tracing to discover clonal expansions driven by missing driver mutations. Our findings show widespread changes in methylation patterns during the early stages of cancer development which could be utilised for risk prediction and therapeutic intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1753308667464

Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue.

Accurate perturbation response models could drastically accelerate drug discovery by reducing the space of interventions that need to be tested in the wet lab. However, recent studies have shown that FM-based models often struggle to outperform simpler baselines for perturbation response prediction. A key obstacle is the lack of understanding of the components driving performance in FM-based perturbation response models.
