In November 2023, we sampled 15 female deer in a captive facility in central Texas, USA. All individuals had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 11 had RT-qPCR-positive respiratory swabs; one also had a positive rectal swab. Six of 11 respiratory swabs yielded infectious virus with replication kinetics of most samples displaying lower growth 24-48 h post infection in vitro when compared to Omicron lineages isolated from humans in Texas in the same period. However, virus growth was similar between groups by 72 h, suggesting no strong attenuation of deer-derived virus. All deer viruses clustered in XBB Omicron clade, with more mutations than expected compared to contemporaneous viruses in humans, suggesting that crossing the species barrier to deer was accompanied by a high substitution rate.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560719

Targeted metabolomics provided a fingerprint of 189 intracellular metabolites, while transcriptomics offered insights into cellular programs modulated by SLC expression. Beyond the metabolic profiles of 102 SLCs directly related to their known substrates, we also identified putative substrates or metabolic pathway connections for 71 SLCs without previously annotated bona fide substrates, including SLC45A4 as a new polyamine transporter. By comparing the molecular profiles, we identified functionally related SLC groups, including some with distinct impacts on osmolyte balancing and glycosylation. The assessment of functionally related human genes presented here may serve as a blueprint for other systematic studies of human gene function and supports future investigations into the functional roles of SLCs.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

There are uncertainties about whether treatments in the acute or post-acute phase of infection can prevent PCC. We report an update to a previous systematic review on the effects of interventions to prevent PCC.

MethodsWe updated our previous peer-reviewed searches on February 9, 2024. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature resources to identify trials and comparative observational studies reporting on any intervention provided during the acute (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or post-acute phase (4-8 weeks) of COVID-19 and our primary outcome of incidence of PCC, ascertained at 3 months or longer following infection and capturing, at a minimum, symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and one or more aspects of cognitive function. Non-recovery from COVID-19 was included if necessary. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, breathlessness/dyspnea, post-exertional malaise, health-related quality of life, psychopathology, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, return to work/education, and adverse effects of the intervention. For screening we employed artificial intelligence to prioritize records and modified our methods to rely on single-reviewer screening after 50% of citations were screened in duplicate. Study selection and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers and data extraction relied on verification of another reviewers work. We grouped studies by intervention type and timing, and by acute-care setting, and performed meta-analysis where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary outcome, excluding studies with high risk of bias, using non-recovery as a proxy outcome, and evaluating the outcome at more than 12 months of follow-up. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

ResultsTwenty-four studies (5 randomized and 19 non-randomized), all among adults, were included. The acute care setting in nine studies was outpatient and in 15 studies was in-patient; all but one intervention was administered during the acute-phase of illness. The use of convalescent plasma in outpatient acute COVID-19 care probably does not reduce the risk of PCC (relative risk [RR]: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.12; 1 RCT; moderate certainty). There was low-certainty evidence suggesting that probiotics (RR [95% CI]: 0.32 [0.13-0.78]; 1 RCT) and metformin (0.50 [0.25-0.99]; 1 RCT among individuals with a BMI [&ge;]25 kg/m2) reduce PCC to a small-to-moderate extent in outpatients, while ivermectin (outpatients), antivirals (outpatients), steroids (in-patients), and therapeutic-dose heparin (vs. prophylactic dose; in-patients) may not be effective. Evidence was very low certainty for several other acute-phase pharmacologic intervention and post-acute outpatient assessment and referrals. For outpatient antiviral treatment, while overall PCC risk may not decrease, there might be a slight reduction in psychopathology. Similarly, inpatient antiviral use may not prevent PCC but may offer a small reduction in prolonged general malaise after light exertion. Therapeutic-dose heparin may slightly reduce the risk of cognitive impairment compared to prophylactic-dose heparin among in-patients. The findings remained consistent across all these sensitivity analyses.

ConclusionsEvidence suggests that PCC can be prevented to some extent among outpatients with the use of probiotics and metformin during the acute phase of COVID-19. Effects from interventions used among in-patients and within the post-acute phase are uncertain at this time. Evidence on commonly recommended interventions including rehabilitation or multidisciplinary care was lacking.

Cellular senescence, characterized by the irreversible cessation of cell division, is a critical process in placental function and its dysregulation has been implicated in pregnancy complications like preterm birth. Senescence can be induced by various stressors, including oxidative stress, DNA damage, and viral infections. Method of Study: In this study, we determined whether COVID-19 had an impact on placental senescence. We examined placentas from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=10 term, 4 preterm) compared to uninfected controls (n=10 term, 3 preterm). The placentas were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication (Spike and Nucleocapsid viral proteins), markers of DNA damage ({gamma}H2AX) and oxidative stress (ROS), and senescence (telomere length; cell cycle regulators, SASP). Results: While no overall differences in cellular senescence markers were observed between the COVID-19 positive and negative groups, we found increased secreted SASP markers and confocal microscopy revealed localized areas of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the placentas from COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions: These findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces localized placental damage, warranting further investigation into its impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Here, we report the structure of the complete extracellular flagellum, encompassing the hook, hook-filament junction, filament, and cap. This structure reveals intermediates of filament assembly, providing a molecular blueprint for flagellin folding and insertion at the filament tip. Mutagenesis and functional assays demonstrate the crucial roles of the terminal regions of the cap in flagellin incorporation, and of the structural integrity of the hook-filament junction. Finally, the structure of the cap and hook-filament junction prior to filament assembly reveals the structural basis for the initiation of filament assembly. Collectively, this study provides comprehensive insights into flagellum assembly and how flagellin incorporation is coupled with its secretion.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Here, we report the first structures of monomeric human GPR155 and two distinct dimers, revealing an inward-open transporter domain and an inactivated GPCR domain with a unique luminal loop 7 conformation occupying orthosteric pocket. The dimeric assembly is cholesterol-sensitive: at low cholesterol, the transporter domain resembles plant PIN transporters and transports auxin molecules; at high cholesterol, it forms a unique dimer stabilized by cholesterol.

Whether axolotls display epigenetic hallmarks of ageing remains unknown. Here, we probe the axolotl DNA methylome throughout lifespan and present its first epigenetic clocks. Both at tissue-specific or pan-tissue levels, the clocks are biphasic, capable of predicting age during early life but not for the rest of its lifespan. We show that axolotls exhibit evolutionarily conserved features of epigenetic ageing during early life, yet their methylome is remarkably stable across lifespan, including at Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target sites, suggesting that this species deviates from known patterns of epigenetic ageing. Lastly, we uncover structure-specific rejuvenation events upon regeneration. This study provides molecular insights into negligible senescence and furthers our understanding of the interplay between regeneration and ageing.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

In cell culture this can occur by the induction of intercellular membrane connections known as tunnelling nanotube-like structures (TLSs), which are capable of trafficking the viral genome between cells. Here, we showed that TLSs are present at the site of IAV infections in vivo, and then used in vitro models to ask how IAVs induce their formation. We found that TLS induction cannot be induced by cytokine signalling from infected to uninfected cells, but requires IAV replication within cells. IAV replication can form filamentous virions with structural similarities to TLSs, but we found that TLS induction is independent of virion morphology. We therefore looked at the intracellular responses to infection. Using a pan-caspase inhibitor, we found that TLS induction by IAVs requires the onset of apoptosis. Our results, which suggest that IAVs control their ability to spread directly from cell to cell by driving infected cells into apoptosis, identifies a new way in which a virus can manipulate its host to evade antiviral immune responses.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

ME/CFS diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME/CFS patients' low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n<100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME/CFS cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME/CFS status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME/CFS cases' restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME/CFS status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME/CFS status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the 'healthy volunteer' selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME/CFS diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

The functionality of these anchors is influenced by the residence time of CTCF on chromatin, which is determined by its binding affinity and its interactions with nucleosomes and other chromatin-associated factors. In this study, we demonstrate that CTCF occupancy is driven by CTCF motifs strategically positioned at the entry sites of a well-positioned nucleosome, such that, upon binding, the N-terminus of CTCF is oriented towards the nucleosome. We refer to this nucleosome as the CTCF priming nucleosome (CpN). CTCF recognizes its binding sites if they are not methylated. It can then displace the CpN, provided the nucleosome is not marked by CpG methylation or repressive histone modifications. Under these permissive conditions, the N-terminus of CTCF recruits SMARCA5 to reposition the CpN downstream, thereby creating nucleosome-free regions that enhance CTCF occupancy and cohesin stalling. In contrast, when CpNs carry repressive epigenetic marks, CTCF binding is transient, without nucleosome displacement or chromatin opening. In such cases, cohesin is not effectively retained at CTCF binding sites. We propose that the epigenetic status of CpNs governs cell-specific CTCF binding patterns, ensuring the maintenance of chromatin architecture throughout the cell cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

The importance of this system to neuronal function is reflected by the prevalence of risk variants in components of the system in several neurodegenerative diseases, ranging from Parkinson's to Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, our understanding of endocytic cargo and core endolysosomal machinery in neurons is limited, in part due to technical limitations. Here, we developed a toolkit for capturing EEA1-postive endosomes (Endo-IP) and TMEM192-positive lysosomes (Lyso-IP) in stem cell-derived induced neurons (iNeurons). We demonstrated its utility by revealing the endolysosomal protein landscapes for cortical-like iNeurons and stem cells. This allowed us to globally profile endocytic cargo, identifying hundreds of transmembrane proteins, including neurogenesis and synaptic proteins, as well as endocytic cargo with predicted SNX17 or SNX27 recognition motifs. By contrast, parallel lysosome profiling reveals a simpler protein repertoire, reflecting in part temporally controlled recycling or degradation for many endocytic targets. This system will facilitate mechanistic interrogation of endolysosomal components found as risk factors in neurodegenerative disease.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Combination of variant effect data from several such experiments provides the opportunity to conduct large-scale analyses of variant effect scores measured across proteins, but can be complicated by variations in the phenotypes that are probed across experiments. Thus, using variant effect datasets obtained with similar MAVE techniques can help reveal general rules governing the effects of amino acid variation for a single molecular phenotype. In this work, we accordingly combined data from six individual variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) experiments and analysed a total of 31,614 variant effect scores reporting solely on the impact of single amino acid residue substitutions on the cellular abundance of proteins. Using our combined variant effect dataset, we derived and analysed a collection of amino acid substitution matrices describing the average impact on cellular abundance of all residue substitution types in different structural environments. We found that the substitution matrices predict the cellular abundance of protein variants with surprisingly high accuracy when given structural information only in the form of whether a residue is buried or exposed. We thus propose our substitution matrix-based predictions as strong baselines for future abundance model development.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Downstream effectors activated by cOAs are typically non-specific proteins that induce damage to essential cellular components, thereby preventing phage epidemics. Due to these toxic effects, it is crucial that the production and concentration of cOAs remain under tight regulatory control during infection-free periods or when deactivating the immune response after clearing an infection. Type III CRISPR loci often encode enzymes known as ring nucleases (RNs) that bind and degrade specific cOAs, while some effectors are auto-deactivating. Despite the discovery of several classes of RNs, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of type III CRISPR-Cas loci in this context is lacking. Here, we examined 38,742 prokaryotic genomes to provide a global overview of type III CRISPR loci, focussing on the known and predicted RNs. The candidate RNs Csx16 and Csx20 are confirmed as active enzymes, joining Crn1-3. Distributions and patterns of co-occurrence of RNs and associated effectors are explored, allowing the conclusion that a sizeable majority of type III CRISPR systems regulate cOA levels by degrading the signalling molecules, which has implications for cell fate following viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

At late time points of interactions, CCR7 ligands repositioned the F-actin-promoting factor DOCK2 away from the DC interface to enable CD8+ T cell detachment, proliferation onset and acquisition of cytotoxicity. Lack of CCR7 signaling, as during ex vivo activation or in chronically inflamed lymphoid tissue, caused sustained T cell-DC interactions, and generated dysfunctional TEFF with high expression of inhibitory receptors, impaired antimicrobial activity, and poor recall responses.

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Previous studies have reported that overexpression of ASCL1 or combinations of proneural factors in Muller glia (MG) induces regeneration of functional neurons in the adult mouse retina. Recently, we applied the same strategy in dissociated cultures of fetal human MG and although we stimulated neurogenesis from MG, our effect in 2D cultures was modest and our analysis of newborn neurons was limited. In this study, we aimed to improve our MG reprogramming strategy in a more intact retinal environment. For this purpose, we used an in vitro culture system of human fetal retinal tissue and adult human postmortem retina. To stimulate reprogramming, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver constructs with a glial-specific promoter (HES1) driving ASCL1 alone or in combination with additional developmental transcription factors such as ATOH1 and NEUROD1. Combining IHC, scRNA-seq and electrophysiology, we show for the first time that human MG can generate new neurons even in adults.

These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered during flight like a flag in the wind. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats.

To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet (Transcriptional Effector Network) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs.

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

In this study, we investigated the biogeographic history and genomic diversity across the range of the zebra longwing butterfly Heliconius charithonia, a species with a widespread distribution in the Neotropics, but which is phenotypically homogenous across its range. We examined whole genome sequence data from 55 individuals from the eight described subspecies. We infer that there were at least two distinct colonization events of the Caribbean islands from the mainland. The second colonization wave occurred relatively recently, accounting for the genetic homogeneity observed across the species' range. Despite low divergence across most of the genome, two large non-recombining genomic regions showed deeply divergent haplotypes that correspond to chromosomal inversions. Phylogenetic analyses indicate ancient origins of these inversion polymorphisms, and there is no evidence that they were introgressed from another extant lineage of Heliconius. These ancient polymorphisms are likely maintained by heterogeneous selection across the landscape, with the inversion on chromosome 19 likely playing a role in local adaptation to cold and desiccation.

This was achieved by isolating a strain of Pseudomonas umsongensis able to use the PET monomer terephthalate as carbon source, engineering the strain to effectively secrete the high-activity PET hydrolase PHL7 through the addition of a recombinant TAT secretion leader sequence, and enhancing the bioavailability of PET by transforming it into an amorphous and macroporous structure by pre-treatment with an organic solvent. Our findings demonstrate the direct microbial consumption of PET, which could lead to improved and more sustainable upcycling strategies for this plastic.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Endogenous electric fields, generated by the disruption of the transepithelial potential across the skin, help to guide the movement of immune and skin cells toward the wound site. However, the mechanisms by which cells sense these physical cues remain largely unknown. Through a CRISPR-based screen, we identified Galvanin, a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein that is required for human neutrophils to change their direction of migration in response to an applied electric field. Our results indicate that Galvanin rapidly relocalizes to the anodal side of a cell on exposure to an electric field, and that the net charge on its extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient to drive this relocalization. The spatial pattern of neutrophil protrusion and retraction changes immediately upon Galvanin relocalization, suggesting that it acts as a direct sensor of the electric field that then transduces spatial information about a cell's electrical environment to the migratory apparatus. The apparent mechanism of cell steering by sensor relocalization represents a new paradigm for directed cell migration.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

We demonstrate that emergence of pathogenic Leptospira correlated with SOD loss, but that a long-lasting adaptation to superoxide remains possible. We reveal that cysteine and leucine biosynthesis are the most induced pathways in response to superoxide and demonstrate the importance of sulfur metabolism in superoxide adaptation in this SOSE-deficient model. We also propose cysteine oxidation as a key mediator of superoxide toxicity in the absence of SOSEs. This study challenges our conventional understanding of the oxygen toxicity theory and proposes a new model of superoxide adaptation through metabolic rewiring in bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

This technique produces networks where each target node is associated with a set of source nodes that are capable of providing explanatory power for its dynamics. Multivariate Transfer Entropy (TE) has proven to be a popular and effective tool for inferring these networks. Recently, a continuous-time estimator of TE for event-based data such as spike trains has been developed which, in more efficiently representing event data in terms of inter-event intervals, is significantly more capable of measuring multivariate interactions. The new estimator thus presents an opportunity to more effectively use TE for the inference of effective networks from spike trains, and we demonstrate in this paper for the first time its efficacy at this task. Using data generated from models of spiking neurons -- for which the ground-truth connectivity is known -- we demonstrate the accuracy of this approach in various dynamical regimes. We further show that it exhibits far superior inference performance to a pairwise TE-based approach as well as a recently-proposed convolutional neural network approach. Moreover, comparison with Generalised Linear Models (GLMs), which are commonly applied to spike-train data, showed clear benefits, particularly in cases of high synchrony. Finally, we demonstrate its utility in revealing the patterns by which effective connections develop from recordings of developing neural cell cultures.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Metabolic pathway kinases (VIP1/VIHs) leading to the production of PP-InsPs are now well characterized in yeast and plants. Previously, the wheat inositol pyrophosphate kinase (TaVIH2) was shown to encode a catalytic active kinase domain. Heterologous expression of TaVIH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana showed enhanced drought tolerance by modulating the cell composition. In this study, we attempted to identify the interacting protein targets of wheat VIH2-3B using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library screen, identifying 52 putative interactors that are primarily involved in cell wall-related functions. Notably, fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein (FLA7), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein emerged as the most frequently interacting partner in the screen. Further analysis using pull-down assays validated the interaction between TaVIH2-3B and TaFLA7 in vivo. Using the reporter fusion studies, we observed the localization of TaFLA7 to be a plasma membrane. We also observed that this localization of the FLA7 was perturbed in the yeast vip1delta strain. The expression of TaVIH2-3B bearing PP-InsP5K enzymatic activity in yeast mutants rescued the localisation of the FLA7 to the membrane. Expression analysis of TaFLA7 showed differential expression response under drought in wheat shoot tissues. TaFLA7 was also found to be highly expressed during grain development, particularly in the endosperm and seed coat during grain maturation. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential role of TaVIH2 in cell wall remodelling and stress response pathways, offering new insights into the functional roles of VIH proteins in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

They stand out from other animals due to their simple body plans. They lack organs, body cavities, muscles and a nervous system and have only seven broadly defined morphological cell types, each with a unique distribution. Analyses of single cell transcriptomes of four species of placozoans revealed greater diversity of secretory cell types than evident from morphological studies, but the locations of many of these new cell types were unknown and it was unclear which morphological cell types they represent. Furthermore, there were contradictions between the conclusions of previous studies and the single cell RNAseq studies. To address these issues, we used mRNA probes for genes encoding secretory products expressed in different metacells in Trichoplax adhaerens to localize cells in whole mounts and in dissociated cell cultures, where their morphological features could be visualized and identified. The nature and functions of their secretory granules were further investigated with electron microscopic techniques and by imaging secretion in live animals during feeding episodes. We found that two cell types participate in disintegrating prey, one resembling a lytic cell type in mammals and another combining features of zymogen gland cells and enterocytes. We identified secretory epithelial cells expressing glycoproteins or short peptides implicated in defense. We located seven peptidergic cell types and two types of mucocytes. Our findings reveal mechanisms that placozoans use to feed and protect themselves from pathogens and clues about neuropeptidergic signaling.

We have previously described a central role for CDK1 at the nexus of adhesion signalling and cell cycle progression, demonstrating that CDK1 has a non-canonical role in regulating integrin adhesion complexes and in the migration of cancer cells in 3D interstitial matrix. Here we show that the CDK1 binding partners cyclinB1 and cyclinA2 also have roles in cell migration and invasion in both cancer and non-transformed cells. CyclinB1 plays a key role in RhoA activation to promote rear retraction in a membrane tension dependent manner, while cyclinA2 has a general role in promoting motility. Knockdown of either cyclin significantly perturbs migration with contrasting phenotypes, while knockdown of both together has an additive effect which arrests both migration and division. We find that the cell migration specific role of CDK1 is independent of cell-cycle phase, with inhibition or knockdown of CDK1 perturbing migration in G0/G1 arrested cells, while CDK1-cyclin expression correlates strongly with invasive potential of bladder cancer cell lines. Our findings therefore describe how cyclin-CDK1 complexes orchestrate migration as well as division of cells and that cyclinA2-CDK1 and cyclinB1-CDK1 complexes play distinct roles in motility. Furthermore, these findings suggest that targeting CDK1 signalling in aggressive and invasive tumours may have an unexpected dual potential to combat metastasis in addition to proliferation.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Using established sequence-to-structure relationships, it is possible to generate various coiled-coil assemblies with predictable numbers and orientations of helices. Here we target new assemblies, namely A3B3 heterohexamer alpha-helical barrels. These designs are based on pairs of sequences with 3-heptad repeats (abcdefg) programmed with a = Leu, d = Ile, e = Ala, and g = Ser, and b = c = Glu to make the acidic (A) chains and b = c = Lys in the basic (B) chains. These design rules ensure that the desired oligomeric state and stoichiometry are readily achieved. However, controlling the orientation of neighboring helices (parallel or anti- parallel) is less straightforward. Surprisingly, we find that assembly and helix orientation are sensitive to the starting position of the heptad repeats (the register) in the peptide sequences. Peptides starting at g (g-register) form a parallel 6-helix barrel in solution and in an X-ray crystal structure, whereas the b- and c-register peptides form an antiparallel complex. In lieu of experimental X-ray structures for b- and c-register peptides, AlphaFold-Multimer is used to predict atomistic models. However, considerably more sampling than the default value is required to match the models and the experimental data, as many confidently predicted and plausible models are generated with incorrect helix orientations.

Recombination rates are widely observed to negatively associate with the abundance of transposable elements (TEs), selfish genetic elements that move between genomic locations. While such associations are usually interpreted as recombination influencing the efficacy of selection at removing TEs, accumulating findings suggest that TEs could instead be the cause rather than the consequence. To test this prediction, we formally investigated the influence of polymorphic, putatively active TEs on recombination rates. We developed and benchmarked a novel approach that uses PacBio long-read sequencing to efficiently, accurately, and cost-effectively identify crossovers (COs), a key recombination product, among large numbers of pooled recombinant individuals. By applying this approach to Drosophila strains with distinct TE insertion profiles, we found that polymorphic TEs, especially RNA-based TEs and TEs with local enrichment of repressive marks, reduce the occurrence of COs. Such an effect leads to different CO frequencies between homologous sequences with and without TEs, contributing to varying CO maps between individuals. The suppressive effect of TEs on CO is further supported by two orthogonal approaches-analyzing the distributions of COs in panels of recombinant inbred lines in relation to TE polymorphism and applying marker-assisted estimations of CO frequencies to isogenic strains with and without transgenically inserted TEs. Our investigations reveal how the constantly changing mobilome can actively modify recombination landscapes, shaping genome evolution within and between species.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Understanding how alterations in microbiome functioning render this site vulnerable to colonization is essential, as multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) carriage is a major risk factor for developing serious infections. To advance our knowledge of oral MDRO carriage and protection against pathogen colonization conferred by native microbiota, we examined microbiomes from individuals colonized by MDROs (n=33) and non-colonized age-matched controls (n=30). Shotgun metagenomic analyses of oral swabs from study participants revealed significant differences in microbial communities with depletion of Streptococcus spp. among those colonized by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (RGNB), compared to non-carriers. We utilized metagenomic sequencing to characterize the oral resistome and find antimicrobial resistance genes are present in higher abundance among RNGB carriers versus non-carriers. High-throughput co-culture screening revealed oral bacteria isolated from MDRO non-carriers demonstrate greater inhibition of gram-negative pathogens, compared to isolates from carriers. Moreover, biosynthetic gene clusters from streptococci are found in higher abundance from non-carrier microbiomes, compared to RGNB carrier microbiomes. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of extracts from Streptococcus isolate SID2657 demonstrated evidence of strong E. coli and A. baumannii inhibition in a murine model of infection. Together, this provides evidence that oral microbiota shape this dynamic microbial community and may serve as an untapped source for much-needed antimicrobial small-molecules.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

In this paper, we develop a two-compartment mathematical model which incorporates the impact of ICIs on both the heart and the tumour. Such a model can be used to inform the conditions under which autoimmune myocarditis may develop as a consequence of treatment. We use this model in an optimal control framework to design optimized dosing schedules for three types of ICI therapy that balance the positive and negative effects of treatment. We show that including the negative side-effects of ICI treatment explicitly within the mathematical framework significantly impacts the predictions for the optimized dosing schedule, thus stressing the importance of a holistic approach to optimizing cancer therapy regimens.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

The craters harbor the highest density of CD8+ T cells in the tumor. In zebrafish, CD8+ T cells formed prolonged interactions with melanoma cells within craters, characteristic of antigen recognition.

Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation.

To do so, we analyzed electrocardiography (ECG) signals in a total of 56 participants from two existing datasets which contained cerebral responses to local auditory irregularities, but which did not analyze the ECG data before. We found that cardiac activity slowed down after global, but not local, auditory irregularities, revealing the presence of global deviance effect in Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, cardiac activity was faster after local, but not global, deviants in Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, our results demonstrate that cardiac responses to auditory irregularities inform about hierarchical information processing and its variations during sleep beyond cerebral activity. They highlight the embodiment of cognitive function and the value of cardiac signals to understand the variations of sensory processing during sleep.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

We reasoned that while residue level descriptions of biomolecules are efficient for de novo structure prediction, for probing heterogeneity of interactions with small molecules in the folded state an entirely atomic level description could have advantages in speed and generality. We developed a graph neural network called ChemNet trained to recapitulate correct atomic positions from partially corrupted input structures from the Cambridge Structural Database and the Protein Data Bank; the nodes of the graph are the atoms in the system. ChemNet accurately generates structures of diverse organic small molecules given knowledge of their atom composition and bonding, and given a description of the larger protein context, and builds up structures of small molecules and protein side chains for protein-small molecule docking. Because ChemNet is rapid and stochastic, ensembles of predictions can be readily generated to map conformational heterogeneity. In enzyme design efforts described here and elsewhere, we find that using ChemNet to assess the accuracy and pre-organization of the designed active sites results in higher success rates and higher activities; we obtain a preorganized retroaldolase with a kcat/KM of 11000 M-1min-1, considerably higher than any pre-deep learning design for this reaction. We anticipate that ChemNet will be widely useful for rapidly generating conformational ensembles of small molecule and small molecule-protein systems, and for designing higher activity preorganized enzymes.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Fluctuating temperatures can also influence the patterns of cytosine DNA methylation, thereby influencing gene expression. However, whether these epigenetic changes provide an adaptative advantage remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that DNA methylation is required to regulate thermomorphogenesis. Hypomethylated drm1 drm2 cmt3 mutants or seedlings treated with 5-azacytidine to block DNA methylation exhibit reduced hypocotyl growth at warm temperatures, primarily due to impaired cell elongation. Moreover, DNA hypomethylation compromises auxin biosynthesis and transport in response to warmth, partially by reducing PIF4 protein levels. Notably, the loss of DNA methylation leads to increased expression of SUPPRESSOR OF drm1 drm2 cmt3 (SDC), which in turn restricts hypocotyl elongation during thermomorphogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that DNAme regulates the inhibition of SDC expression to promote gibberellin biosynthesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of DNA methylation in modulating gene expression in response to temperature fluctuations and provide new insights into the epigenetic regulation of thermomorphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

However, there are few analogous tools for manipulating the structure of neural circuits. Here, we introduce three rationally designed genetically encoded tools that use E3 ligase-dependent mechanisms to trigger the degradation of synaptic scaffolding proteins, leading to functional ablation of synapses. First, we developed a constitutive excitatory synapse ablator, PFE3, analogous to the inhibitory synapse ablator GFE3. PFE3 targets the RING domain of the E3 ligase Mdm2 and the proteasome-interacting region of Protocadherin 10 to the scaffolding protein PSD-95, leading to efficient ablation of excitatory synapses. In addition, we developed a light-inducible version of GFE3, paGFE3, using a novel photoactivatable complex based on the photocleavable protein PhoCl2c. paGFE3 degrades Gephyrin and ablates inhibitory synapses in response to 400 nm light. Finally, we developed a chemically inducible version of GFE3, chGFE3, which degrades inhibitory synapses when combined with the bio-orthogonal dimerizer, HaloTag ligand-trimethoprim. Each tool is specific, reversible, and capable of breaking neural circuits at precise locations.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Here, we show that laboratory mice have retained gut bacterial symbiont lineages that diversified in parallel (co-diversified) with rodent species for > 25 million years, but that LGM strains of these ancestral symbionts have experienced accelerated accumulation of genetic load during the past [~] 120 years of captivity. Compared to closely related WGM strains, co-diversified LGM strains displayed significantly faster genome-wide rates of fixation of nonsynonymous mutations, indicating elevated genetic drift, a difference that was absent in non-co-diversified symbiont clades. Competition experiments in germ-free mice further indicated that LGM strains within co-diversified clades displayed significantly reduced fitness in vivo compared to WGM relatives to an extent not observed within non-co-diversified clades. Thus, stochastic processes (e.g., bottlenecks), not natural selection in the laboratory, have been the predominant evolutionary forces underlying divergence of co-diversified symbiont strains between laboratory and wild house mice.

A co-culture model system that combines a reporter cell line expressing the fluorescent eCB sensor, GRABeCB2.0, and neuronal cells revealed that neurons release EVs containing 2-AG, but not anandamide, in a stimulus-dependent process regulated by PKC, DAGL, Arf6, and which was sensitive to inhibitors of eCB facilitated diffusion. A vesicle contained approximately 2000 2-AG molecules. Accordingly, hippocampal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity was modulated by Arf6 and transport inhibitors.

Langerhans cells reside in the epidermis and extend dynamic dendrites in close proximity to adjacent keratinocytes and somatosensory peripheral axons. We find that homeostatic Langerhans cells exhibit spontaneous and transient changes in calcium activity, with calcium flux occurring primarily in the cell body and rarely in the dendrites. Triggering somatosensory axon degeneration increases the frequency of calcium activity in Langerhans cell dendrites. By contrast, we show that Langerhans cells exhibit a sustained increase in intracellular calcium following engulfment of damaged keratinocytes. Altering intracellular calcium activity leads to a decrease in engulfment efficiency of keratinocyte debris.

However, the efficacy of editing outcomes is subject to various factors, with template format playing a crucial role. Currently, the predominant non-viral template format for inducing homology-directed repair (HDR) after nuclease-induced DNA breaks is double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), which is toxic when transfected at high doses. Previous studies have demonstrated that using single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with flanking double-stranded Cas-target-sequences (CTS) as a repair template for Cas9-mediated gene editing can mitigate this toxicity and increase knock-in efficiency. Here, we investigate CTS design for AsCas12a Ultra by exploring PAM orientation and binding requirements of the Cas12a-crRNA complex. Additionally, we rule out in vitro ssDNase activity of AsCas12a Ultra under cell-physiological Mg2+ conditions. Finally, we showcase the advantage of using ssDNA with double-stranded CTS end modifications (ssCTS) at high doses for delivering clinically relevant transgenes of varying sizes into three T-cell receptor-CD3 complex genes (TRAC, CD3{zeta}, CD3{varepsilon}), achieving up to 90% knock-in rates for a 0.8kb insert at the CD3{varepsilon} locus. Overall, AsCas12a Ultra and ssCTS donors represent a platform for highly efficient knock-in in primary human T cells with minimal toxicity.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

We found a massive rostrocaudal spread of progenitor clones specific to sensory or sympathetic ganglia, which unlike in the brain, showed robust bilateral distributions. Computational modeling suggested neural crest progenitor fate specification preceded delamination from neural tube. Single-cell multiomic analysis suggested both neurons and glia contributed to the rostrocaudal clonal organization. CRISPR barcoding in mice and live imaging in quail embryos confirmed these clonal dynamics across multiple somite levels.

The molecular basis for these kinetic differences is currently unknown. Here, we used Single Molecule Footprinting to measure RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy, the fraction of DNA molecules bound, at promoters in mouse and Drosophila cell lines. Single molecule data reveals that Pol II occupancy is on average 3-5 times more frequent at transcriptionally active Drosophila promoters than active mouse promoters. Kinetic modelling of the occupancy states suggests that these differences in Pol II occupancy are determined by the ratio between the transcription initiation and Pol II turnover rates. We used chemical perturbation of transcription initiation to determine Pol II turnover rate in both species. Integration of these data into the model shows that infrequent Pol II occupancy in mammals is explained by the combination of high Pol II turnover and low transcription initiation rates.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

However, their elusive nature makes it difficult to estimate population sizes. Current methods used to monitor local population sizes include visually identifying individuals from camera trap photos and genetically identifying individuals from fecal samples using microsatellite loci. Here, we present a new method for identifying snow leopard individuals from fecal samples using a multiplex PCR single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel method. The SNP panel we present consists of 144 SNPs and utilizes next-generation sequencing technology, making it cheaper and easier than current microsatellite methods. We validate our SNP panel with paired tissue and fecal samples from zoo individuals, showing a minimum of 96.7% accuracy in allele calls per run. We then generate SNP data from 235 field-collected fecal samples from across Pakistan to show that the panel can reliably identify individuals from low-quality fecal samples of unknown age and is robust to contamination. We also show that our SNP panel has the capability to identify first-order relatives and provides insights into the geographic origin of samples. This SNP panel will empower the snow leopard research community in their efforts to assess local and global snow leopard population sizes. More broadly, we present a method for developing a SNP panel that utilizes open source software for SNP selection and primer design, Illumina sequencing technology, and a streamlined lab and bioinformatics protocol which can be used to create similar SNP panels for any species of interest for which adequate genomic reference data is available.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of glioma. NLRX1 is an innate immune pattern recognition receptor that exhibits tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects that may be cancer or cell-type, context-dependent, aided by differences in the microenvironment. Here, we report that NLRX1 is differentially expressed in microglia, astrocytes, GBM cell lines, and glioma patient tissues. siRNA-mediated silencing of Nlrx1 decreases the ability of the GBM cell line, LN-229, to proliferate and migrate. Nlrx1-/- GBM cells exhibit attenuated ability to generate 3D spheroids and enhanced capability to form tunneling nanotubes. Moreover, Nlrx1-/- GBM cells show decreased expression of autophagy markers, suggesting that NLRX1 plays a role in maintaining autophagy in GBM. In summary, our findings indicate that NLRX1 may modulate GBM pathophysiology by regulating GBM cell proliferation, migration, and metabolism. We believe our understanding of NLRX1 in GBM pathophysiology paves the potential development of GBM-targeting therapeutics that may delay disease progression and/or improve survival.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Recent advancements in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) techniques tailored for FFPE tissues have demonstrated their feasibility. However, isolation of high-quality nuclei from FFPE tissue with current methods remains challenging due to RNA cross-linking. We, therefore, proposed a novel strategy for the preparation of high-fidelity nuclei from FFPE samples, cryogenic enzymatic dissociation (CED) method, and performed snRandom-seq (snCED-seq) for polyformaldehyde (PFA) -fixed and FFPE brains to verify its applicability. The method is compatible with both PFA-based and FFPE brains or other organs with less hands-on time and lower reagent costs, and produced 10 times more nuclei than the homogenate method, without secondary degradation of RNA, and maximized the retention of RNA molecules within nuclei. snCED-seq shows 1.5-2 times gene and UMI numbers per nucleus, higher gene detection sensitivity and RNA coverage, and a minor rate of mitochondrial and ribosomal genes, compared with the nuclei from traditional method. The correlation gene expression of nucleus from the post-fixed and the frozen sample can be up to 94 %, and the gene expression of our nuclei was more abundant. Moreover, we applied snCED-seq to cellular heterogeneity study of the specimen on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to demonstrate a pilot application. Scarce Cajal Retzius cells in older mice were robustly detected in our data, and we successfully identified two subpopulations of disease-associated in astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes, respectively. Meanwhile, we found that most cell types are affected at the transcriptional level by AD pathology, and there is a disease susceptibility gene set that affects these cell types similarly. Our method provides powerful nuclei for snRNA-seq studies for FFPE specimens, and even helps to reveal multi-omics information of clinical samples.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

However, these dances have attracted little scientific attention and their structure and meaning remain largely obscure. Here we analyse close-range video recordings of captive crested gibbons, extracting descriptions of dance in four Nomascus species (N. annamensis, N. gabriellae, N. leucogenys, and N. siki). Additionally, we report results from a survey amongst relevant professionals clarifying behavioural contexts of dance in captive and wild crested gibbons. Our results demonstrate that dances in Nomascus represent a common and intentional form of visual communication restricted to sexually mature females. While primarily used as a proceptive signal to solicit copulation, dances occur in a wide range of contexts related to arousal and/or frustration in captivity. A linguistically informed view of this sequential behaviour demonstrates that dances follow a grouping organisation and isochronous rhythm - patterns not described for visual displays in other non-human primates. We argue that applying the concept of dance to gibbons allows us to expand our understanding of the communicative behaviours of non-human apes and develop hypotheses on the rules and regularities characterizing this behaviour. We propose that gibbons dances likely evolved from less elaborate rhythmic proceptive signals, similar to those found in siamangs. Although dance displays in humans and crested gibbons share a number of key characteristics, they cannot be assumed to be homologous. Nevertheless, gibbon dances represent a model behaviour whose investigation could be extended to the study of complex gestural signals in hominoid primates.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter species contribute to septic shock fatalities in newborns and immunocompromised adults. The intestine may be a major reservoir for these resistant strains. This leads to the hypothesis that colonizing Enterobacter strains can translocate from the gut to the bloodstream, perhaps in cases involving antibiotic treatment. We sought to establish a neonatal mouse model to investigate the mechanisms underpinning gut colonization by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei. We observed successful colonization and proliferation of E. hormaechei in the five-day old infant mouse gut, with primary localization to the colon following oral inoculation.

Our findings underscore the importance of oxygen-dependent metabolic pathways, including the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine metabolism in gut colonization and proliferation, which aligns with previous human studies. We describe a new mouse model to study gut colonization by Enterobacter species, leading to vital insights into the adaptation of carbapenem-resistant E. hormaechei to the gut environment during the early stages of intestinal colonization. These insights are essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies that can serve as decolonization therapies in at-risk populations.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

An important class of STING agonists are analogs of the endogenous STING agonist, cGAMP, and while transporters for these small molecules are known in some cell types, how they enter and kill T cells remains unknown. Here, we identify the cationic amino acid transporter SLC7A1 as the dominant transporter of cGAMP and its analogs in activated primary mouse and human T cells. T cells upregulate this transporter upon activation and rapid proliferation to meet their high metabolic demand, but this comes at the cost of enabling increased transport and toxicity of cGAMP. To circumvent the essentiality of SLC7A1 to proliferating T cells, we found that the residues responsible for cGAMP transport are separate from the arginine binding pocket allowing us to perturb cGAMP transport and STING-activation mediated killing without impacting arginine transport. These results suggest that SLC7A1 is a potential target for alleviating T cell toxicity associated with cGAMP and its analogs.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

We observe that perivascular fibroblasts switch on distinct matrix programs in response to cytokine signalling from neighbouring cells, forming adapted tissue niches that either permit or restrict immune cell trafficking. Specifically, IFN-gamma responsive fibroblasts form a pathogenic lymphocyte-permissive niche that supports the persistence of leukocytes in the tissue, whilst TGF-beta responsive, matrix-synthesising fibroblasts comprise a reparative niche, composed of a collagen-rich barrier around blood vessels that restricts leukocyte migration and promotes resolution of tissue inflammation.

These methods decompose high-dimensional gene expression profiles into tractable factor representations and prototypical gene expression patterns (components), facilitating the study of cell type variation. However, integrating study covariates within linear DR frameworks remains a challenging task. We present scPCA, a flexible DR framework that jointly models cellular heterogeneity and conditioning variables, allowing it to recover an integrated factor representation and reveal transcriptional changes across conditions and components of the decomposition. We show that scPCA extracts an interpretable latent representation by analyzing unstimulated and IFN-beta-treated PBMCs, and showcase that the model may be employed to effectively address batch effects. We examine age-related changes in rodent lung cell populations, uncovering a previously unreported surge in Ccl5 expression in T cells. We illustrate how scPCA may be employed to identify coordinated transcriptional changes across multiple time-points in depolarized visual cortex neurons. Finally, we show that scPCA elucidates transcriptional shifts in CRISPR-Cas9 chordin knockout zebrafish fish single-cell data despite large difference cell abundance across conditions. Since scPCA introduces a general approach to account for conditioning variables in high-dimensional data, it may also be applicable to datasets other than scRNA-seq.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

While the occurrence of RV-specific IgA-producing plasma cells is temporarily blunted, maternally protected pups do mount delayed protective humoral immunity after weaning. Fate-mapping of pre-existing B cells revealed that the RV-specific plasma cell pool originates from B cells imprinted at the time of virus exposure regardless of maternal protection. Our data challenges the dogma that maternal antibody is inhibitory and instead permits safe and efficacious immune education in the growing organism.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

It also examined the temporal patterns and variability of this effect across different subpopulations by analyzing the association between COVID-19 vaccination and non-COVID-19 mortality in Qatar.

MethodsTwo matched, retrospective cohort studies assessed the incidence of non-COVID-19 death in national cohorts of individuals with a primary series vaccination versus no vaccination (two-dose analysis), and individuals with three-dose (booster) vaccination versus primary series vaccination (three-dose analysis), from January 5, 2021, to April 9, 2024.

ResultsThe adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for non-COVID-19 death was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.90) in the two-dose analysis and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.67-1.07) in the three-dose analysis. In the first six months of follow-up in the two-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.35 (95% CI: 0.27-0.46); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.52 (95% CI: 1.19-1.94). In the first six months of follow-up in the three-dose analysis, the aHR was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-0.50); however, the combined analysis of all subsequent periods showed an aHR of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02-1.85). The overall effectiveness of the primary series and third-dose vaccinations against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.0-97.1) and 34.1% (95% CI: -46.4-76.7), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the healthy vaccinee effect is pronounced among those aged 50 years and older and among those more clinically vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

ConclusionA strong healthy vaccinee effect was observed in the first six months following vaccination. This effect may have stemmed from a lower likelihood of vaccination among seriously ill, end-of-life individuals, and less mobile elderly populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

Participants received 5 or 10 mg / week of compounded rapamycin, or placebo for 48 weeks. Safety, adverse events (AEs) and blood biomarkers were collected. Efficacy was assessed using DEXA scan-based measures and standardized surveys assessing quality of life (QoL) and frailty. We did not detect significant differences in safety blood biomarkers, or moderate to severe AEs between the rapamycin treatment groups and placebo after 48 weeks. We detected dose-dependent (10 mg group) and sex-specific improvements in lean tissue mass, pain, social functioning, overall QoL, and overall osteoarthritis score in females, and in bone mineral content in men. Additionally, some individuals receiving rapamycin experienced significant improvements in body composition metrics that were associated with beneficial changes in gut health and lipid metabolism. We conclude that low-dose, intermittent rapamycin administration over the course of 48 weeks is safe and induces sex-specific improvements in multiple aspects of healthspan, with the most robust improvements in lean tissue mass in women taking 10 mg rapamycin/week.

We report genome-wide data from 248 ancient individuals from the largely unsampled period 100-800 CE and co-analyze them with previously reported data. In the Roman era, we document profound demographic transformation, with an influx of people with ancestry from the Central and Eastern Mediterranean in all the areas under study and of North Africans, especially in central and southern Iberia. Germanic (Buri, Suebi, Vandals & Visigoths) and Sarmatian (Alans) took over political control beginning in the 5th century, and although we identify individuals with Germanic-associated ancestry at sites with Germanic-style ornaments and observe that such individuals were closely related across large distances as in the case of two siblings separated by 700 km, for Iberia as a whole, we observe high continuity with the previous Hispano-Roman population. The demographic patterns in Iberia contrast sharply with those in Britain, which showed the opposite pattern of little change in the Roman period followed by great change in the Migration period, and also from demographic patterns in the central Mediterranean where both periods were associated with profound transformation, raising broader questions about the forces that precipitated change over this time.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

C_LI

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

We aimed to test whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) estimated using different epigenetic clocks predict long-term overall, cardiovascular or cancer mortality.

MethodsWe analyzed data from 2,105 participants to the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged [&ge;]50 years old who were followed for mortality through 2019. EAAs was calculated from the residuals of Horvath, Hannum, SkinBlood, Pheno, Zhang, Lin, Weidner, Vidal-Bralo and Grim epigenetic clocks regressed on chronological age. Using cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association of EAA (per 5-year) and the DunedinPoAm pace of aging (per 10% increase) with overall, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, adjusting for covariates and white blood cell composition.

ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 17.5 years, 998 deaths occurred, including 272 from cardiovascular disease and 209 from cancer. Overall mortality was most significantly predicted by Grim EAA (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.32-1.71) followed by Hannum (P = 0.001; HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07-1.27), Pheno (P = 0.001; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.05-1.21), Horvath (P = 0.007; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.22) and Vidal-Bralo (P = 0.008; HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.23) EAAs. Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.0001; HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.29-1.86), whereas Hannum (P = 0.006; HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.44), Horvath (P = 0.02; HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.02-1.35) and Grim (P = 0.049; HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00-1.87) EAAs predicted cancer mortality. DunedinPoAm pace of aging was associated with overall (P = 0.003; HR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.38) and cardiovascular (P = 0.04; HR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.01-1.55) mortality.

ConclusionsIn a U.S. representative sample, Horvath, Hannum, Pheno, Vidal-Bralo and Grim EAA all predicted overall mortality but only Grim EAA predicted cardiovascular mortality and Horvath, Hannum or Grim EAA predicted cancer mortality. Pace of aging predicted overall and cardiovascular mortality.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

These data will be used by the GIAB Consortium to develop matched tumor-normal benchmarks for somatic variant detection. In addition, extensive data from two different normal tissues from the same individual can enable understanding of mosaicism. Long reads also contain methylation tags for epigenetic analyses. We expect these data to facilitate innovation for whole genome measurement technologies, de novo assembly of tumor and normal genomes, and bioinformatic tools to identify small and structural somatic mutations.

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document.

Real-time genomic surveillance using offers the potential to detect otherwise unidentified outbreaks. We initiated and evaluated the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-associated Transmission (EDS-HAT), a real-time genomic surveillance program for outbreak detection and mitigation.

MethodsThis study was conducted at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital from November 2021 to October 2023. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed weekly on healthcare-associated clinical bacterial isolates to identify otherwise undetected outbreaks. Interventions were implemented in real-time based on identified transmission. A clinical and economic impact analysis was conducted to estimate infections averted and net cost savings.

ResultsThere were 3,921 bacterial isolates from patient healthcare-associated infections that underwent WGS, of which 476 (12.1%) clustered into 172 outbreaks (size range 2-16 patients). Of the outbreak isolates, 292 (61.3%) had an identified epidemiological link. Among the outbreaks with interventions, 95.6% showed no further transmission on the intervened transmission route. The impact analysis estimated that, over the two-year period, 62 infections were averted, with gross cost savings of $1,011,146, and net savings of $695,706, which translates to a 3.2-fold return on investment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed EDS-HAT was cost-saving and more effective in 98% of simulations.

ConclusionReal-time genomic surveillance enabled the rapid detection and control of outbreaks in our hospital and resulted in economic benefits and improvement in patient safety. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating genomic surveillance into routine infection prevention practice, offering a paradigm shift in healthcare outbreak detection and control.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

Yet, technical limitations associated with short reads challenge their use for detection of disease-associated variation in complex regions of the genome. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories.

We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including [~]90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage.

Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

Results were compared with naturally-cycling females with high E2 levels (after E2-administration, N = 16) and low E2 levels (early follicular phase, N = 16). Although pregnant females reported the lowest trait use of cognitive reappraisal, all females successfully regulated their emotions by applying cognitive reappraisal in the scanner. On the neural level, all females had increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during downregulation of negative emotions. Pregnant females showed no significant differences in functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction, resting-state) related to emotion regulation compared to the nonpregnant group. However, group differences emerged for amygdala activation. In pregnant females, increased amygdala activity predicted reduced regulation success and was positively associated with depression scores. This first fMRI study during pregnancy indicates that depression scores are reflected in heightened amygdala activity already observable in the antepartum period. Thus, through its association with reduced regulation success, increased amygdala activity suggests a neural risk marker for peripartum mental health. Future research needs to investigate emotion regulation in pregnant and postpartum women to further understand pregnancy-related changes and associations of mood, emotional and neural functions. Eventually, this will allow enhanced identification, prevention, and treatment of peri- and postpartum mental ill-health.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

These price caps may reduce revenue for the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) that negotiate the actual price paid for medicines in the US. To offset the resulting pressure on their profit margins, it is possible that PBMs would, in turn, increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines with capped prices. The model presented here evaluates how such increased out-of-pocket costs for the anticoagulants Eliquis (apixaban) and Xarelto (rivaroxaban) could impact patients financially and clinically.

MethodsCopay distributions for all 2023 prescription fills for Eliquis and Xarelto managed by the three largest PBMs were used to approximate current copay costs. Increased out-of-pocket costs were modeled as a shift of all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest copay tier. The known linear relationship between copay costs and treatment abandonment was used to calculate the potential resulting increase in treatment abandonment. Known rates of morbidity and mortality due to abandoning anticoagulants were used to estimate resulting increases in morbidity and mortality.

ResultsIf the three largest PBMs all shifted costs onto patients by moving all Eliquis and Xarelto prescriptions to the highest formulary tier, Tier 6, patients copay amount would increase by $235 to $482 million for Eliquis and $105 to $206 million for Xarelto. Such an increase could lead to 169,000 to 228,000 patients abandoning Eliquis and 71,000 to 93,000 abandoning Xarelto. The resulting morbidity and mortality could include up to an additional 145,000 major cardiovascular events and up to 97,000 more deaths.

ConclusionThe Medicare Price Negotiation Program could impact patients negatively if it causes PBMs to increase patients out-of-pocket costs for medicines. Policymakers should closely monitor changes in overall affordability, including all patient out-of-pocket expenditures, for medications in the program. Preemptive measures to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens are not placed in precarious situations leading to poorer health outcomes should be considered.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

It is used to treat multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanistic understanding of the effect of this highly effective therapy on B cells and plasma cells in the central nervous system compartment is limited.

ObjectivesThe CLADRIPLAS study examined the effect of cladribine on peripheral and intrathecal B and plasma cell biology in people with MS.

MethodsThirty-eight people with progressive MS ineligible for- or rejecting-treatment with licenced therapies were recruited and supplied a baseline lumbar puncture. Those exhibiting gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions and/or elevated neurofilament levels were offered subcutaneous cladribine (Litak(R)). Seven people were eligible; one person died before treatment, and only five completed the first year of treatment. Twenty-two ineligible people were willing to provide a repeat lumbar puncture twelve months later.

ResultsThe CLADRIPLAS study found no evidence of a difference in the odds of a positive cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band (cOCB) result between the cladribine-treated and untreated group. This is probably explained by microarray and in vitro studies, which demonstrated that plasmablasts and notably long-lived plasma cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cladribine compared to memory B cells at physiological concentrations. This was consistent with the loss of intracellular deoxycytidine kinase during antibody-secreting cell differentiation.

DiscussionCLADRIPLAS indicates that cOCB are not rapidly eliminated in most people with MS. This may be explained by the relative lack of direct cytotoxic action of cladribine on long-lived plasma cells.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

However, the systemic identification of these alleles has been challenging due to their scarcity in the general population. Here, we discovered and characterized rare coding alleles contributing to genetic dyslipidemia, a principal risk for coronary artery disease, among over a million individuals combining three large contemporary genetic datasets (the Million Veteran Program, n = 634,535, UK Biobank, n = 431,178, and the All of Us Research Program, n = 92,304) totaling 1,158,017 multi-ancestral individuals. Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations.

Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing.

This study provides resources and insights for understanding causal mechanisms, quantifying the expressivity of rare coding alleles, and identifying novel drug targets across diverse populations.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

Previously published in 2019, 57 HCM-associated genes were curated providing the first systematic evaluation of gene-disease validity. Here we report work by the ClinGen Hereditary Cardiovascular Disorders Gene Curation Expert Panel (HCVD-GCEP) to reappraise the clinical validity of previously curated and new putative HCM genes.

MethodsThe ClinGen systematic gene curation framework was used to re-classify the gene-disease relationships for HCM and related syndromic entities involving left ventricular hypertrophy. Genes previously curated were included if their classification was not definitive, and if the time since curation was >2-3 years. New genes with literature assertions for HCM were included for initial evaluation. Existing genes were curated for new inheritance patterns where evidence existed. Curations were presented on twice monthly calls, with the HCVD-GCEP composed of 29 individuals from 21 institutions across 6 countries.

ResultsThirty-one genes were re-curated and an additional 5 new potential HCM-associated genes were curated. Among the re-curated genes, 17 (55%) genes changed classification: 1 limited and 4 disputed (from no known disease relationship), 9 disputed (from limited), and 3 definitive (from moderate). Among these, 3 (10%) genes had a clinically relevant upgrade, including TNNC1, a 9th sarcomere gene with definitive HCM association. With new evidence, two genes were curated for multiple inheritance patterns (TRIM63, disputed for autosomal dominant but moderate for autosomal recessive; ALPK3, strong for autosomal dominant and definitive for recessive). CSRP3 was curated for a semi-dominant mode of inheritance (definitive). Nine (29%) genes were downgraded to disputed, further discouraging clinical reporting of variants in these genes. Five genes recently reported to cause HCM were curated: RPS6KB1 and RBM20 (limited), KLHL24 and MT-TI (moderate), and FHOD3 (definitive).

ConclusionsWe report 29 genes with definitive, strong or moderate evidence of causation for HCM or isolated LVH, including sarcomere, sarcomere-associated and syndromic conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

Herein, our goal was to map specific mucin glycoforms in diseased tissue, enabling correlation of the tumor glycan profile with malignant features. To this end, we developed a workflow implementing on-tissue digestion with mucinase StcE, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). To optimize our workflow, we analyzed four different mucinous carcinomas derived from colon, esophageal, and salivary gland tissue.

Using this technique, we deduced the spatial distribution of StcE-generated O-glycopeptides within mucinous tumors using MALDI-IMS. Subsequent LC-MS analyses revealed the identity of different species detected in imaging experiments, in addition to comprehensively characterizing the mucinome and proteome of each tissue. Our coupled MS approach unveiled a striking mucin 2 (MUC2) expression pattern in two colorectal mucinous adenocarcinomas, in which different glycoforms clearly stratified regions within the tumor. Notably, our LC-MS experiments obtained near-complete sequence coverage over the mucin domains of MUC2, enabling glycoproteomic mapping of this canonical mucin in unprecedented depth. MUC2 glycosylation was dominated by the T and Tn antigens, with surprisingly little sialylation detected. However, O-glycans containing mono- and di-O-acetylated sialic acid were detected in low abundance. Finally, we obtained spectral evidence for an endogenous O-acetylated GalNAc, an O-glycan structure not previously reported in the literature. Overall, this proof-of-concept work underscores the potential of this technique to generate new research avenues in oncology and beyond.

Significance StatementAberrant mucin expression and glycosylation are hallmarks of cancer, but how these changes promote malignant processes are not well understood. Solid tumors are highly heterogeneous in their cellular and molecular composition, and many advanced spatial techniques have emerged in recent years to study the tumor microenvironment (TME) for better understanding disease progression. Spatially resolved glycoprotein analyses typically detect either the protein or glycan components, but not both. We developed a workflow using a dual mass spectrometry approach to map the location of intact glycopeptides in mucinous tumors, enabled by on-tissue digestion with the mucin-specific protease StcE. Future applications of this method on larger patient cohorts will enhance our understanding of glycans in malignancy, identify disease biomarkers, and define therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility.

Previous research has demonstrated that targeting tissue senescence with senolytics can enhance tissue regeneration and repair by selectively eliminating SnCs in specific aged tissues. In this study, we focused on eliminating SnC skin cells in aged mice to assess the effects on subsequent wound healing. We applied ABT-263 directly to the skin of 24-month-old mice over a 5-day period. Following topical ABT-263, aged skin demonstrated decreased gene expression of senescent markers p16 and p21, accompanied by reductions in SA-{beta}-gal and p21-positive cells compared to DMSO controls. However, ABT-263 also triggered a temporary inflammatory response and macrophage infiltration in the skin. Bulk RNA sequencing of ABT-263-treated skin revealed prompt upregulation of genes associated with wound healing pathways, including hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Aged mice skin pre-treated with topical ABT-263 exhibited accelerated wound closure. In conclusion, topical ABT-263 effectively reduced several senescence markers in aged skin, thereby priming the skin for improved subsequent wound healing. This enhancement may be attributed to ABT-263-induced senolysis which in turn stimulates the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and wound repair pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.

MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.

ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

While extensive research has examined the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces, there is limited understanding of how efficiently it transfers to human skin, and how long it survives on the skin. This study investigates two key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission: (1) the transfer efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 from non-porous (plastic and metal) and porous (cardboard) surfaces to a 3D human skin model (LabSkin), and (2) the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin under different temperature conditions. First, we validated LabSkin as a suitable surrogate for human skin by comparing the transfer efficiency of the bacteriophage Phi 6 from surfaces to LabSkin and to human volunteers fingers. No significant differences were observed, confirming LabSkins suitability for these studies. Subsequently, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces to LabSkin was assessed, showing that plastic and metal surfaces had similar transfer efficiencies ([~]13%), while no transfer occurred from cardboard once the inoculum had dried on the surface. Finally, the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on skin was assessed, showing a rapid decay at higher temperatures, with a half-life ranging from 2.8 to 17.8 hours depending on the temperature.

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1727388560720

Utilizing dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and fluorescent fiber photometry, we report brain glymphatic clearance is enhanced by both sleep and anesthesia, and sharply suppressed by wakefulness. Another key finding was that less tracer enters the brains of awake animals and that brain clearance across different brain states can only be compared after adjusting for the injected tracer dose.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720

FCoV-23 is a recently emerged, highly pathogenic recombinant coronavirus responsible for a widespread outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) likely linked to in-host viral evolution. Here, we report cryoEM structures of two FCoV-23 spike (S) isoforms explaining that the in-host loss of domain 0 observed in clinical samples enhances entry into cells and fusogenicity by facilitating protease access, leading to biotype switching and lethality. We show that FCoV-23 can use several aminopeptidase N (APN) orthologs as receptors and reveal the molecular determinants of receptor species tropism, including a glycan modulating human receptor utilization. We define antigenic relationships among alphacoronaviruses infecting humans and other mammalian species and identify a cross-reactive alphacoronavirus monoclonal antibody inhibiting FCoV-23 pseudovirus entry, paving the way for vaccine and therapeutic development targeting this highly pathogenic virus.","NA","biorxiv",1727388560720
