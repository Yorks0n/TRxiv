Glycosylated biomolecules form the glycocalyx, a dense coat encasing every human cell with central relevance - among others - in immunology, oncology, and virology. In order to understand glycosylation function, visualizing its molecular structure is fundamental. However, the ability to visualize the molecular architecture of the glycocalyx has remained elusive. Techniques like mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy lack the necessary cellular context, specificity, and resolution. Here, we address these limitations by combining metabolic labeling with Angstrom-resolution fluorescence microscopy, enabling the first-ever visualization of individual sugars within glycans on the cell surface. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the molecular architecture of the glycocalyx and constitutes the foundation for future explorations of its function in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Many emerged during prehistory, coinciding with domestication providing more opportunities for spillover from original host species. However, we lack direct evidence linking past animal reservoirs and human infections. Here we present a Yersinia pestis genome recovered from a 3rd millennium BCE domesticated sheep from the Eurasian Steppe belonging to the Late Neolithic Bronze Age (LNBA) lineage, until now exclusively identified in ancient humans across Eurasia. We show that this ancient lineage underwent ancestral gene decay paralleling extant lineages, but evolved under distinct selective pressures contributing to its lack of geographic differentiation. We collect evidence supporting a scenario where the LNBA lineage, unable to efficiently transmit via fleas, spread from an unidentified reservoir to humans via sheep and likely other domesticates. Collectively, our results connect prehistoric livestock with infectious disease in humans and showcase the power of moving paleomicrobiology into the zooarcheological record.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

It is, however, well-known that TEs can also be active in the soma, although the high-confidence detection of somatic events has been challenging. Here, we leveraged the high accuracy of PacBio HiFi long reads to evaluate the somatic mobility of TEs in individuals of an A. thaliana non-reference strain lacking activity of METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1), a major component of the DNA methylation maintenance machinery. Most somatically mobile families coincided with those found in germline studies of hypomethylated genotypes, although the exact TE copies differed. We also discovered mobile elements that had been missed by standard TE annotation methods. Somatic TE activity was variable among individual plants, but also within TE families. Finally, our approach pointed to the possible involvement of alternative transposition as a cause for somatic hypermutability in a region that contains two closely spaced VANDAL21 elements. We conclude that long-read sequencing can reveal widespread TE transposition in the soma of A. thaliana hypomethylated mutants. Assessing somatic instead of germline mobilization is a fast and reliable method to investigate different aspects of TE mobility at the single plant level.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

The rapid growth of publicly available spatial data presents an opportunity to further our understanding of microenvironments that drive cell fate decisions and disease progression. However, existing foundation models, largely pretrained on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, fail to resolve the spatial relationships among samples or capture the unique distributions from various sequencing protocols. We introduce scGPT-spatial, a specialized foundation model for spatial transcriptomics continually pretrained on our previously published scGPT scRNA-seq foundation model. We also curate SpatialHuman30M, a comprehensive spatial transcriptomics dataset comprising of 30 million spatial transcriptomic profiles, encompassing both imaging- and sequencing-based protocols. To facilitate integration, scGPT-spatial introduces a novel MoE (Mixture of Experts) decoder that adaptively routes samples for protocol-aware decoding of gene expression profiles. Moreover, scGPT-spatial employs a spatially-aware sampling strategy and a novel neighborhood-based training objective to better capture spatial co-localization patterns among cell states within tissue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that scGPT-spatial robustly integrates spatial data in mulit-slide and multi-modal settings, and effectively supports cell-type deconvolution and contextualized missing gene expression imputation, outperforming many existing methods.

Despite numerous clinical observations and causality investigations, understanding of the disease's progression and recovery process following infection remains limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the causal connections between COVID-19 and various diseases using Mendelian randomization studies to provide robust theoretical underpinnings for the development of effective rehabilitation and intervention strategies. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies on Mendelian randomization related to COVID-19 published up to October 21, 2024. We used an extensive search strategy with the keywords ""Mendelian randomization"" and ""COVID-19"". Two pairs of coauthors independently extracted data on study characteristics, exposure, and outcomes, resolving discrepancies through discussion. We included studies that considered susceptibility to COVID-19, hospitalization, or severe infection as the exposure and disease-related effects or impacts on human health as outcomes. We assessed the quality of the included studies using the MR-STROBE criteria and extracted the relative risk (odds ratio [OR]) using a random-effects model for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42025615426. Results Of the 1654 studies identified, 87 met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. The primary outcome suggests that COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. Subgroup analyses identified an increased risk of neuropsychiatric disorders, including optic nerve disorders, epilepsy, schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder, stroke, myocardial infarction with COVID-19. There is also a notable association between COVID-19 and the immune system, particularly neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and myasthenia gravis. Conclusions This study demonstrates that COVID-19 infection has direct causal effects on human health or certain diseases at the genetic level, which may manifest as increased or decreased susceptibility to disease and changes in disease severity.","NA","medrxiv",1739225325868

Yet, its precise role in shaping human-wildlife pathogen exchanges remains unclear. Analysing 40 years of global wildlife trade data, we show that traded mammals are twice as likely to share pathogens with humans than non-traded species. Moreover, time spent in trade strongly predicts the number of zoonotic pathogens that wildlife species host: on average, a species shares an additional pathogen with humans for every 9 years of presence in trade. This work highlights the importance of the wildlife trade in driving animal-to-human pathogen transmission, offering key insights into pathogen biogeography in the Anthropocene and the prevention of future pandemics.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

To investigate the impact of antibiotics on phage populations, we followed 22 healthy individuals two weeks before and up to six months after a three-day course of 3rd-generation cephalosporins. The populations of phages encoded very rarely antibiotic resistance genes and were mostly temperate including many phage-plasmids. Moreover, gut phages remained individual-specific even after microbiome perturbation by antibiotics. Yet, we found a 20% decline in phage diversity and abundance, which took 30 days to recover, and a few (mostly virulent) phages burst the day after treatment. We suggest they contribute to the recovery of gut bacterial diversity, since several targeted Parabacteroides distasonis, a bacterium thriving after cephalosporin treatment, which only proliferated in the absence of these phages. Our findings point out that phages play a crucial role in the gut microbiota's response to antibiotics by restoring microbial balance and diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

The pathomechanisms underlying neurological impairments in COVID-19 and post COVID-19 condition remain incompletely understood, hence experimental studies under defined conditions, in a suitable animal model, can help to clarify the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the brain. The K18-hACE2 mouse represents such a model, as intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 VOC generally results in widespread neuronal infection with limited tissue response in the brain, consistent with a mild non-suppurative (meningo)encephalitis, with microgliosis, astrogliosis and (peri)vascular leukocyte infiltrates but no evidence of infection of vessel structures. The present study used this model to address the hypothesis that the vascular reaction is secondary to the neuronal infection. It confirmed that in intranasally challenged K18-hACE2 mice the virus targeted the neurons without overt neuropathic effect, whilst sparing the blood vessels, and further characterised the resulting inflammatory response in the brain in situ and through bulk RNA sequencing. The former highlighted the recruitment of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) via postcapillary venules, with their accumulation in the perivascular space and occasional emigration into the neuroparenchyma, without targeting and/or damage to the vessel wall. At the transcriptome level, this was accompanied by positive enrichment of pathways and the upregulation of genes involved in both the inflammatory reaction and the recruitment (including adhesion and migration) and activity of the leukocytes. We also found morphological and molecular evidence of subtle impairment of blood-brain barrier function, i.e. increased permeability. The results obtained from the model indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the neurons induces neuroinflammation, with leukocyte recruitment and activation as well as blood-brain barrier dysfunction. These data can help to understand more fully the reaction of the CNS in COVID-19 patients, and neurotropic virus infections in general.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

These parameters are generally obtained by a skilled biologist inspecting light microscope images, but this can become very laborious for high throughput applications. One way to speed up this process is by automating cell segmentation. Cell segmentation is the task of drawing a separate boundary around each individual cell in a microscope image. This task is made difficult by vague cell boundaries and the transparent nature of cells. Many techniques for automatic cell segmentation exist, but these methods often require annotated datasets, model retraining, and associated technical expertise. Results: We present SAMCell, a modified version of Metas Segment Anything Model (SAM) trained on an existing large-scale dataset of microscopy images containing varying cell types and confluency. We find that our approach works on a wide range of microscopy images, including cell types not seen in training and on images taken by a different microscope. We also present a user-friendly UI that reduces the technical expertise needed to use this automated microscopy technique. Conclusions: Using SAMCell, biologists can quickly and automatically obtain cell segmentation results of higher quality than previous methods. Further, these results can be obtained through our custom GUI without expertise in Machine Learning, thus decreasing the human labor required in cell culturing.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

For beneficial mutations, the outcome of this process may be a selective sweep, in which an allele rapidly increases in frequency and perhaps reaches fixation within a population. Selective sweeps have well-studied effects on patterns of local genetic variation in panmictic populations, but much less is known about the dynamics of sweeps in continuous space. In particular, because limited movement across a landscape leads to unique patterns of population structure, spatial dynamics may influence the trajectory of selected mutations. Here, we use forward-in-time, individual-based simulations in continuous space to study the impact of space on beneficial mutations as they sweep through a population. In particular, we show that selection changes the joint distribution of allele frequency and geographic range occupied by a focal allele and demonstrate that this signal can be used to identify selective sweeps. We then leverage this signal to identify in-progress selective sweeps within the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, a species under strong selection pressure from vector control measures. By considering space, we identify multiple previously undescribed variants with potential phenotypic consequences, including mutations impacting known IR-associated genes and altering protein structure and properties. Our results demonstrate a novel signal for detecting selection in spatial population genetic data that may have implications for genomic surveillance and understanding geographic patterns of genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides in Phtheirospermum japonicum as endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression of PjYUC3, a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through tandem multiplication and neofunctionalization. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

This change in identity was steered and maintained by the immediate microenvironment, in particular TGF-{beta}, which was locally activated by the physical interaction with nerves and integrin-mediated cleavage. Following injury, TGF-{beta} driven specification of macrophages essentially supported nerve regeneration. Overall, we identified TGF-{beta} as a central mediator governing local imprinting and long-term specialization of macrophages in the skin, providing insights into the bidirectional communication between macrophages and sensory nerves.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

While (AVR) effectors have long been considered species- or genotype-specific, based on a lack of homology in sequence databases, a growing number of studies have now shown that these proteins belong to a limited set of structural families. This is an important finding because it paves the way for the identification or engineering of broad- spectrum R proteins capable of recognizing several members of the same structural family. In the Leptosphaeria maculans / rapeseed (Brassica napus) pathosystem, 13 AVR genes have been cloned, of which four encode effectors belonging to the LARS (Leptosphaeria AviRulence and Supressing) structural family that has also been found in thirteen other phytopathogenic fungi. Homologues of the L. maculans AvrLm3 AVR protein, a LARS family member, have been identified in other fungal species, including an AVR protein from Fulvia fulva called Ecp11-1. We have previously shown that Ecp11-1 is recognized by rapeseed varieties carrying the Rlm3 R gene, and that this recognition is masked by the presence of another LARS AVR gene, AvrLm4-7. In this study, we expanded our characterization of the Rlm3 resistance spectrum to putative effectors from Fusarium oxysporum and Zymoseptoria ardabiliae and showed that one effector from F. oxysporum f. sp. narcissi behaves like Ecp11-1, being recognized by Rlm3, and this recognition also being masked by the presence of AvrLm4-7. We finally investigated which protein regions and amino acids were necessary for the recognition of AvrLm3 and Ecp11-1 by Rlm3. This analysis is a first step towards the identification or engineering of broad- spectrum R proteins that confer protection against multiple phytopathogens through the recognition of structural effector families.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

However, the basic features of dopamine release sites are still largely unknown. Here we studied the ultrastructure of fluorescent DA and glutamatergic (GLU) synaptosomes isolated from the striatum of adult mice with cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomography. We observed that DA synaptosomes display ~10 times fewer vesicles than GLU ones. DA vesicles are bigger and less round. Vesicle organization at single nanometer scale indicates that most GLU synaptosomes have tethered and primed vesicles, indicative of a readily releasable pool, while only 39 % of DA synaptosomes have tethered vesicles, which appear not to be primed. In addition, GLU terminals contacted by DA terminals in DHS have more primed vesicles than others. While DA varicosities do not form genuine synapses, their adhesion to cortico-striatal synapses may convey a local regulation of synaptic release properties.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

While maintenance of active anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) within seep carbonates has been documented, the ANME-SRB reactivity to methane exposure remains uncertain. Surface-associated microbes may metabolize AOM-derived sulfide, maintain carbonate anoxia, and contribute to carbonate dissolution and higher trophic levels; however, these microbial communities are poorly described thus far. Here we provide new insights into microbial diversity, metabolic potential, activity, and resiliency within and on Southern Californian methane seep carbonates, by combining 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequencing, laboratory incubations, and BONCAT-FISH. Ca. Methanophaga (ANME-1) dominated the carbonate interiors across different seepage activities, based on sequencing, while the dominant SRB was Ca. Desulfaltia, potentially a new ANME partner. BONCAT-FISH revealed differences in ANME-1 cell activity, suggesting cell dormancy or DNA preservation at less active seep sites. Carbonate incubations from low activity seeps ([&ge;]24 months) showed an exponential AOM reactivation (44-day doubling time), suggesting seep carbonates remain potential methane sinks over dynamic seepage conditions. The surface-associated communities were distinct from the carbonate interior and other seep habitats, and highly heterogeneous. Surface ANME-SRB biofilms and sulfide-oxidizing bacterial mats were associated with high and intermediate AOM carbonates, potentially influencing carbonate precipitation/dissolution. Carbonate surfaces shared diverse aerobic methanotrophs with invertebrates, potentially serving as pool for animal epibionts. Besides particulate methane monooxygenases from aerobic methanotrophs, we found divergent forms including within a Methylophagaceae (GCA-002733105) MAG suggesting a new function within Methylophagaceae.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Yet, how cells interrogate and respond to mechanical cues remains incompletely understood. Reproducing the mechanical properties of natural tissues in vitro is a key challenge, as these tissues exhibit complex viscoelastic behaviors and undergo continuous remodeling throughout an organism's development. Here, we leverage principles of dynamic DNA nanotechnology to introduce programmable mechanical cues into a synthetic hydrogel matrix that guides and interrogates the development of embedded cells. By systematically modulating matrix stress relaxation and stiffness, we uncover two distinct timescales of mechano-sensitive processes controlling apical-basal polarity in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells: the fast timescale (1-3 min) is linked to rapid integrin-mediated signaling, while the slower process (3-9 h) is associated with cytoskeletal reinforcements. Our analysis highlights that the commonly reported matrix 'stiffness' value, often measured as the storage modulus at ~1 Hz, has limited physiological relevance. These findings prompted us to develop a novel switchable DNA crosslinker that enables dynamic changes in viscoelasticity during ongoing cell culture. This controlled matrix reconfiguration induces reversible cell polarity inversions and guides the morphogenesis of complex multicellular structures. The material platform therefore offers unprecedented control over the mechanical microenvironment, opening new avenues for advanced applications in biophysics, tissue engineering, and disease modeling.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have achieved encouraging remission rates in hematological malignancies, they demonstrated limited success in treating Glioblastoma (GBM), particularly due to high intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity. In this study, we identified a relevant and preserved target antigen, Podoplanin (PDPN), and evaluated the potential of a PDPN- and GD2-CAR T cell blend to overcome GBM heterogeneity. Methods. Target antigen screening included clinical samples, healthy tissues and cell lines, as well as publicly available RNA sequencing datasets. The anti-tumor function of CAR T cells were examined in co-culture experiments with GBM cell lines and patient-derived organoids (PDOs), and in vivo after locoregional delivery in orthotopic xenograft models. Results. The generated CAR T cells demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity against several cell lines and PDOs from multiple patients. PDPN and GD2 expression was detectable in all PDOs at varying densities and regardless of the antigenic profile, the CAR T cell blend induced significantly higher levels of apoptosis in organoids than single antigen targeting counterparts. In vivo, we observed efficient tumor regression after locoregional administration of monospecific CAR T cells. While heterogeneous orthotopic tumors eventually relapsed in these groups, blended therapy resulted in a significantly increased overall survival and even achieved cure in the majority of mice. Conclusion. This novel PDPN-/GD2-CAR T cell blend demonstrated strong efficacy in advanced preclinical models of glioblastoma. The results suggest that this approach can overcome GBM heterogeneity in clinical application and address previous limitations of single antigen CAR T cell therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Identifying these features would not only shed light on how pLMs work, but potentially uncover novel protein biology--studying the model to study the biology. Motivated by this, we train sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the residual stream of a pLM, ESM-2. By characterizing SAE features, we determine that pLMs use a combination of generic features and family-specific features to represent a protein. In addition, we demonstrate how known sequence determinants of properties such as thermostability and subcellular localization can be identified by linear probing of SAE features. For predictive features without known functional associations, we hypothesize their role in unknown mechanisms and provide visualization tools to aid their interpretation. Our study gives a better understanding of the limitations of pLMs, and demonstrates how SAE features can be used to help generate hypotheses for biological mechanisms.

The mechanism by which these drugs may assist recovery in addiction, mood disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is still not well understood. Most investigations of the effects of these drugs on brain activity have focussed on cortical resting-state networks, however the striatum is a key reward and motivation hub of the brain and aberrant striatal processing may be part of the pathophysiology of these disorders. Consequently, we investigated striatal connectivity following acute MDMA and LSD administration. Method Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data were acquired, and seed-voxel functional connectivity analyses were used with the striatum subdivided into three seed regions: the associative, limbic, and sensorimotor striatum. Within-network connectivity was measured using group mean network maps and whole-brain connectivity (seed-to-voxel) was also examined. Results Neither MDMA nor LSD significantly changed within-network connectivity of any of the three striatal seed regions. However, striatal connectivity with other brain regions was significantly altered with both MDMA and LSD. Most notably, MDMA reduced connectivity between the limbic striatum and the amygdala, while LSD increased connectivity between the associative striatum and the frontal, sensorimotor, and visual cortices. Conclusion Changes in connectivity were mostly observed outside the standard striatal networks, consistent with previous findings that psychedelics reduce network modularity or between-network segregation and increase connectivity across standard networks.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

No clear experimental design was fully reported in any article. The major problems were 1) extremely small sample sizes (<4/group) in nearly half of the articles, 2) confusion between biological repeats and technical replications, and 3) lack of correction for multiple comparisons.

Constructing a pangenome graph, however, is still a time-consuming and expensive process. A promising approach for pangenome construction consists of progressively augmenting a pangenome graph with additional high-quality assemblies. Currently, there is no approach to augment a pangenome graph using unassembled reads from newly sequenced samples that does not require to align them and genotype the new individuals. In this work we present the first assembly-free and mapping-free approach for augmenting an existing pangenome graph using unassembled long reads from an individual not already present in the pangenome. Our approach consists of finding sample specific sequences in reads using efficient indexes, clustering reads corresponding to the same novel variant(s), and then building a consensus sequence to be added to the pangenome graph for each variant separately. Using simulated reads based on Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) assemblies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for progressively augmenting the pangenome with long reads, without the need for de novo assembly or predicting genetic variants of the new sample.

However, identifying the causal function of H3K4me3 in these diverse pathways remains a challenge, and we lack the tools to manipulate it for agricultural benefit. Here we use the CRISPR-based SunTag system to direct H3K4me3 methyltransferases in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Targeting of SunTag-SDG2 activates the expression of the endogenous reporter gene, FWA. We show that SunTag-SDG2 can be employed to increase pathogen resistance by targeting the H3K4me3-dependent disease resistance gene, SNC1. Meiotic crossover recombination rates impose a limit on the speed with which new traits can be transferred to elite crop varieties. We demonstrate that targeting of SunTag-SDG2 to low recombining centromeric regions can significantly stimulate crossover formation. Finally, we reveal that the effect is not specific to SDG2 and is likely dependent on the H3K4me3 mark itself, as the orthogonal mammalian-derived H3K4me3 methyltransferase, PRDM9, produces a similar effect on gene expression with reduced off-target potential. Overall, our study supports an instructive role for H3K4me3 in transcription and meiotic recombination and opens the door to precise modulation of important agricultural traits.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

The three main classes of metals in biological systems are alkali ions (e.g. sodium and potassium), alkaline earth ions (e.g. magnesium and calcium) as well as transition metal ions (e.g. zinc or iron and many others). To date no selective predictor to localize each of these metals in a given protein structure exists. Current methods require either preselecting a specific ion (e.g MIB2, ESMBind or AlphaFold3 or a location (MIC). In this work, we describe an extension of the recently introduced Metal3D framework that was originally trained on zinc sites to predict the location of all biologically relevant classes of metal ions as well as to classify their coordination geometry. Our model is the first of its kind and even outperforms Metal3D for the prediction of the location of zinc, and generalizes well to the other metals in terms of location prediction as well as identity classification. Comparing the model to several other available tools such as MetalSiteHunter, AlphaFold3, MIC, MIB2 and MetalHawk highlights important shortcomings in these tools with respect to data bias, prediction of negative sites and selectivity.

This study aimed to characterize and quantify macrophage reservoirs in human lymph node (LN) tissues in terms of their phenotype, location, and their potential for sustained productive infection during suppressive antiretroviral therapy. We examined the topology, nature, and size of macrophage reservoirs in lymph nodes (LNs) from 45 PLWH subtype C on suppressive ART and 14 matched controls using in situ imaging and multiplexed immunofluorescence microscopy. Germinal center CD68+ macrophages harbored HIV gag-pol DNA, HIV gag-pol RNA and Gagp24 protein. Digital droplet PCR confirmed the presence of proviral reservoirs in myeloid cells within LNs. High-resolution imaging techniques revealed that infected macrophages within GCs displayed distinct morphological characteristics, featuring larger and irregular shapes. In contrast, phagocytic macrophages exhibited intracellular staining for CD4+ T cells, had regular shapes, and were predominantly found outside the GCs. Our findings provide detailed quantitative, spatial, and phenotypic characterization of macrophage reservoirs in LNs, offering a clear estimation of the extent to which macrophages contribute to persistent HIV reservoirs in these tissues. These findings establish a basis for developing targeted strategies aimed at the elimination of these reservoirs in LN tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Distinct serotypes correspond to diverse polysaccharide structures that are encoded by distinct biosynthesis gene clusters, e.g. the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) K- and O-loci encode the synthesis machinery for the capsule (K) and outer-lipopolysaccharides (O), respectively. We previously presented Kaptive and Kaptive 2, programs to identify K and O-loci directly from KpSC genome assemblies (later adapted for Acinetobacter baumannii), enabling sero-epidemiological analyses to guide vaccine and phage therapy development. However, for some KpSC genome collections, Kaptive (v[&le;]2) was unable to type a high proportion of K-loci. Here we identify the cause of this issue as assembly fragmentation, and present a new version of Kaptive (v3) to circumvent this problem, reduce processing times and simplify output interpretation.

We compared the performance of Kaptive v2 and Kaptive v3 for typing genome assemblies generated from subsampled Illumina read sets (decrements of 10x depth), for which a corresponding high quality completed genome was also available to determine the  true loci (n=549 KpSC, n=198 A. baumannii). Both versions of Kaptive showed high rates of agreement to the matched true locus among  typeable locus calls ([&ge;]96% for [&ge;]20x read depth), but Kaptive v3 was more sensitive, particularly for low depth assemblies (at <40x depth, v3 ranged 0.85-1 vs v2 0.09-0.94) and/or typing KpSC K-loci (e.g. 0.97 vs 0.82 for non-subsampled assemblies). Overall, Kaptive v3 was also associated with a higher rate of optimal outcomes i.e. loci matching those in the reference database were correctly typed and genuine novel loci were reported as untypeable (73-98% for v3 vs 7-77% for v2 for KpSC K-loci).

Kaptive v3 was >1 order of magnitude faster than Kaptive v2 making it easy to analyse thousands of assemblies on a desktop computer, facilitating broadly accessible in silico serotyping that is both accurate and sensitive. The Kaptive v3 source code is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/klebgenomics/Kaptive), and has been implemented in Kaptive Web (https://kaptive-web.erc.monash.edu).","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

We integrated analyses of organisms (via taxonomy), functions (via metabolic pathways and proteins), and community organization (via network structure and ecological assembly) to deeply characterize response mechanisms. This revealed unexpected and comprehensive microbiome stability. This resistance to change appeared bolstered by habitat-specific dispersal and community-level functional redundancy, particularly via versatile carbon generalists. Our findings challenge widespread assumptions of significant soil microbiome alteration with climate change, and reveal key genome-inferred processes that underlie microbiome stability. This suggests that future research should reorient towards critical habitat transitions.

However, PRS model training presents significant challenges for broader adoption of PRS, including limited access to computational resources, difficulties in implementing advanced PRS methods, and availability and privacy concerns over individual-level genetic data. Cloud computing provides a promising solution with centralized computing and data resources. Here we introduce PennPRS (https://pennprs.org), a scalable cloud computing platform for online PRS model training in precision medicine. We developed novel pseudo-training algorithms for multiple PRS methods and ensemble approaches, enabling model training without requiring individual-level data. These methods were rigorously validated through extensive simulations and large-scale real data analyses involving over 6,000 phenotypes across various data sources. PennPRS supports online single- and multi-ancestry PRS training with seven methods, allowing users to upload their own data or query from more than 27,000 datasets in the GWAS Catalog, submit jobs, and download trained PRS models. Additionally, we applied our pseudo-training pipeline to train PRS models for over 8,000 phenotypes and made their PRS weights publicly accessible. In summary, PennPRS provides a novel cloud computing solution to improve the accessibility of PRS applications and reduce disparities in computational resources for the global PRS research community.","NA","medrxiv",1739225325868

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the typical species used for dough making, but the evolutionary origin of strains isolated from dough is mixed.

Surprisingly, the expansion of these traditional European strains into other human-associated niches, including the human body, has been very limited. This is in stark contrast to the Mixed-origin clade commercial baking yeasts, which consists of only a few globally distributed clonal lineages that dominate the yeast market and recurrently colonize sourdoughs and human hosts. These clonal lineages consistently maintain their ploidy, unique heterozygous chromosomal rearrangements, and stable aneuploidies in addition to several diverse structural variants. In addition to the previously known diploid and tetraploid groups of commercial isolates, we describe a widely distributed stable triploid aneuploid clonal lineage. We show that company practices and global trade help the distribution of these clonal clusters and that these yeasts are characterized by their exclusively mitotic reproduction.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

However, the suitability of PCA is contingent on appropriate normalization and transformation of count data, and accurate selection of the number of principal components; improper choices can result in the loss of biological information or corruption of the signal due to excessive noise. Typical approaches to these challenges rely on heuristics that lack theoretical foundations. In this work, we present Biwhitened PCA (BiPCA), a theoretically grounded framework for rank estimation and data denoising across a wide range of omics modalities. BiPCA overcomes a fundamental difficulty with handling count noise in omics data by adaptively rescaling the rows and columns -- a rigorous procedure that standardizes the noise variances across both dimensions. Through simulations and analysis of over 100 datasets spanning seven omics modalities, we demonstrate that BiPCA reliably recovers the data rank and enhances the biological interpretability of count data. In particular, BiPCA enhances marker gene expression, preserves cell neighborhoods, and mitigates batch effects. Our results establish BiPCA as a robust and versatile framework for high-throughput count data analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

The DUTRENEO trial (EudraCT: 2017-002246-6) investigated whether an 18-gene Tumour Inflammation Signature (TIS) that can robustly identify patients who respond to ICI in multiple tumour types could stratify patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) to receive neoadjuvant ICI (durvalumab+tremelimumab) or standard cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Patients with TIS-high tumors were randomized to ICI or NAC, while patients with TIS-low tumors received NAC. A total of 73 patients were treated. Pathological complete response (pCR) rates were 38.5% (TIS-High, ICI), 30% (TIS-High, NAC), and 55% (TIS-Low, NAC) (p = 0.349), indicating that - as applied - the TIS score did not significantly enrich in responders to ICI. Post-hoc analysis showed that higher TIS thresholds improved prediction of response to ICI but excluded many responders. Multi-omics analyses of pre-treatment samples, including whole-exome sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics (Visium, Xenium), revealed that bulk RNA response signatures originated mainly from cancer cells. Spatial transcriptomics showed that ICI response was associated with proximity between cancer cells and adaptive immune cells, while resistance to NAC was linked to phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells despite low genetic diversity. The unique design of the DUTRENEO trial underscores the challenges of translating retrospective biomarkers into clinical practice and highlights the importance of spatial features in understanding tumour-immune interactions. These findings suggest that integrating spatial and multi-modal biomarkers in well-designed clinical trials could improve stratification and response prediction to select neoadjuvant therapy.","NA","medrxiv",1739225325868

These microtubules are organized uniformly in axons with their plus-end pointing away from the soma. In contrast, in the dendrites of vertebrate neurons, microtubules are of mixed polarity, but organized into bundles of uniform polarity with stable, long-lived microtubules preferentially oriented minus-end-out and dynamic microtubules oriented plus-end-out. This organization is thought to be essential for guiding selective transport into dendrites, yet how this organization is established is unclear. Here we use a combination of single molecule localization microscopy, expansion microscopy, and live-cell imaging to examine how the microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized during neuronal development of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We find that, while the youngest neurites contain microtubules of mixed polarity, stable microtubules are initially preferentially oriented plus-end-out. At this stage of development many stable microtubules are connected to the centrioles, providing an explanation for their plus-end out orientation in emerging neurites. In later stages, these microtubules are released from the centrioles and reorient by sliding between or within neurites to become progressively more minus-end-out. Moreover, prior to axon specification, we commonly observed already one or two minor neurites with an almost uniformly plus-end-out microtubule network, indicative of transient polarization. Together, our findings reveal how stable microtubules are reorganized to help establish the stereotypical microtubule networks seen in the axon and dendrites of mature vertebrate neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

At increasing distances from the source, the dwindling number of morphogen molecules is expected to constrain the useful range of morphogen gradients. We have identified a genetic circuit that counteracts this limitation in developing wings of Drosophila by boosting BMP signalling at the distal end of the gradient without amplifying the signal near the source. This circuit involves Brinker, a transcription factor that represses BMP target genes while itself being repressed by BMP signalling. We suggest that temporal averaging inherent to the production of the inverse Brk gradient contributes to the enhancement of the positional information far from the Dpp source. Despite being a core component of BMP signalling in flies, Brinker is exclusively found in insects, likely in all insect species. Genomic analysis across a wide range of insects and gene expression analysis in limb primordia of the apterygote Thermobia domestica suggests that Brinker is an insect-specific innovation that was subsequently wired into the BMP signalling network in pterygotes, perhaps to enable wing development.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Yet such functional predictions are crucial in areas like targeted cancer therapy where some drugs may only be administered if a mutation causes an increase in enzyme activity. Current approaches either leverage static Protein-Language Model (PLM) embeddings or complex multi-modal features (e.g., static PLM embeddings, structure, and evolutionary data) and either (1) fall short in accuracy or (2) involve complex data processing and pre-training. Standardized datasets and metrics for robust benchmarking would benefit model development but do not yet exist for functional effect prediction.

To address these challenges we develop ESM-Effect, an optimized PLM-based functional effect prediction framework through extensive ablation studies. ESM-Effect fine-tunes ESM2 PLM with an inductive bias regression head to achieve state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses the multi-modal state-of-the-art method PreMode, indicating redundancy of structural and evolutionary features, while training 6.7-times faster.

In addition, we develop a benchmarking framework with robust test datasets and strategies, and propose a novel metric for prediction accuracy termed relative Bin-Mean Error (rBME): rBME emphasizes prediction accuracy in challenging, non-clustered, and rare gain-of-function regions and correlates more intuitively with model performance than commonly used Spearmans rho. Finally, we demonstrate partial generalization of ESM-Effect to unseen mutational regions within the same protein, illustrating its potential in precision medicine applications. Extending this generalization across different proteins remains a promising direction for future research.

Emerging evidence reveals that SCD pathophysiology increases risk of myeloid malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction, possibly due to pathological stress on bone marrow. To investigate this further, we interrogated mice and individuals with SCD and observed extended cell cycle times, oxidative stress, DNA damage, senescence, and dysregulation of molecular programs associated with these processes in bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Human SCD HSPCs displayed poor hematopoietic potential ex vivo. SCD mice displayed a dramatic loss of transplantable bone marrow HSPCs, which was reversed upon treatment of SCD mice with the senolytic agent, ABT-263 (navitoclax). Thus, senolytics restore bone marrow function during SCD in mice and represent a novel strategy to improve bone marrow health in individuals with SCD and improve the safety of potentially curative gene therapies that utilize autologous HSPCs from individuals with SCD.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325868

Over time, lineages may expand or contract their distribution, causing turnover in population genetic composition. At individual loci, migration, drift, environmental change (among other processes) may affect allele frequencies. Museum specimens of widely distributed species offer a unique window into the genetics of understudied populations and changes over time. Here, we sequenced genomes of 130 herbarium specimens and 91 new field collections of Arabidopsis thaliana and combined these with published genomes. We sought a broader view of genomic diversity across the species, and to test if population genomic composition is changing through time. We documented extensive and previously uncharacterized diversity in a range of populations in Africa, populations that are under threat from anthropogenic climate change. Through time, we did not find dramatic changes in genomic composition of populations. Instead, we found a pattern of genetic change every 100 years of the same magnitude seen when comparing Eurasian populations that are 185 km apart, potentially due to a combination of drift and changing selection. We found only mixed signals of polygenic adaptation at phenology and physiology QTL. We did find that genes conserved across eudicots show altered levels of directional allele frequency change, potentially due to variable purifying and background selection. Our study highlights how museum specimens can reveal new dimensions of population diversity and show how wild populations are evolving in recent history.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

This is a common scenario, for example, among pharmacologically relevant membrane-bound receptors and transporters. Here, we introduce a refinement approach in which i) several initial models are generated by stochastic subsampling of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) space in AlphaFold2, ii) the resulting models are subjected to structure-based clustering, iii) density-guided molecular dynamics simulations are performed from the centroid structures, and iv) a final model is selected on the basis of both map fit and model quality. This approach improves fitting accuracy compared to single starting point scenarios for three membrane proteins (the calcitonin receptor-like receptor, L-type amino acid transporter and alanine-serine-cysteine transporter which undergo substantial conformational transitions between functional states.

The gradient formation requires that the low molecular weight morphogens slow down their diffusion by at least one order of magnitude. However, the precise slow-down of diffusion across the relevant micrometre scales has not been directly observed. Here, we develop and employ Single-Plane Illumination Microscope based spatial Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (SPIM-sFCCS) to directly measure the diffusion coefficient of the morphogen Squint in early zebrafish embryos as a function of topography and length scale. We show that Squint's diffusion coefficient changes on length scales that are commensurate with the diameter of the intercellular spaces in the embryo and that the slow-down is regulated by receptor binding. The slowdown can be reduced by either the knockdown of Activin receptor 2b, a receptor for Squint, or the overexpression of Lefty2, an inhibitor of Squint. Based on our results and supporting simulations, we propose an interstitial space-dependent transient receptor binding and diffusing mechanism to explain this slowdown, which is crucial for gradient formation and embryonic patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

TasA enables Bacillus to tightly adhere to fungal hyphae, disrupts the {beta}-glucan layer, and compromises fungal cytoskeletal integrity synergistically with fengycin, which causes cytological damage. Additionally, TasA acts as a carrier for bacillaene, amplifying its fungistatic activity. In response, B. cinerea mounts a multifaceted defense, enzymatically degrading fengycin, producing antibacterial oxylipins, and activating adaptive programs such as hyphal branching and chlamydospore formation. Our findings reveal the previously unrecognized role of ECM components in fungal suppression and the modulation of fungal adaptive responses.

By applying serine ADPribosylation-based antibody engineering technology, we have developed the first site-specific, as well as sensitive, mono ADPribosylation modular antibodies.

By combining serine poly ADPribosylated peptides as antigens, PARP1 serine mono- and poly ADPribosylation for validation, phage display and the SpyTag protein ligation systems, we developed modular antibodies that are highly specific for poly-ADP-ribosylation. SpyTag-based coupling of horseradish peroxidase at specific positions, distant from the antigen-binding region of the antibody, yields a format that simplifies immunoblotting while dramatically enhancing poly- ADP-ribosylation detection sensitivity. Additionally, the creation of synthetic immunoglobulin formats (mouse, rabbit and human) enables straighforward codetection of mono and poly ADPribosylation in cells by immunofluorescence.

An underlying commonality of autoimmune diseases is immune-mediated inflammation. Control of inflammation is achieved by steroids and disease-modifying therapies, which can result in severe side-effects. CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Treg), are essential to controlling autoimmune responses and are considered a strong therapeutic target with minimal side effects. To that end, we leveraged our identification of B cell IgD low (BDL) B cells that control Treg homeostatic levels in the mouse spleen in a GITRL-dependent manner to demonstrate that overexpression of GITRL by BDL using a B cell-specific GITRL transgene (tg) was sufficient to increase endogenous Treg numbers and attenuate the disease severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model of MS. To determine whether increased GITRL expression by BDL could be a therapeutic strategy, WT mice were transplanted with bone marrow from GITRLtg mice. After reconstitution, GITRL expression was increased on BDL, Treg numbers were significantly elevated, and EAE was dramatically attenuated. These cumulative data further demonstrate that GITRL is a functional receptor on BDL and its overexpression in B cells is a therapeutic strategy to increase endogenous Treg numbers for treating autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

BPAN is caused by de novo pathogenic variants in the WDR45 gene on the X chromosome. WDR45 gene encodes the protein WDR45/WIPI4, a known regulator of autophagy. A defective autophagy has been observed in cellular models of BPAN disease and is associated with neurological dysfunctions in WDR45 knockout (KO) mice. However, it remains unclear whether the autophagic defect directly contributes to all WDR45 loss-induced phenotypes or whether other WDR45-dependent cellular functions are involved. To investigate this, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of CG11975 (dwdr45 KO), the Drosophila homolog of WDR45. Our analysis revealed that dwdr45 KO flies display BPAN-like phenotypes, including impaired locomotor function, autophagy dysregulation and iron dyshomeostasis. Additionally, dwdr45 KO flies exhibit shorten lifespan compared to control flies. These findings demonstrate that dwdr45 KO fly is a relevant model for investigating the key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BPAN-associated phenotypes. Notably, induction of autophagy in dwdr45 KO flies partially rescued the shortened lifespan, but did not restore locomotor function. This suggests that defective autophagy contributes to some, but not all, aspects of the phenotypes resulting from loss of dwdr45 function.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

The mechanisms by which neuronal circuits discriminate and encode the source of sensory signals remain elusive. To address this, we utilized as a model the posterior lateral line system of larval zebrafish, which is used to detect water currents. This system comprises a series of mechanosensory organs called neuromasts, which are innervated by neurons from the posterior lateral line ganglion. By combining single-neuromast optogenetic stimulation with whole-brain calcium imaging, we developed a novel approach to investigate how inputs from neuromasts are processed. Upon stimulating individual neuromasts, we observed that neurons in the brain of the zebrafish show diverse selectivity properties despite a lack of topographic organization in second-order circuits. We further demonstrated that complex combinations of neuromast stimulation are represented by sparse ensembles of neurons within the medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON) and found that neuromast input can be integrated nonlinearly. Our approach offers an innovative method for spatiotemporally interrogating the zebrafish lateral line system and presents a valuable model for studying whole-brain sensory encoding.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

Little is known about the molecular basis of eukaryogenesis, but it is likely that lipids played a key role in this process. Modern eukaryotic membranes contain polycyclic triterpenoids (mainly sterols) that are essential for a variety of cellular functions, but these lipids have not been identified in archaea. The lipid composition of Asgardarchaeota including the newly described class Hodarchaeales, which share a common ancestor with eukaryotes, is unknown. Here, we investigated the potential for Asgards to produce cyclic terpenoids. Phylogenomics coupled with structural prediction revealed that Asgards lack the capacity to make sterols, yet organisms from the clades Hodarchaeales and Kariarcheales encode for divergent homologs of sterol cyclases, predicted to produce diterpenoids. We tested the functionality of these enzymes in vitro, showing that they cyclize geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to form bicyclic halimadienyl pyrophosphate. Halimadienyl lipids have previously been shown to mediate intracellular persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in host endosomes, and may function similarly Asgardarchaeota.

Visual cortex hyperexcitability has been observed consistently across different migraine subtypes. During cortical hyperexcitability events, aberrant neurotransmitter release drives heightened G-coupled receptor signaling in cortical astrocytes, which in turn release gliotransmitters and other factors with algesic properties. This study investigated whether heightened activation of cortical astrocytes Gq-coupled signaling is sufficient to drive peripheral meningeal nociceptive responses linked to the generation of migraine headaches. Using a rat model, we employed an AAV-based chemogenetic approach that allows selective activation of visual cortex astrocyte Gq-GPCR signaling. We combined this chemogenetic approach with in vivo single-unit recording of trigeminal meningeal nociceptors to assess changes in their ongoing activity and mechanosensitivity. We further used behavioral testing of migraine-like behaviors and pharmacological targeting of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), using a monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP mAb) to further assess the relevance of cortical astrocyte activation to migraine. We discovered that heightened activation of Gq-coupled signaling in visual cortex astrocytes drives persistent discharge and increased mechanosensitivity of trigeminal nociceptors innervating the meninges overlying the visual cortex. Cortical astrocytic activation also generated cephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity, reduced exploratory behavior, and anxiety-like behaviors linked to migraine headaches. Targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide signaling, implicated in migraine pathophysiology, using a monoclonal antibody effectively suppressed astrocyte-mediated meningeal nociceptor discharge and alleviated migraine-related behaviors. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for augmented visual cortex astrocyte signaling as a triggering factor sufficient to generate meningeal nociception and migraine pain and greatly expand our understanding of migraine pathophysiology.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

A powerful framework for understanding neural computation uses neural dynamics - the rules that describe the temporal evolution of neural activity - to explain how goal-directed input-output transformations occur. As dynamical rules are not directly observable, we need computational models that can infer neural dynamics from recorded neural activity. We typically validate such models using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth dynamics, but unfortunately existing synthetic datasets don not reflect fundamental features of neural computation and are thus poor proxies for neural systems. Further, the field lacks validated metrics for quantifying the accuracy of the dynamics inferred by models. The Computation-through-Dynamics Benchmark (CtDB) fills these critical gaps by providing: 1) synthetic datasets that reflect computational properties of biological neural circuits, 2) interpretable metrics for quantifying model performance, and 3) a standardized pipeline for training and evaluating models with or without known external inputs.

Analysis of spontaneous SLE-prone mice deficient in IRF7 uncovered the IRF7 role in regulating autoimmune germinal center (GC), plasma cell (PC) and autoantibody responses and disease. IRF7, however, was dispensable for foreign antigen driven GC, PC and antibody responses. Competitive bone marrow (BM) chimeras highlighted the importance of IRF7 in hematopoietic cells in spontaneous GC and PC differentiation. Single-cell-RNAseq of SLE-prone B cells indicated IRF7 mediated B cell differentiation through GC and PC fates. Mechanistic studies revealed that IRF7 promoted B cell differentiation through GC and PC fates by regulating the transcriptome, translation, and metabolism of SLE-prone B cells. Mixed BM chimeras demonstrated a requirement for B cell-intrinsic IRF7 in IgG autoantibody production but not sufficient for promoting spontaneous GC and PC responses. Altogether, we delineate previously unknown B cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms of IRF7-promoted spontaneous GC and PC responses, loss of tolerance, autoantibody production and SLE development.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

However, current analysis methods often depend on a high-quality reference genome and gene annotation. Recently, de novo assembly methods have been developed to utilise long-read data in cases where a reference genome is unavailable, such as in non-model organisms. Despite the potential of these tools, there remains a lack of benchmarking and established protocols for optimal reference-free, long-read transcriptome assembly and differential expression analysis.

Here, we comprehensively evaluate the current state-of-the-art long-read de novo transcriptome assembly tools, RATTLE, RNA-Bloom2 and isONform, and compare their performance to one of the leading short-read assemblers, Trinity. We assess various metrics, including assembly quality and computational efficiency, across a range of datasets, which include simulated data and spike-in sequin transcripts, where ground truth is known, and real data from human cell lines and pea (Pisum sativum) samples, using the reference-guided assembler Bambu to define truth. To represent contemporary analysis scenarios, the datasets cover depths from 6 million to 60 million reads, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) cDNA and direct RNA sequencing, and critically, we assessed the downstream impact of assembly choice on the detection of differential gene and transcript expression.

Our results confirm that long reads generate longer assembled transcripts than short-reads for reference-free analysis, though limitations remain compared to reference-guided approaches, and suggest scope for improved accuracy and redundancy. Of the de novo pipelines, RNA-Bloom2, coupled with Corset for transcript clustering, was the best performing in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings offer guidance when selecting the most effective strategy for long-read differential expression analysis, when a high-quality reference genome is unavailable.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

This paper evaluates the hypothesis that yeasts can reshape intrinsic individual differences in nectar traits. We address the question, Do local genotypes of the nectar yeast specialist Metschnikowia reukaufii have the ability of obfuscating intrinsic individual variation among Helleborus foetidus plants in nectar sugar concentration ? An array of paired plant-yeast genotypes mimicking a natural field situation was created in the laboratory by inoculating nectar from different plant individuals with different yeast genotypes following a factorial design. Chemical analyses of nectar sugars before and after exposure to yeasts were performed using ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography. Plant individual, yeast genotype, and their interaction all had strong, significant effects on sucrose concentration of H. foetidus nectar. Metabolic activity of yeasts abolished 79% of intrinsic variance among plants in nectar sucrose concentration, considerably reducing the opportunity for selection by pollinators on this important nectar trait. We propose that pollinator selection on nectar traits of plant x yeast combinations will supersede ""naive"" selection on plants' intrinsic nectar traits, and that nectar phenotypes found by pollinators will largely represent extended phenotypes of the yeast genotype(s) living in the nectar.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with an innovative functional Channel of Interest (fCOI) approach, we investigated the functional specialization for language processing in bilateral inferior frontal regions during early childhood. In two experiments involving adults (N=20) and toddlers (N=22, ages 2-4 years), participants completed language processing and cognitive control tasks. Results demonstrated early functional specialization in the language-selective region of left inferior frontal gyrus, which showed selective responses to linguistic content while remaining insensitive to cognitive demand manipulations in both age groups. However, language selectivity in the homologous right hemisphere region was present only in adults, suggesting continued development of language organization beyond early childhood. The MD regions showed complementary patterns, with right-hemispheric selectivity for cognitive control emerging early. These findings provide evidence for early neural specialization of language processing in the left hemisphere, while revealing ongoing development in right hemispheric organization. Our results support models of early language-specific neural circuits rather than gradual differentiation from domain-general mechanisms, while highlighting the protracted development of language organization.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

The mechanism that mediates chromosome segregation in archaea remains enigmatic, despite the centre-stage role assumed by these organisms in the discourse about the origin of eukaryotes. Previously, we identified two proteins, SegA and SegB, which form a minimalist chromosome partition machine in Sulfolobales. Here we uncover patterns and mechanisms that the SegAB system employs to link chromosome organization to genome segregation. Deletion of the genes causes growth and chromosome partition defects. SegB binds to multiple sites scattered across the chromosome, but mainly localised close to the segAB locus in most archaeal genera. The sites are predominantly intragenic and enriched in one of the two compartments into which the chromosome folds. We show that SegB coalesces into multiple foci through the nucleoid, exhibiting a biased localisation towards the cell periphery, which hints at potential tethers to the cell membrane. The short-range DNA compaction activity of SegB and long-range looping of distant sites point to a significant role for SegB in chromosome condensation that in turn enables genome segregation. Collectively, our data put forward SegAB as important players in bridging chromosome organization to genome segregation in archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

However, the broader impact of auditory stimulation on sleep physiology and memory retention is not fully understood. Here, we apply random or sham auditory stimulation during an afternoon nap in a within-subject design to investigate its effects on declarative and procedural memory consolidation and electrical brain activity during sleep. Stimulation led to a specific reduction in slow-wave sleep, a decreased slow-wave count, and impaired declarative recall that correlated with the diminished sleep depth. Furthermore, we observed altered slow-wave traveling dynamics, with stimulation resulting in shorter traveling trajectories with less reach and reduced spatial spread, particularly impacting frontal regions. Disruptions in these features correlated with memory deficits. Our findings highlight the role of dynamic slow-wave properties in declarative memory consolidation and reveal some methodological limitations for using auditory cues during sleep, given their potential to disrupt complex processing patterns.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

We report that HR and MMR are yin-yang partners in the response to genetic polymorphisms and that several budding yeast HR genes (i.e., RAD51, RAD54, ZMM) exhibit anti-MMR activities. This yin-yang relationship biases MMR in wild-type interspecies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Saccharomyces paradoxus) hybrid zygotes and intraspecies S. cerevisiae hybrid zygotes with anti-MMR mutations, resulting in excessive (rather than insufficient) interhomolog HR, including negative crossover interference, allelic conversion or even disruption.

Relative to other giant tortoises (Aldabrachelys gigantea and Chelonoidis abingdonii), we found Jonathan has gene variants in pathways associated with aging, including DNA repair and telomere regulation. Consistent with his advanced age, Jonathan has significant age-related changes in DNA methylation and methylation entropy, compared with a 5-year-old Aldabra individual. Notably, we found that low entropy regions in Jonathans methylome were enriched for genes involved in the electron transport chain. This suggests that high-fidelity transcription of these genes may be crucial for extreme longevity. With this data, we propose a model for aging, that links efficient mitochondrial energy production with nuclear maintenance of low methylation entropy.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

Reductions in body size represent a third pervasive biological response; it has garnered significantly less attention despite great ecological relevance. Theoretical frameworks-the temperature-size rule, Bergmann's rule, and James's rule-predict that warmer temperatures are associated with smaller body sizes in ectotherms. In contrast, empirical evidence concerning this pattern is mixed across both taxa and environments. In the present study, we applied computer vision techniques to historical data from two large butterfly museum collections, totaling 593 species across 10 terrestrial biomes over more than a century, in order to investigate long-term trends in butterfly body size. We measured forewing length through both manual image analyses and automated computer vision algorithms proxying body size and analyzed trends by using generalized additive models in order to consider a temporal, biome-specific pattern assessment. We have tested two hypotheses: that butterfly body size (1) declines over time, in conjunction with increasing ambient temperatures, in agreement with the temperature-size rule, and (2) its variation is more marked in warm, dry biomes. Results indicate a significant overall reduction in the body size of butterflies during the last century and that this reduction is indeed more pronounced in those biomes facing higher rises in temperature. These findings constitute large-scale evidence in support of the temperature-size rule and indicate a potential ecological impact of climate change on butterfly populations.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

MethodsPatients (n=13) with persistent symptoms following COVID-19 in 2020-2021 donated blood and sputum samples at inclusion and after one year. Symptom and physiological testing data were collected concurrently. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles were analysed longitudinally and compared to pre-pandemic DNAm data from healthy controls.

ResultsWhile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) showed no significant changes, longitudinal DNAm changes were observed in neutrophil- and macrophage-enriched fractions. The changes were significantly associated with symptoms and physiological measures. Pathway analysis showed enrichment for cellular processes involved in cardiac function.

ConclusionsWe identified longitudinal DNAm changes in lung immune cells associated with pathways linked to cardiac function. These changes correlate with symptom burden and heart and lung metrics.

While developing actin probes, we observed that the merged images of three distinct actin probes, each labeled with a different fluorescent dye (red, green and blue), enabled various F-actin architectures to be distinguished based on color. This differentiation arises from slight variations in the distribution of each actin probe, and results in a unique color combination of actin probes that reflects the relative intensities of the three fluorescent dyes.

How cerebral blood perfusion maps onto micro-, meso- and macro-scale brain structure and function is therefore a key question in neuroscience. Here we analyze pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (ASL) data from 1 305 healthy individuals in the HCP Lifespan studies (5-100 years) to reconstruct a high-resolution normative cerebral blood perfusion map. At the cellular and molecular level, cerebral blood perfusion co-localizes with granular layer IV, biological pathways for maintenance of cellular relaxation potential and mitochondrial organization, and with neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptors involved in vasomodulation. At the regional level, blood perfusion aligns with cortical arealization and is greatest in regions with high metabolic demand and resting-state functional hubs. Looking across individuals, blood perfusion is dynamic throughout the lifespan, follows microarchitectural changes in development, and maps onto individual differences in physiological changes in aging. In addition, we find that cortical atrophy in multiple neurodegenerative diseases (late-onset Alzheimers disease, TDP-43C, and dementia with Lewy bodies) is most pronounced in regions with lower perfusion, highlighting the utility of perfusion topography as an indicator of transdiagnostic vulnerability. Finally, we show that ASL-derived perfusion can be used to delineate arterial territories in a data-driven manner, providing insights into how the vascular system is linked to human brain function. Collectively, this work highlights how cerebral blood perfusion is central to, and interlinked with, multiple structural and functional systems in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869
"Drosophila larval gut transcriptome reveals a microbe-mediated intestinal tissue growth via Ecdysone during adaptive growth","10.1101/2025.02.07.637066","biorxiv",8.549999999999999,1.7,8.549999999999999,8.549999999999999,8.549999999999999,"Ramos, C.

Using Drosophila and mouse gnotobiotic models, we previously established the evolutionarily conserved influence of the intestinal microbiota and selected Lactobacilli strains on juvenile growth. Here we aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-mediated Drosophila adaptive growth. Since the intestine is the interface of host-microbe interactions, we conducted an analysis of the larval midgut transcriptome in presence or absence of an intestinal Lactobacilli strain representative of the Drosophila microbiota. Among the different biological processes identified, Ecdysone signaling has emerged as a new Lactobacilli-mediated signature. Through functional and morphometrical approaches, we show that, upon bacteria association, intestinal Ecdysone is not rate limiting for the larval systemic plastic growth but required for the adaptation of midgut growth to Lactobacilli. Our results reveal a tissue-specific contribution of the pleiotropic hormone Ecdysone in the control of midgut adaptive growth and maturation.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

Most cancer cells express two homologous isoforms (HK1 and HK2) that can each bind to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). CRISPR screens across hundreds of cancer cell lines indicate that both are dispensable for cell growth in traditional culture media. By contrast, HK2 deletion impairs cell growth in Human Plasma-Like Medium (HPLM). Here, we find that HK2 is required to maintain sufficient cytosolic (OMM-detached) HK activity under conditions that enhance HK1 binding to the OMM. Notably, OMM-detached rather than OMM-docked HK promotes aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), an enigmatic phenotype displayed by most proliferating cells. We show that several proposed theories for this phenotype cannot explain the HK2 dependence and instead find that HK2 deletion severely impairs glycolytic ATP production with little impact on total ATP yield for cells in HPLM. Our results reveal a basis for conditional HK2 essentiality and suggest that demand for compartmentalized ATP synthesis underlies the Warburg effect.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

The ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), which are essential components of the ribosome, are coded by the multi-copy ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Despite its highly conserved function, the rDNA displays substantial variation within all species analysed to date. This variation comprises both inter-individual differences in total copy number (CN) as well as inter- and intragenomic sequence variation in the form of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) across rDNA copies. Whether germline variation of rDNA sequence associates with phenotypic traits in humans is, to date, unknown. Here, using the UK Biobank whole genome sequencing data, we first derive a high confidence list of rDNA-associated SNVs and INDELs that we validate in multiple ways. Using this list, we show that specific rDNA variants associate with several human traits. In particular, traits associated with body size appear enriched in variants within the Expansion Segment 15L region in the 28S rRNA. The strength of these associations does not diminish when accounting for the total rDNA CN of each individual. Our work represents the first large-scale association analysis of human traits with germline sequence variation in the rDNA, a source of human complex trait-relevant genetic variation that has thus far been largely ignored.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

It forms extensive, reciprocal connections with sensory, hippocampal, parahippocampal, prefrontal, and thalamic areas. RSC comprises granular (gRSC) and dysgranular (dRSC) subdivisions with distinct connectivity and functions. Despite its emerging role in behaviour and its implication in memory-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, the nature of its synaptic inputs remains poorly understood. Here, we combined viral anatomical tracing, optogenetic stimulation, and patch-clamp electrophysiology to investigate inputs from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsal subiculum (dSub), and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) to gRSC and dRSC. Strikingly, all recorded RSC pyramidal neurons received ATN input, regardless of subdivision or cortical layer. Activation of ATN inputs evoked significantly larger post-synaptic responses than those from dSub or ACC, though both regions maintained substantial connectivity with RSC. While dSub projections appeared denser in gRSC, synaptic responses were larger in dRSC, albeit with lower input probability. Notably, NMDA receptor-mediated components of RSC excitatory inputs were weaker than expected, potentially explaining the reported inability to induce long-term potentiation in RSC in ex vivo neurophysiology experiments. This is the first study to characterise the synaptic properties of retrosplenial afferents. Our findings highlight the dominant influence of ATN inputs and raise important questions about how RSC's long-range connectivity supports its roles in memory and spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1739225325869

To enable a more reliable and rigorous evaluation of NPIs based on time series data, we reanalyse the data for the original official evaluation of NPIs in Germany using an ensemble of 9 competitive statistical methods for estimating the effects of NPIs and other determinants of disease spread on the effective reproduction number [R](t) and the associated error bars. A proper error analysis for time series data leads to significantly wider confidence intervals than the official evaluation. In addition to vaccination and seasonality, only few NPIs - such as restrictions in public spaces - can be confidently associated with variations in [R](t), but even then effect sizes have large uncertainties. Furthermore, due to multicollinearity in NPI activation patterns, it is difficult to distinguish potential effects of NPIs in public spaces from other interventions that came into force early, such as physical distancing. In future, NPIs should be more carefully designed and accompanied by plans for data collections to allow for a timely evaluation of benefits and harms as a basis for an effective and proportionate response.","NA","medrxiv",1739225325869
