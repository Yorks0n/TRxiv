These complexes work in concert to transfer electrons and pump protons, leading to ATP regeneration. The precise organization of these complexes in native cells is debated, notably their assembly into higher-order supercomplexes called respirasomes. Here, we use in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize the native structures and organization of several major mitochondrial complexes inside Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. ATP synthases and respiratory complexes are segregated into curved and flat crista membrane domains, respectively. Respiratory complexes I, III, and IV assemble into a single type of respirasome, from which we determined a native 5 Angstrom-resolution structure showing the binding of electron carrier cytochrome c. Combined with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction at 2.4 Angstrom resolution, we assemble a detailed model of how the respiratory complexes interact with each other inside native mitochondria.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Patient-reported outcome measures were collected at baseline, after treatment and at 3-month follow up. The primary outcome measures were the mental and physical component score (MCS/PCS) of the SF-36 questionnaire 3 months after HBOT. A clinically relevant positive or negative response was defined as an increase or decrease of [&ge;]10% in MCS and/or PCS after 3 months. Secondary outcomes included the EQ-5D, severity of complaints and ability to work. In this prospective registry of 232 long COVID patients, 65% of long term-ill patients had a clinically relevant increase in quality of life.

Locating this root is crucial for reconstructing the features of LECA, both as the endpoint of eukaryogenesis and the start-point for evolution of the myriad complex traits underpinning the diversification of living eukaryotes. However, the position of the root remains contentious due to pervasive phylogenetic artefacts stemming from inadequate evolutionary models, poor taxon sampling, and limited phylogenetic signal. Here, we estimate the root of the eToL with unprecedented resolution based on a new, much larger, dataset of mitochondrial proteins which includes all known eukaryotic supergroups. Our comprehensive analyses with state-of-the-art phylogenetic models reveal that the eukaryotic root lies between two multi-supergroup assemblages: ""Opimoda+"" and ""Diphoda+"". Compellingly, this position is consistently supported across different models and robustness analyses. Notably, groups containing ""typical excavates"" are placed on both sides of the root, suggesting the complex features of the ""excavate"" cell architecture trace back to LECA. This study is the most comprehensive phylogenetic investigation of the eukaryote root to date, shedding light on the ancestral cells from which extant eukaryotes arose and providing a crucial framework for investigating the origin and evolution of canonical eukaryotic features.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Here, we show that a gut-brain-gut circuit loop gates sugar ingestion in flies. We discovered that brain neurons regulating food ingestion, IN18, receive excitatory input from enteric sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a stomach-like food storage organ. While IN1s are persistently activated upon ingestion of sugar-rich foods, enteric motor neurons are continuously inhibited, causing the crop muscles to relax and enabling flies to consume large volumes of sugar. Our findings reveal a key interoceptive mechanism that underlies the rapid sensory monitoring and motor control of sugar ingestion within the digestive tract, optimising the diet of flies across varying metabolic states.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

However, their influence on cognitive performance across early life remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the contribution of common genome-wide and rare exonic variation to cognitive performance across childhood and adolescence primarily using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n=6,495 unrelated children). We show that the effect of common variants associated with educational attainment and cognitive performance increases as children age. Conversely, the negative effect of deleterious rare variants attenuates with age. Using trio analyses, we show that these age-related trends are driven by direct genetic effects on the individual who carries these variants. We further find that the increasing effects of common variants are stronger in individuals at the upper end of the phenotype distribution, whereas the attenuating effects of rare variants are stronger in those at the lower end. Concordant results were observed in the Millenium Cohort Study (5,920 children) and UK Biobank (101,232 adults). The effects of common and rare genetic variation on childhood cognitive performance are broadly comparable in magnitude to those of other factors such as parental educational attainment, maternal illness and preterm birth. The effects of maternal illness and preterm birth on childhood cognitive performance also attenuate with age, whereas the effect of parental educational attainment does not. Furthermore, we show that the relative contribution of these various factors differ depending on whether one considers their contribution to phenotypic variance across the entire population or to the risk of poor outcomes. Our findings may help explain the apparent incomplete penetrance of rare damaging variants associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. More generally, they also show the importance of studying dynamic genetic influences across the life course and their differential effects across the phenotype distribution.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090569

Thus, TRAIP promotes DNA inter-strand crosslink repair by triggering the disassembly of CDC45-MCM2-7-GINS (CMG) helicases that have converged on these lesions. However, disassembly of single CMGs that have stalled temporarily would be deleterious, suggesting that TRAIP must be carefully regulated. Here, we demonstrate that human cells lacking the de-ubiquitylating enzyme USP37 are hypersensitive to topoisomerase poisons and other replication stress-inducing agents. We further show that TRAIP loss rescues the hypersensitivity of USP37 knockout cells to topoisomerase inhibitors. In Xenopus egg extracts depleted of USP37, TRAIP promotes premature CMG ubiquitylation and disassembly when converging replisomes stall. Finally, guided by AlphaFold-Multimer, we discovered that binding to CDC45 mediates USP37's response to topological stress. In conclusion, we propose that USP37 protects genome stability by preventing TRAIP-dependent CMG unloading when replication stress impedes timely termination.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Ultrack employs temporal consistency to select optimal segments, ensuring robust performance even under segmentation uncertainty. We validate our method on diverse datasets, including terabyte-scale developmental time-lapses of zebrafish, fruit fly, and nematode embryos, as well as multi-color and label-free cellular imaging. We show that Ultrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cell Tracking Challenge and demonstrates superior accuracy in tracking densely packed embryonic cells over extended periods. Moreover, we propose an approach to tracking validation via dual-channel sparse labeling that enables high-fidelity ground truth generation, pushing the boundaries of long-term cell tracking assessment. Our method is freely available as a Python package with Fiji and napari plugins and can be deployed in a high-performance computing environment, facilitating widespread adoption by the research community.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Here, we show that interaction between Matrigels major component Laminin111 with epithelial alfa6beta1-integrin is crucial for this process. The outer membrane protein Invasin of Yersinia is known to activate multiple integrin-beta1 complexes, including integrin-alfa6beta1. A C-terminal integrin-binding fragment of Invasin, coated on culture plates, mediated gut epithelial cell adhesion. Addition of organoid growth factors allowed multi-passage expansion in 2D. Polarization, junction formation and generation of enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and enteroendocrine cells was stable over time. Sustained expansion of other human-, mouse-, and even snake epithelia was accomplished under comparable conditions. The 2D organoid sheet format holds advantages over the 3D in gel format in terms of imaging, accessibility of basal and apical domains and automation for high throughput screening. Invasin represents a fully defined, affordable, versatile, and animal-free complement to Matrigel/BME.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

It also provides a unique habitat for ecological microbiota. Previous research on the microbiome of pollen has largely focussed on angiosperm systems, with limited research into coniferous gymnosperms. This study characterises the pollen microbiome associated with one of the worlds most widely grown tree species, Pinus radiata. Trees were sampled from locations across Canterbury, New Zealand, with repeated collections in 2020 and 2021. Metabolomic analysis revealed the main compounds present on P. radiata pollen to be amino acids (principally proline), and carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, and sucrose). Although phenolic compounds such as {rho}-coumaric acid and catechin, and terpenoids such as dehydroabietic acid, were present at low concentrations, their strong bioactive natures mean they may be important in filtering of microbiome communities on pollen. Pinus radiata pollen was found to host a microbiome dominated by fungi; this directly contrasts with those for many angiosperm species. Geographic range and sampling years were evaluated as secondary drivers of microbiome assembly. Neither sampling location nor annual variation had a significant impact on the fungal component of the pine pollen microbiome, which was remarkably stable/conserved among samples. However, some bacterial taxa exhibited sensitivity to geographic distances and yearly variations, suggesting a secondary role for some. A core microbiome was identified in P. radiata pollen, characterized by a consistent presence of specific fungal and bacterial taxa across samples. While the dominant phyla, Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, align with findings from other pollen microbiome studies, unique core members were unidentified at genus level. This tree species-specific microbiome assembly emphasizes the crucial role of the host plant in shaping the pollen microbiome. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of pollen microbiomes in gymnosperms, shedding light on the need to look further at their ecological and functional roles.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090569

This gap is due, in part, to a lack of high-throughput methods for screening large, diverse chemical collections. Here, we leverage advances in protein adaptive differential scanning fluorimetry (paDSF) to screen the Aurora collection of 300+ fluorescent dyes against multiple synthetic tau fibril polymorphs.

Intracellular concentrations of cdG are controlled by the interplay of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes, which synthesize cdG to promote biofilms, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which hydrolyse cdG to drive motility. To track the complete regulatory logic of how V. cholerae responds to changing cdG levels, we followed a timecourse of overexpression of either the V. harveyi diguanylate cyclase QrgB or a variant of QrgB lacking catalytic activity (QrgB*). We find that QrgB increases cdG levels relative to QrgB* for 30 minutes after overexpression, but the effect of QrgB on cdG levels plateaus at 30 minutes, indicating tight adaptive control of cdG levels. In contrast, loss of VpsR, a master regulator activating biofilm formation upon binding to cdG, leads to higher baseline levels of cdG and continuously increasing cdG through 60 minutes after QrgB induction, revealing the existence of a negative feedback loop on cdG levels operating through VpsR. Through a combination of RNA polymerase ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and genetic approaches, we show that transcription of a gene encoding a PDE, cdgC, is activated by VpsR at high cdG concentrations, mediating this negative feedback on cdG levels. We further identify a transcript encoded within, and antisense to, the cdgC open reading frame which we name sRNA negative regulator of CdgC (SnrC). RNA polymerase ChIP-seq and RNA-seq demonstrate SnrC to be expressed specifically under conditions of high cdG in the absence of VpsR. Ectopic SnrC expression increases cdG levels in a manner dependent on CdgC, demonstrating that its effect on cdG levels is likely through interference with CdgC production. Further, although cells lacking cdgC exhibit enhanced biofilm formation, these mutants are outcompeted by wild type V. cholerae in colonization assays that reward a combination of attachment, dispersal, and motility behaviors. These results underscore the importance of negative feedback regulation of cdG to maintain appropriate homeostatic levels for efficient transitioning between biofilm formation and motility, both of which are necessary over the course of the V. cholerae infection cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. The hippocampal cognitive map is believed to be one such internal model. However, evidence for predictive coding and reward sensitivity in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. In fact, it raises the question of what kind of spatial representation is most useful for learning and maximizing future rewards? Here, we track the evolution of reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. Our findings reveal a highly organized restructuring of hippocampal reward representations during the learning process. Specifically, we found multiple lines of evidence, both at the population and single-cell levels, that hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward over weeks. Namely, both population-level information about reward and the percentage of reward-tuned neurons decrease over time. At the same time, the representation of the animals' choice and reward approach period (the period between choice and reward) increased over time. By tracking individual reward cells across sessions, we found that neurons initially tuned for reward shifted their tuning towards choice and reward approach periods, indicating that reward cells backpropagate their tuning to anticipate reward with experience. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, highlighting their critical role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

However, the utility of IL2 as a treatment is limited by this same pleiotropy, and protein engineering to bias specificity towards either the regulatory T cell (Treg) or CD8 T cell lineage often requires a trade-off in protein production or total bioactivity. Here we use SolubiS, a computational algorithm-based method, to predict mutations within the IL2 structure to improve protein production yield while altering cellular selectivity, to generate a mutein with elevated therapeutic potential. The design and testing process identified the V126R (murine) / V111R (human) mutation as a Treg-enhancing mutein, creating a cation repulsion to inhibit primary binding to IL2RB, with a post-IL2RA confirmational shift enabling secondary IL2RB binding, and hence allowing the trimeric receptor complex to form. In human IL2, additional N110R T151R aggregation-protecting mutations could improve protein yield of the V111R mutation. The approach also generated novel CD8 T cell-promoting mutations. Y79K created a cation-cation repulsion with IL2RA, while Q50W enhanced CD8 T cell activity through potential {pi}-stacking enhancing binding to IL2RB, with the combination highly stimulatory for CD8 T cells. For human IL2, Y65K (homolog to murine Y79K) coupled with E82K prevented IL2RA binding, however it required the aggregation-protecting mutations of N110R T151R to rescue production.

The developing conceptus (embryo and extra-embryonic membranes) secretes factors which modify the endometrium and can be critical for early pregnancy processes such maternal recognition of pregnancy (MRP) and enhancing uterine receptivity to implantation. For example, a competent bovine conceptus secretes IFNT to initiate MRP. The bovine conceptus also secretes other proteins at the time of MRP, including CAPG and PDI, which are highly conserved among placental mammals. We have previously shown that these proteins act upon the endometrium to modulate receptivity, embryo development, and implantation in species with different implantation strategies (humans and cattle). We hypothesise that developing a novel 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system will enhance our understanding of the role of conceptus-derived factors in altering the endometrium and/or ULF secretion. Here we have developed a 3D bovine endometrium on a chip system, comprising both stromal and epithelial cell culture combined with culture medium flow better mimics the in vivo endometrium and exposure to conceptus-derived factors than conventional 2D endometrial cell culture. We have demonstrated that the conceptus-derived proteins CAPG and PDI modulate the endometrial transcriptome and secretory response to promote pathways associated with early pregnancy and alter ULF composition. This work highlights the critical need for more robust and in vivo-like culture systems to study endometrial-conceptus interactions in vitro to further investigate the role of conceptus derived factors for pregnancy success.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Specific genes and molecular pathways that modulate cell differentiation speed between mammalian species remain to be determined. Here we use single-cell multi-omic analysis of neural differentiation of mouse, cynomolgus and human pluripotent cells to identify regulators for differentiation speed. We demonstrate that species-specific transcriptome dynamics are mirrored at the chromatin level, but that the speed of neural differentiation is insensitive to manipulations of cell growth and cycling. Exploiting the single-cell resolution of our data, we identify glycogen storage levels regulated by UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2) as a species-dependent trait of pluripotent cells, and show that lowered glycogen storage in UGP2 mutant cells is associated with accelerated neural differentiation.

SCRIVENER combines bacterial conjugation, in vivo DNA cutting, and in vivo homologous recombination to seamlessly stitch blocks of DNA together by mating E. coli in large arrays or pools. This workflow is simpler, cheaper, and higher throughput than current DNA assembly approaches that require DNA to be moved in and out of cells at different procedural steps. We perform over 5,000 assemblies with two to 13 DNA blocks that range from 240 bp to 8 kb and show that SCRIVENER is capable of assembling constructs as long as 23 kb at relatively high throughput and fidelity. Most SCRIVENER errors are deletions between long interspersed repeats. However, SCRIVENER can overcome these errors by enabling assembly and sequence verification at high replication at a nominal additional cost per replicate. We show that SCRIVENER can be used to build combinatorial libraries in arrays or pools, and that DNA blocks onboarded into the platform can be repurposed and reused with any other DNA block in high throughput without a PCR step. Because of these features, DNA engineering with SCRIVENER has the potential to accelerate design-build-test-learn cycles of DNA products.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

The associations we identified seemed predominantly driven by cancer, likely due to the age range of the cohort. Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis. A direction-agnostic (SKAT-O) approach additionally identified significant associations with C1orf52, TERT, IDH2, and RLIM, highlighting a link between telomerase function and longevity as well as identifying additional oncogenic genes.

This type of data is not a quantifiable resource for any kind of quantitative investigations and any manual review or structured information retrieval is time-consuming and costly. The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) mark a paradigm shift in natural language processing and offer new possibilities for structured Information Extraction (IE) from medical free text. This protocol describes a workflow for LLM based information extraction (LLM-AIx), enabling extraction of predefined entities from unstructured text using privacy preserving LLMs. By converting unstructured clinical text into structured data, LLM-AIx addresses a critical barrier in clinical research and practice, where the efficient extraction of information is essential for improving clinical decision-making, enhancing patient outcomes, and facilitating large-scale data analysis.

The protocol consists of four main processing steps: 1) Problem definition and data preparation, 2) data preprocessing, 3) LLM-based IE and 4) output evaluation. LLM-AIx allows integration on local hospital hardware without the need of transferring any patient data to external servers. As example tasks, we applied LLM-AIx for the anonymization of fictitious clinical letters from patients with pulmonary embolism. Additionally, we extracted symptoms and laterality of the pulmonary embolism of these fictitious letters. We demonstrate troubleshooting for potential problems within the pipeline with an IE on a real-world dataset, 100 pathology reports from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), for TNM stage extraction.

In Toxoplasma gondii and several other apicomplexan parasites, some glycolytic enzymes have isoforms located in their plastid (called the apicoplast). In this organelle, glycolytic intermediates like glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) are imported from the cytosol and further metabolized, providing ATP, reducing power, and precursors for anabolic pathways such as isoprenoid synthesis. However, GAP and DHAP can spontaneously convert into methylglyoxal, a toxic by-product detoxified by the glyoxalase system, typically involving Glyoxalase-1 (Glo-1) and Glyoxalase-2 (Glo-2). In T. gondii, we identified an atypical protein, TgGloL, containing a Glo-1-like motif but with limited homology to typical Glo enzymes. TgGloL localizes to the apicoplast, and its conditional knockdown impairs parasite growth, indicating its importance. While a specific and direct role for TgGloL in methylglyoxal detoxification within the apicoplast remains unclear, it is crucial for maintaining organelle homeostasis and for overall parasite fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Recent studies have shown that the aberrant transition of monomeric aS into solid-like aggregates can occur via an intermediate liquid-like state, where the protein partitions between dense and dilute phases. Although aS is not typically recognized as an RNA-binding protein, it can bind RNA under aggregation conditions. However, the impact of RNA on aS dynamics within dilute and dense phases remains unclear. Here, we employ a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy techniques to explore aS dynamics in both phases in the presence of RNA. Our sensitive analysis of the dilute phase revealed the formation of precursor nanoclusters involved in initiating phase separation. We also uncovered heterogeneity within the dense phase, discovering that aS molecules exist in two distinct mobility states: freely diffusing molecules or confined within micro-domains. Additionally, RNA was found to induce morphological changes in the dense phase. Our quantitative analysis, based on fluorescence lifetime measurements, showed that RNA alters the liquid-like properties of the aS dense phase, promoting a liquid-to-solid transition. These findings indicate the active role of RNA in modulating the material properties of aS and influencing its phase transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Evolutionary transitions between sex-chromosome systems--which change the chromosome pair that determines sex, the system of heterogamety, or both--are frequent in some clades. In others, however, sex chromosome systems show long-term stability. Previous explanations of this stasis rely on evolutionary dynamics peculiar to sex linkage, such as the accumulation of deleterious mutations on the sex-specific chromosome or sexually antagonistic mutations on either sex chromosome. Here, I show that the ordinary operation of stabilizing selection on quantitative traits can, as a by-product, promote stability of sex chromosome systems. The reason is that stabilizing selection on a trait permits individual chromosomes' genetic contributions to the trait to drift upwards or downwards, subject only to the constraint that they all sum to the trait optimum. This chromosome-specific drift causes reduced fitness in individuals with unusual chromosomal constitutions, such as the novel sexual genotypes that sex chromosome turnovers always produce. The theory can explain a suite of patterns in the phylogenetic distribution of sex determining systems. Applied to interspecific hybrids, it can also explain two key observations concerning their reduced fitness: Haldane's rule and the large-X effect.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090569

Replisome (dis)assembly is tightly coordinated with cell cycle progression to ensure genome stability. However, factors that prevent premature CMG unloading and replisome disassembly are poorly described. Since disassembly is catalyzed by ubiquitination, deubiquitinases (DUBs) represent attractive candidates for safeguarding against untimely and deleterious CMG unloading. We combined a targeted loss-of-function screen with quantitative, single-cell analysis to identify human USP37 as a key DUB preventing replisome disassembly. We demonstrate that USP37 maintains active replisomes on S-phase chromatin and promotes normal cell cycle progression. Proteomics and enzyme assays revealed USP37 interacts with the CMG complex to deubiquitinate MCM7, thus antagonizing replisome disassembly. Significantly, USP37 protects normal epithelial cells from oncoprotein-induced replication stress.

Despite these far-ranging effects, their impacts are generally underappreciated by both the public and policymakers, resulting in insufficient management and inadequate conservation outcomes. Recognizing the gap in effective quantitative measurement tools, we introduce the Extinction Potential Metric (EPM) and its derivative, EPM for Unique species (EPM-U; adjusted for phylogenetic uniqueness) to quantify the ecological damage caused by invasive alien species (IAS). These metrics estimate the number of current and projected extinct species within a 50-year horizon under a business-as-usual scenario due to specific IAS.

We applied EPM and EPM-U to assess threats to native terrestrial vertebrates from IAS, examining impacts on 2178 amphibians, 920 birds, 865 reptiles, and 473 mammals. The analysis identified that damage mostly stems from a limited number of IAS, notably two pathogenic fungi affecting amphibians (up to 380 equivalent extinct species) and primarily cats (139 equivalent extinct species) and rats (50 equivalent extinct species) impacting other groups, through mechanisms such as predation, disease, and reduced reproductive success in birds.

The proposed metrics not only provide a standardised measure of ecological impacts but are sufficiently versatile to be tailored for specific spatial and temporal scales or taxonomic groups. Furthermore, EPM could serve as a model for developing unified indicators to monitor global biodiversity targets, such as those defined in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), by assessing the ecological effects of various individual and combined anthropogenic stresses. Also, EPM and EPM-U could support the enforcement of Target 6 of the GBF, by establishing lists of IAS requiring urgent prevention and control. Thus, EPM and EPM-U offer critical tools for improving the management of biological invasions and enhancing global conservation strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

In rod-shaped bacteria, the Rod complex inserts peptidoglycan polymers into the cell wall circumferentially, generating material anisotropy that promotes anisotropic growth. Wall teichoic acids, an abundant, non-load-bearing component of the Gram-positive cell wall, are also essential for rod-shape for unknown reasons. Here, we report a direct role for wall teichoic acids in anisotropic peptidoglycan synthesis. We show that wall teichoic acids provide a cohesive cell wall substrate that is required for Rod complex activity; conversely, removing wall teichoic acids yields a porous cell wall incapable of sustaining Rod complex activity. Consistent with this, cell elongation and Rod complex motion arrest in cells depleted for wall teichoic acids, but resume following hyperosmotic shocks that contract the cell wall. We further show that cells lacking wall teichoic acids rely instead on the bifunctional peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme PBP1, whose isotropic peptidoglycan synthesis is responsible for the subsequent growth and loss of shape. Taken together, these findings reveal that the microstructure of the Gram-positive cell wall is an essential regulatory factor in its own synthesis.

SummaryThe bacterial cell wall is an essential macromolecule that encapsulates the cell and confers cell shape. Here, we reveal that an abundant yet understudied cell wall component in Gram-positive bacteria, wall teichoic acids, facilitates cell wall synthesis in the rod-shaped model organism Bacillus subtilis by conferring a physically cohesive substrate for cell wall biosynthetic enzymes. This finding explains the decades-old mystery of why cells that lack wall teichoic acids lose cell shape and grow slowly, while also highlighting an underappreciated factor impacting cell wall homeostasis: the microstructure of the wall itself.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Here, again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused or divided attention conditions. Interestingly, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: Attended stimuli serve as cues that define the context for learning. The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation.

The valproic acid (VPA) rodent model is the most widely used model for the study of idiopathic ASD, but almost all of the studies have used male rodents. Method: To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated sex differences for neuronal activity, morphology, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) signaling in primary cortical (CTX) and hippocampal (HIP) neurons prepared from rats exposed to VPA in utero. In vivo, sex-specific VPA-induced alterations in the frontal CTX transcriptome at birth were also determined. Results: Overall, VPA induced more robust changes in neuronal function and structure in the CTX than in the HIP. Male- and female-derived primary CTX neurons from rats exposed to prenatal VPA had elevated activity and showed more disorganized firing. In the HIP, only the female VPA neurons showed elevated firing, while the male VPA neurons exhibited disorganized activity. Dendritic arborization of CTX neurons from VPA rats was less complex in both sexes, though this was more pronounced in the females. Conversely, both female and male HIP neurons from VPA rats showed elevated complexity distal to the soma. Female VPA CTX neurons also had an elevated number of dendritic spines. The relative activity of the  and {beta} isoforms of GSK-3 were suppressed in both female and male VPA CTX neurons, with no changes in the HIP neurons. On postnatal day 0, alterations in CTX genes associated with neuropeptides (e.g., penk, pdyn) and receptors (e.g., drd1, adora2a) were seen in both sexes, though they were downregulated in females and upregulated in males. Limitations: Primary neuron studies may not recapitulate findings performed in vivo or at later stages of development. Conclusion: Together these findings suggest that substantial sex differences in neuronal structure and function in the VPA model may have relevance to the reported sex differences in idiopathic ASD.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Moreover, PD facilitate the transport of specific cargo that may require chaperones or carriers to be transported. The precise mechanisms underlying PD transport are not entirely understood. Parallels between PD and the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which controls transport between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, have been discussed previously. PD transport shares similar features with the phase separation dependent NPC transport. Here, bioinformatics, proteomics and imaging were used to identify proteins with similarities to phase separating nucleoporins (NUP). We identified 21 NUPs in PD fractions, and validated dual localization to NPC and PD for 6 NUPs. The transmembrane anchor NUP CPR5 localized to PD orifices as detected by high-resolution imaging. cpr5 mutants had reduced intercellular transport activity for cargo larger than 54 kDa, but not for smaller cargo around 376 Da. The data indicates a role for NUP CPR5 in macromolecular transport through PD. Together this is consistent with the recruitment of NUPs in the green lineage to form a PD pore gating complex and is in line with the idea of a phase separation as diffusion barrier at PD.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Here, we investigated wound healing in the mature leaves of Arabidopsis. We discover a novel type of wound periderm comprising a multi-layered ligno-suberized barrier covered with cuticular wax, which is formed by mesophyll cells that adopt an epidermal fate. Mesophyll cells of protective layer 1 (P1), just beneath the wound, transition into epidermal cells, which seal the wound by depositing cuticle. As P1 undergoes cell death, protective layer 2 (P2), which underlies P1, takes the place of P1 and undergoes ligno-suberization. This multi-layered periderm involves integration of ethylene and jasmonic acid signaling with ATML1, a key transcription factor in epidermal specification, to coordinate cell layer-specific functions. This novel wound periderm also occurs in the leaves of tobacco and Capsella, suggesting it is a widespread phenomenon.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enzyme resistant RNA molecules that accumulate in ageing tissues. Furthermore, circRNAs bind gDNA directly, forming circRNA:DNA complexes which can induce DNA breaks. This study investigated circRNA accumulation with gestational age in healthy and stillbirth placentae and determined whether circRNAs directly interact with placental DNA causing DNA damage.

Placenta samples (n=60 term uncomplicated; n=4 unexplained stillbirth, 23, 26, 31, 34 weeks gestation) were assessed for DNA damage using an alkaline Comet Assay. Expression levels of 6 candidate circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624 and circ_0111277), and their linear transcripts, were quantified using qPCR. Physical interaction of candidate circRNAs with DNA was confirmed by DNA:RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (DRIP). The effect of circ_0009000 knockdown in HEK293T cells was assessed following transfection with either a siRNA (designed to knockdown circ_0009000) or a scrambled siRNA control, at 5, 10 and 20 nM final concentrations using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. DNA damage was assessed by Comet Assay. Compared with earlier gestations (37, 38, 39 and 40 weeks), placental DNA damage and expression of all 6 candidate circRNAs, but not their linear transcripts, were increased in 40 and 41+ weeks gestation samples, and in stillbirth.

DRIP-qPCR signal size was significantly larger in term placentae than in enzyme-treated controls, confirming that all candidate circRNA loci bind to placental DNA.

Depletion of circ_0009000 by specific siRNA in HEK293T cells, significantly reduced DNA damage compared to control.

Stillbirth placentae show accelerated ageing with premature accumulation of candidate circRNAs (first evidence in humans) at levels consistent with older gestation tissue. Importantly, these circRNAs bind to DNA and circ_0009000 causes DNA breaks in placenta. Therefore, circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624 and circ_0111277) play a role in placental ageing and associate with stillbirth, likely via DNA damage.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Here, we investigated the contribution of rare coding variants to DDs by analyzing 13,452 individuals with DDs, 18,613 of their family members, and 3,943 controls using a combination of family-based and case/control analyses. In line with previous studies of other neuropsychiatric traits, we found a significant burden of rare (allele frequency < 1x10-5) predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) and damaging missense variants, the vast majority of which are inherited from apparently unaffected parents. These predominantly inherited burdens are strongest in DD-associated genes or those intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population, however we estimate that [~]10% of the excess of these variants in DD cases is found within the DD-associated genes, implying many more risk loci are yet to be identified. We found similar, but attenuated, burdens when comparing the unaffected parents of individuals with DDs to controls, indicating that parents have elevated risk of DDs due to these rare variants, which are overtransmitted to their affected children. We estimate that 6-8.5% of the population attributable risk for DDs are due to rare pLoF variants in those genes intolerant of pLoF variation in the general population. Finally, we apply a Bayesian framework to combine evidence from these analyses of rare, mostly-inherited variants with prior de novo mutation burden analyses to highlight an additional 25 candidate DD- associated genes for further follow up.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090570

However, many of the genes contributing to ASD-DM have yet to be delineated. In this study, we identified additional ASD-DM candidate genes with the aim to better define the genetic etiology of this subphenotype of autism. We expanded the previously studied sample size of ASD-DM individuals ten-fold by including probands from the Autism Phenome Project and Simons Simplex Collection, totaling 766 autistic individuals meeting the criteria for megalencephaly or macrocephaly and revealing 153 candidate ASD-DM genes harboring de novo protein-impacting variants. Our findings include thirteen high confidence autism genes and seven genes previously associated with DM. Five impacted genes have previously been associated with both autism and DM, including CHD8 and PTEN. By performing functional network analysis, we expanded to additional candidate genes, including one previously implicated in ASD-DM (PIK3CA) as well as 184 additional genes previously implicated in ASD or DM alone. Using zebrafish as a model, we performed CRISPR gene editing to generate knockout animals for seven of the genes and assessed head-size and induced-seizure-activity differences. From this analysis, we identified significant morphological changes in zebrafish loss-of-function of two genes, ythdf2 and ryr3. While zebrafish knockouts model haploinsufficiency of assayed genes, we identified a de novo tandem duplication impacting YTHDF2 in an ASD-DM proband. Testing zebrafish overexpressing YTHDF2 showed increased head and brain size matching that of the proband. Single-cell transcriptomes of YTHDF2 gain-of-function larvae point to reduced expression of Fragile-X-syndrome-associated FMRP-target genes globally and in the developing brain, providing insight into the mechanism underlying autistic phenotypes. We additionally discovered a variant impacting a different m6A-methylation reader, YTHDC1, in our ASD-DM cohort. Though we highlight only two cases to date, our study provides support for the m6A-RNA methylation pathway as potentially contributing to this severe form of autism.

Lay SummaryAutism (ASD) has become increasingly prevalent in children in recent years due to increasing awareness and improving diagnosis. While we know ASD is associated with hundreds of genes, there is much to learn about what genes are involved and how they contribute to its diverse presentation of traits and behaviors. By focusing on autistic individuals exhibiting enlarged brains (disproportionate megalencephaly), we identified new candidate genes possibly contributing to ASD and brain size. A autistic-patient-identified duplication of one gene in particular, YTHDF2, implicates a novel pathway related to RNA modifications with ASD and human brain size for the first time.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090570

Thousands of ATAC-seq samples have been collected that hold information about chromatin accessibility across diverse cell types and contexts, but most of these are not paired with genetic information and come from diverse distinct projects and laboratories. Results We report here joint genotyping, chromatin accessibility peak calling, and discovery of quantitative trait loci which influence chromatin accessibility (caQTLs), demonstrating the capability of performing caQTL analysis on a large scale in a diverse sample set without pre-existing genotype information. Using 10,293 profiling samples representing 1,454 unique donor individuals across 653 studies from public databases, we catalog 23,381 caQTLs in total. After joint discovery analysis, we cluster samples based on accessible chromatin profiles to identify context-specific caQTLs. We find that caQTLs are strongly enriched for annotations of gene regulatory elements across diverse cell types and tissues and are often strongly linked with genetic variation associated with changes in expression (eQTLs), indicating that caQTLs can mediate genetic effects on gene expression. We demonstrate sharing of causal variants for chromatin accessibility and diverse complex human traits, enabling a more complete picture of the genetic mechanisms underlying complex human phenotypes. Conclusions Our work provides a proof of principle for caQTL calling from previously ungenotyped samples, and represents one of the largest, most diverse caQTL resources currently available, informing mechanisms of genetic regulation of gene expression and contribution to disease.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Very few models of plant gene circuits use the absolute units required for comparison to biochemical data.

Using absolute RNA quantification, a simple model predicted abundant clock protein levels in Arabidopsis thaliana, up to 100,000 proteins per cell. NanoLUC reporter protein fusions validated the predicted levels of clock proteins in vivo. Recalibrating the detailed models to these protein levels estimated their DNA-binding dissociation constants (Kd). We estimate the same Kd from multiple results in vitro, extending the method to any promoter sequence. The detailed models simulated the Kd range estimated from LUX DNA-binding in vitro but departed from the data for CCA1 binding, pointing to further circadian mechanisms. Our analytical and experimental methods should transfer to understand other plant gene regulatory networks, potentially including the natural sequence variation that contributes to evolutionary adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during offline sleep periods. In this work, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate neural activity in the AFP during offline periods of natural sleep. We found that neurons in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) transitioned from sparse synchronous firing to asynchronous firing during sleep, which corresponded to slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, respectively. SWS periods were associated with increased spiking variability for LMAN neurons, but not for neurons in the striatal region Area X (proper name). Coinciding with the increased spiking variability, we observed that populations of LMAN neurons were co-activated at specific time points during sleep in bursting events that were characterized by a negative deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. Overall, the LMAN population bursting events were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong cross-area field coherence between LMAN and Area X, although individual LMAN-Area X LFP pairs did show coherence > 0.5. These results provide the first description of cross-area dynamics within the AFP during sleep. Furthermore, the observation of SWR-like events during sleep in LMAN suggests that large-scale population events have diverse functions across vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Once activated, they migrate towards injured sites, where they proliferate and differentiate to replenish lost or damaged cells. Although effective tissue repair relies critically on the ability of SCs to reach and populate damaged sites, mechanisms guiding SCs towards these sites are not well understood. This is largely due to the technical challenges involved in monitoring SC dynamics in real time in vivo. Here, we devised an experimental framework that allows for real-time tracking of the spatiotemporal dynamics of intestinal SCs (ISCs) during the early phases of gut regeneration. Our data show that ISC migration is rapidly induced following injury and precedes ISC divisions and differentiation. We identify the Drosophila PDGF-VEGF-related receptor, Pvr, as a critical regulator of the migratory response to epithelial damage. ISC-specific Pvr depletion strongly suppresses ISC migration towards affected sites as well as the regenerative response. We further show that the Pvr ligand, PDGF-VEGF-related factor 1 (Pvf1), is produced by the trachea/vasculature in response to intestinal damage and acts as a guidance signal to direct ISC migration towards affected areas. Our work highlights a critical role of gut-trachea/vasculature crosstalk in guiding ISC migration during regeneration. As neovascularization of injured sites is a key feature of tissue repair in both flies and mammals, these findings could be relevant to regenerative processes in a wide range of adult tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Here we demonstrate that USP37 binds the CDC45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase, which forms the stable core of the replisome and is regulated by ubiquitylation. The Pleckstrin-Homology Domain of USP37 binds CDC45 and structure-guided mutations that displace USP37 from CMG are sufficient to phenocopy loss of USP37 catalytic activity. Importantly, USP37 counteracts CMG helicase ubiquitylation by the CUL2-LRR1 ligase, which induces helicase disassembly during termination. We show that depletion of CUL2-LRR1 suppresses the sensitivity of Usp37 mutants to DNA synthesis defects and to ATR checkpoint kinase inhibitors. In contrast, mutation of the TRAIP ubiquitin ligase specifically suppresses the sensitivity of Usp37 mutants to topological stress during chromosome replication. We propose that USP37 evolved to reverse the untimely action of the two ubiquitin ligases that regulate the CMG helicase during chromosome replication in metazoa.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional continuous and pulsed stimulation protocols using Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either continuous or pulsed stimulation protocols. Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis that tVNS increases pupil size (g = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.29], BF01 = 2.5). Separating studies according to continuous vs. pulsed protocols revealed that results were driven by studies using pulsed taVNS (strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis: g = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.53], BF10 = 14.15) while continuous tVNS provided strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.01, CI = [-0.15, 0.16], BF01= 20.7).

In low mitogen, low CDK environments cells exit the cell cycle into a non-proliferative quiescent state, G0, that plays essential roles in stem cell maintenance and cellular homeostasis. CIZ1 regulates cell cycle and epigenetic programmes, and CIZ1 ablation enhances genomic instability after release from quiescence. Here, we determined the mechanisms that promote genome instability in CIZ1 ablated cells using a combination of Fucci(CA) live cell imaging, cell-free DNA replication assays and DNA combing. Cell cycle dynamics are unaffected in CIZ1-/- (CIZ1 KO) fibroblasts; however, a specific post-quiescent phenotype is observed resulting in a reduced G1 phase and cell cycle length. The reduction in G1 length in CIZ1 KO cells is associated with increased cyclin E1/E2 and A2 expression, and enhanced phosphorylation of Rb leading to early restriction point bypass. CIZ1-/- cells are deficient in cyclin A chromatin binding and required increased cyclin-CDK activity for the initiation of DNA replication, which is associated with DNA replication stress in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, the CDK threshold for initiation of DNA replication was 2-fold higher in CIZ1 KO nuclei than parental controls. Importantly, addition of recombinant CIZ1 in vitro and in vivo promotes recruitment of cyclin A to chromatin and reinstates the CDK threshold for initiation of DNA replication, reversing DNA replication stress and increasing replication fork rates. Loss of CIZ1 is associated with dysregulated cyclin-CDK signalling, resulting in reduced G1 length, an increased CDK activity threshold required to promote initiation of DNA replication that results in DNA replication stress. These data suggest that CIZ1 facilitates recruitment of cyclin-CDK complexes to chromatin and contributes to the mechanisms that determine the threshold CDK activity required for the G1/S transition in post-quiescent cells. Taken together the data support a role for CIZ1 in the prevention of DNA replication stress and maintenance of genome stability.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

One area yet to be explored involves the somatosensory system. Using a novel sensorimotor technique, this study measured the somatosensory system in retired contact sport athletes exposed to repetitive neurotrauma. Materials and Methods Retired athletes (n=85, mean age 48.6 +/- 10.6 years, all male) completed a self-report survey on their playing career, number of concussions, and continuing symptoms. Participants completed somatosensory vibrotactile tasks assessing reaction time, amplitude discrimination (sequential, simultaneous), and temporal discrimination (temporal order judgment, duration discrimination). Participants were divided between those reporting persistent symptoms (Symptomatic, n=63) and those without concerns (Nonsymptomatic, n=22). Results Symptomatic participants scored higher symptom scores compared to the Nonsymptomatic group (P<0.001). No differences were found between groups for age (P=0.152), number of concussions (P=0.193), total years played (P=0.385), or professional career length (P=0.711). Symptomatic group reaction times were slower to the Nonsymptomatic group (P<0.001). Reaction time variability were greater in the symptomatic group (P=0.002). Differences between groups were found for amplitude discrimination (sequential: P=0.031; simultaneous: P=0.036) and temporal order judgment (P=0.032). Significant correlations were found between total symptom scores and all somatosensory tasks. Correlations showed associations between total exposure years with temporal order judgement and reaction time. Conclusions. This novel study showed altered sensorimotor perception in retired athletes with persistent symptoms. Our data adds to the growing pathophysiological evidence in those who experience repetitive neurotrauma during their playing careers.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090570

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Las is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) where it colonizes the phloem tissue, resulting in substantial economic losses to citrus industry worldwide. Despite extensive efforts, effective management strategies against HLB remain elusive, necessitating a deeper understanding of the pathogen s biology. Las undergoes cell-to-cell movement through phloem flow and colonizes different tissues in which Las may have varying interactions with the host. Here, we investigate the transcriptomic landscape of Las in citrus seed coat vasculatures, enabling a complete gene expression profiling of Las genome and revealing unique transcriptomic patterns compared to previous studies using midrib tissues. Comparative transcriptomics between seed coat, midrib and ACP identified specific responses and metabolic states of Las in different host tissue. Two Las virulence factors that exhibit higher expression in seed coat can suppress callose deposition. Therefore, they may contribute to unclogging sieve plate pores during Las colonization in seed coat vasculature. Furthermore, analysis of regulatory elements uncovers a potential role of LuxR-type transcription factors in regulating Liberibacter effector gene expression during plant colonization. Together, this work provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of the devastating citrus HLB.

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Until now, the mechanism of sex determination in cephlaopods has been a mystery. Using a chromosome-level genome assembly generated with long read sequencing, we report the first evidence for genetic sex determination in cephalopods. We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Here we show that the neuronal SNARE complex proteins syntaxin and SNAP25, which enable synaptic transmission in the nervous system, inhibit the activity of the NALCN channel complex in both heterologous systems and primary neurons. The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signalling directly, and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction may offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein-containing complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

One such pathogen is the fungus Fusarium graminearum, which causes Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease on wheat and barley. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that F. graminearum expresses many candidate effector proteins during early phases of the infection process, some of which are annotated as proteases. However, the contributions of these proteases to virulence remains poorly defined. Here, we characterize a F. graminearum endopeptidase, FgTPP1 (FGSG_11164), that is highly upregulated during wheat spikelet infection and is secreted from fungal cells. To elucidate the potential role of FgTPP1 in F. graminearum virulence, we generated FgTPP1 deletion mutants ({Delta}Fgtpp1) and performed FHB infection assays. While the number of completely bleached spikes infected by F. graminearum wild-type reached 50% of total infected spikes, the number of fully bleached spikes infected by{Delta} Fgtpp1 mutants was 25%, suggesting FgTPP1 contributes to fungal virulence. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FgTPP1 revealed that FgTPP1 localizes, in part, to chloroplasts and attenuates chitin-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death induced by an autoactive disease resistance protein when expressed in planta. Notably, the FgTPP1 protein is conserved across the Ascomycota phylum, making it a core effector among ascomycete plant pathogens. These properties make FgTPP1 an ideal candidate for decoy substrate engineering, with the goal of engineering resistance to FHB, and likely other crop diseases caused by ascomycete fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Decades of work that have provided insights into pathophysiological manifestations of sucrose overfeeding have employed paradigms that rarely mimic human consumption of SSBs. Thus, our understanding of multi-organ cross-talk and molecular and/or cellular mechanisms, which operate across scales and drive physiological derangement is still poor. By employing a paradigm of sucrose water feeding in mice that closely resembles chronic SSB consumption in humans (10% sucrose in water), we have unraveled hitherto unknown tissue-specific mechanistic underpinnings, which contribute towards perturbed physiology. Our findings illustrate that systemic impaired glucose homeostasis, mediated by hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance, does not involve altered gene expression programs in the liver. We have discovered the pivotal role of the small intestine, which in conjunction with liver and muscles, drives dyshomeostasis. Importantly, we have uncovered rewiring of molecular mechanisms in the proximal intestine that is either causal or consequential to systemic ill-effects of chronic sucrose water consumption including dysfunction of liver and muscle mitochondria. Tissue-specific molecular signatures, which we have unveiled, clearly indicate that inefficient utilization of glucose is exacerbated by enhanced uptake by the gut. Besides providing systems-wide mechanistic insights, we propose that consumption of SSBs causes intestinal  molecular addiction for deregulated absorption of hexose-sugars, and drives diseases such as diabetes and obesity.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Despite their prevalence, the identity of the transporters required for distribution of these herbicides in plants is both poorly understood and the subject of controversial debate 3,4. Here we show that PIN-FORMED auxin transporters transport a range of phenoxyacetic acid herbicides across the membrane and we characterize the molecular determinants of this process using a variety of different substrates as well as protein mutagenesis to control substrate specificity.

These structures represent five key states from the transport cycle, allowing us to describe conformational changes associated with substrate binding and transport across the membrane. Overall, our results reveal that phenoxyacetic acid herbicides use the same export machinery as endogenous auxins and exemplify how transporter binding sites undergo transformations that dictate substrate specificity. These results enable development of novel synthetic auxins and for guiding precision breeding of herbicide resistant crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

This revealed broad-scale genetic structure across countries but with extensive transmission over hundreds of kilometres. We characterised variation across the transient receptor potential melastatin ion channel, TRPMPZQ, a target of praziquantel, which has recently been found to influence praziquantel susceptibility. Functional profiling of TRPMPZQ variants found in endemic populations identified four mutations that reduced channel sensitivity to praziquantel, indicating standing variation for resistance. Analysis of parasite infrapopulations sampled from individuals pre- and post-treatment identified instances of treatment failure, further indicative of potential praziquantel resistance.

To understand the evolution of NLR diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana, we leverage graph-based methods to define pangenomic NLR neighbourhoods in 17 genetically diverse genomes. We integrate full-length transcript and transposable element information to exhaustively annotate all intact and degraded NLRs, enabling exploration of the processes that underpin the birth, death and maintenance of NLR diversity within a species. Our main finding is that many uncorrelated mutational processes create NLR diversity, and that there is no single metric that captures on its own the true extent of NLR structural and sequence variation. This immense diversity in plant immune system diversification allows populations to survive the constant onslaught of pathogens, not unlike vertebrate adaptive immunity, where variation is also generated by a variety of complementary mechanisms, albeit at the level of individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

We isolated satellite cells from eel muscle tissue to establish a foundation for cultured eel meat production. While initial cell cultures contained myoblasts, continued passaging led to a decline in myoblast characteristics and an increase in fibroblast-like cells. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed significant downregulation of well-established markers for satellite cells and myoblasts, such as pax7a and myoD, over successive passages, highlighting a loss of myoblastic traits. Single-cell cloning was employed to overcome this challenge and maintain myoblast purity, leading to the successful creation of the JEM1129 cell line. These JEM1129 cells demonstrated enhanced expression of myoblast marker genes, exceeding the initial primary culture cell population. The cells showed strong myotube formation, particularly when cultured in a differentiation medium, indicating their robust potential for muscle development. The JEM1129 cell line represents a significant advancement in the cultivation of eel muscle cells, offering a promising avenue for cultured meat production. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of muscle cell biology and provide valuable insights into using fish-derived myoblasts for cultured meat production.

These factors harbour antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in Pseudomonas species (PIncs). Despite their importance, some PIncs plasmid remain underexplored at the sequence level. This study attempts to address this gap by determining the complete nucleotide sequences of several key plasmids. Using BLAST search and AlphaFold3-based protein structure prediction, we identified replication initiation proteins (RIPs) and origins of vegetative replication (oriV) for these plasmids. Notably, mini-plasmids containing these RIP and oriV sequences successfully replicated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Through pangenome analyses using the PLSDB database with the experimentally identified RIP gene reference, 2,351/59,895 plasmids were classified, and their core and accessory genes, including ARGs, were detected. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the RIPs with publicly available protein sequences enabled the grouping of existing PIncs into distinct evolutionary lineages, providing a robust framework for identifying RIPs across a broader range of previously uncharacterised plasmids. The RIPs of 8,860 plasmids in the PLSDB were newly assigned. These findings offer crucial insights into the complex landscape of plasmid-mediated ARG dissemination, marking a significant advancement in the understanding of Pseudomonas plasmids across clinical and environmental contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Unlike for small-molecule catalysts, the structural ensembles of enzymes can vary substantially with temperature, and it is in general unclear how this modulates the temperature dependence of activity. Here multi-temperature X-ray crystallography was used to record structural changes from -20{degrees}C to 40{degrees}C for a mesophilic enzyme in complex with inhibitors mimicking substrate-, intermediate-, and product-bound states, representative of major complexes underlying the kinetic constant kcat. Both inhibitors, substrates and catalytically relevant loop motifs increasingly populate catalytically competent conformations as temperature increases. These changes occur even in temperature ranges where kinetic measurements show roughly linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior where parameters characterizing the system are assumed to be temperature independent. Simple analysis shows that linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior can still be observed when the underlying activation energy / enthalpy values vary with temperature, e.g., due to structural changes, and that the underlying thermodynamic parameters can be far from values derived from Arrhenius/Eyring model fits. Our results indicate a critical role for temperature-dependent atomic-resolution structural data in interpreting temperature-dependent kinetic data from enzymatic systems.

One-Sentence SummaryStructural data spanning a 60{degrees}C temperature range for enzyme complexes mimicking the substrate-, intermediate-, and product-bound states illuminate how small temperature-dependent structural changes may modulate activity and render parameters deduced from Arrhenius/Eyring plots unreliable.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

ObjectiveThe objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity/alloimmunization potential of Helaina rhLF (effera) from K. phaffii over a 28-day period compared to bovine LF (bLF). It was hypothesized that rhLF would have an equal or lower immunogenic potential compared to bLF, which is permitted for use in conventional foods and infant formula in the EU and US.

MethodsStudy 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm, controlled trial where 66 healthy adults were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: high-dose rhLF (3.4 g/d), low-dose rhLF (0.34 g/d), or bLF (3.4 g/d) (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06012669). Participants completed a 28-day (Day 28) supplementation period followed by a 28-day washout period (Day 56) and an additional 28-day follow-up period (Day 84). Study 2 was a 12-week observational study with no intervention that enrolled 24 healthy adults. In both studies, fasting blood was obtained on Days 0, 28, 56, and 84 for analysis of anti-bLF and anti-hLF antibody levels as the primary endpoint as well as other secondary safety endpoints including complete blood count, iron biomarkers, and metabolic panel.

ResultsIn Study 1, the change from baseline to Day 56 in serum anti-bLF antibodies in the bLF group (least squares geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for the post/pre ratio: 3.01; 2.08, 4.35) was greater than the changes in serum anti-hLF antibodies in the low-dose rhLF (1.07; 0.77, 1.49; P<0.001) and high-dose rhLF (1.02; 0.62, 1.70; P<0.001) groups. In Study 2, the post/pre ratio at Day 56 in serum anti-hLF and anti-bLF antibodies were 1.00 (0.93, 1.08) and 1.01 (0.94, 1.09), respectively, confirming no change in anti-hLF antibodies in Study 1 or Study 2. Changes in all safety outcomes in Study 1 were similar between groups and within normal ranges.

ConclusionThese results support the safety and tolerability of efferaTM as a food ingredient at an intake level up to 3.4 g/d in healthy adults.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090570

Addressing this gap, we generated extensive RNA-sequencing data for multiple organs across 22 representative species over the fern phylogeny, assembling high-quality transcriptomes. These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have navigated since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

For example, p53 deficiency in some mice has been shown to rescue premature aging while others display significant aging phenotype when p53-deficient. This study seeks to elucidate, structurally and mechanistically, p53s roles in longevity. Through a relative evolutionary scoring (RES) algorithm, we quantify the level of evolutionary change in the residues of p53 across organisms of varying average lifespans in six taxonomic orders. Secondly, we used PEPPI to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53-or p53-linked proteins-and known senescence-regulating proteins across organisms in the orders Primates and Perciformes. Our RES algorithm found variations in the alignments within and across orders, suggesting that mechanisms of p53-mediated regulation of longevity may vary. PEPPI results suggest that longer-lived species may have evolved to regulate induction and inhibition of cellular senescence better than their shorter-lived counterparts. With experimental verification, these predictions could help elucidate the mechanisms of p53-mediated cellular senescence, ultimately clarifying our understanding of p53s connection to aging in a multiple-species context.

Author summaryThe p53 tumor suppressor protein protects our genome from cancers by repairing DNA damage, regulating cell death and/or pushing cells to a state where they become permanently unable to divide (known as cellular senescence). An accumulation of senescent cells produces various molecular features of aging in both mouse and human cellular models-thus linking p53 to the aging process. However, the molecular mechanism by which p53 regulates aging and its structural implications on this regulation are not clear. In this study, we assessed quantitatively the evolutionary differences in p53 sequences of organisms across several taxonomical orders to determine if there is a relationship between average lifespan and sequence evolution. In addition, we used a protein-protein interaction tool to assess the likelihood of interaction between p53, or p53-associated protein, and various senescence-associated proteins across organisms of various lifespans in two taxonomic orders: Primates and Perciformes. An elucidation of p53 structural difference and mechanistic proteomic network linked to p53 regulation of cellular senescence could advance therapeutics targeting abnormal aging.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

However, little is known about the rule that guide spatial learning in the first place. Here we recorded the paths of desert ants navigating in their natural habitat under various displacement conditions. We demonstrate that ants learn continuously the routes they travel and memorize them in one trial, without the need for reward or punishment, and even if these routes are meandering and do not lead to places of interest: a concept called  latent learning, which is typically associated with the formation of map-like representation in vertebrates. Yet, the failure of ants to solve simple artificial navigation tasks -even with the goal being clearly visible- reveals that they relied on egocentric visual memories without map-like representation of the surrounding space. Our results unveil the rules governing the formation and recall of latent memories. A model shows that it can be implemented in the insects Mushroom bodies brain area through dynamic interactions between short- and long-lasting memories.","NA","biorxiv",1725574090570

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725574090570
