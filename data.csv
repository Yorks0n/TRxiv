However, the systemic identification of these alleles has been challenging due to their scarcity in the general population. Here, we discovered and characterized rare coding alleles contributing to genetic dyslipidemia, a principal risk for coronary artery disease, among over a million individuals combining three large contemporary genetic datasets (Million Veteran Program, n = 634,535, UK Biobank, n = 431,178, and All Of Us Research Program, n = 92,304) totaling 1,158,017 multi-ancestral individuals. Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations. Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing. This study provides resources and insights for understanding causal mechanisms, quantifying the expressivity of rare coding alleles, and identifying novel drug targets across diverse populations.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157810

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157810

A transformative opportunity lies in the reciprocal exchange of genotype-to-phenotype knowledge of agricultural traits between these major crops and hundreds of locally cultivated indigenous crops, thereby enhancing the diversity and resilience of our food system. However, species-specific genetic variants and their interactions with desired natural or engineered mutations pose barriers to achieving predictable phenotypic effects, even between closely related crops or genotypes. Here, by establishing a pan-genome of the crop-rich genus Solanum and integrating functional genomics and genetics, we show that gene duplication and subsequent paralog diversification are a major obstacle to genotype-phenotype predictability. Despite broad conservation of gene macrosynteny among chromosome-scale references for 22 species, including 13 indigenous crops, hundreds of global and lineage-specific gene duplications exhibited dynamic evolutionary trajectories in paralog sequence, expression, and function, including among members of key domestication gene families. Extending our pan-genome with 10 cultivars of African eggplant and leveraging quantitative genetics and genome editing, we uncovered an intricate history of paralog emergence and evolution within this indigenous crop. The loss of an ancient redundant paralog of the classical regulator of stem cell proliferation and fruit organ number, CLAVATA3 (CLV3), was compensated by a lineage-specific tandem duplication. Subsequent pseudogenization of the derived copy followed by a cultivar-specific structural variant resulted in a single fused functional copy of CLV3 that modifies locule number alongside a newly identified gene controlling the same trait. Our findings demonstrate that paralog diversifications over short evolutionary periods are critical yet underexplored contingencies in trait evolvability and independent crop domestication histories. Unraveling these contingencies is crucial for translating genotype-to-phenotype relationships across related species.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

Previous research has demonstrated that targeting tissue senescence with senolytics can enhance tissue regeneration and repair by selectively eliminating SnCs in specific aged tissues. In this study, we focused on eliminating SnC skin cells in aged mice to assess the effects on subsequent wound healing. We applied ABT-263 directly to the skin of 24-month-old mice over a 5-day period. Following topical ABT-263, aged skin demonstrated decreased gene expression of senescent markers p16 and p21, accompanied by reductions in SA-{beta}-gal and p21-positive cells compared to DMSO controls. However, ABT-263 also triggered a temporary inflammatory response and macrophage infiltration in the skin. Bulk RNA sequencing of ABT-263-treated skin revealed prompt upregulation of genes associated with wound healing pathways, including hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, collagen synthesis, and extracellular matrix organization. Aged mice skin pre-treated with topical ABT-263 exhibited accelerated wound closure. In conclusion, topical ABT-263 effectively reduced several senescence markers in aged skin, thereby priming the skin for improved subsequent wound healing. This enhancement may be attributed to ABT-263-induced senolysis which in turn stimulates the expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and wound repair pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

These processes are crucial for cell growth, organization, function, and environmental communication. However, the mechanisms underlying efficient, fast endocytic recycling remain poorly understood. Here, by utilizing a biosensor and imaged-based screening, we uncover a novel recycling mechanism that couples endocytosis and fast recycling, which we name the clathrin-associated fast endosomal recycling pathway (CARP). Clathrin-associated tubulovesicular carriers containing clathrin, AP1, Arf1, Rab1, and Rab11, while lacking the multimeric retrieval complexes, are generated at subdomains of early endosomes, and then transported along actin to cell surfaces. Unexpectedly, the clathrin-associated recycling carriers undergo partial fusion with the plasma membrane. Subsequently, they are released from the membrane by dynamin and reenter cells. Multiple receptors utilize and modulate CARP for fast recycling following endocytosis. Thus, CARP represents a novel endocytic recycling mechanism with kiss-and-run membrane fusion.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

Whether axolotls display epigenetic hallmarks of ageing remains unknown. Here, we probe the axolotl DNA methylome throughout lifespan and present its first epigenetic clocks. Both at tissue-specific or pan-tissue levels, the clocks are biphasic, capable of predicting age during early life but not for the rest of its lifespan. We show that axolotls exhibit evolutionarily conserved features of epigenetic ageing during early life, yet their methylome is remarkably stable across lifespan, including at Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) target sites, suggesting that this species deviates from known patterns of epigenetic ageing. Lastly, we uncover structure-specific rejuvenation events upon regeneration. This study provides molecular insights into negligible senescence and furthers our understanding of the interplay between regeneration and ageing.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.

MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.

ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157810

Herein, our goal was to map specific mucin glycoforms in diseased tissue, enabling correlation of the tumor glycan profile with malignant features. To this end, we developed a workflow implementing on-tissue digestion with mucinase StcE, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). To optimize our workflow, we analyzed four different mucinous carcinomas derived from colon, esophageal, and salivary gland tissue. Using this technique, we deduced the spatial distribution of StcE-generated O-glycopeptides within mucinous tumors using MALDI-IMS. Subsequent LC-MS analyses revealed the identity of different species detected in imaging experiments, in addition to comprehensively characterizing the mucinome and proteome of each tissue. Our coupled MS approach unveiled a striking mucin 2 (MUC2) expression pattern in two colorectal mucinous adenocarcinomas, in which different glycoforms clearly stratified regions within the tumor. Notably, our LC-MS experiments obtained near-complete sequence coverage over the mucin domains of MUC2, enabling glycoproteomic mapping of this canonical mucin in unprecedented depth. MUC2 glycosylation was dominated by the T and Tn antigens, with surprisingly little sialylation detected. However, O-glycans containing mono- and di-O-acetylated sialic acid were detected in low abundance. Finally, we obtained spectral evidence for an endogenous O-acetylated GalNAc, an O-glycan structure not previously reported in the literature. Overall, this proof-of-concept work underscores the potential of this technique to generate new research avenues in oncology and beyond.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility.

Ultimately, the brain also must adopt appropriate choice behavior using reliability of these models. Here, we combined multiple experimental and computational approaches to quantify concurrent learning in monkeys performing tasks with different levels of uncertainty about the model of the environment. By comparing behavior in control monkeys and monkeys with bilateral lesions to the amygdala or ventral striatum, we found evidence for dynamic, competitive interaction between stimulus-based and action-based learning, and for a distinct role of the amygdala. Specifically, we demonstrate that the amygdala adjusts the initial balance between the two learning systems, thereby altering the interaction between arbitration and learning that shapes the time course of both learning and choice behaviors. This novel role of the amygdala can account for existing contradictory observations and provides testable predictions for future studies into circuit-level mechanisms of flexible learning and choice under uncertainty.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

We investigated whether a diverse refugee committee could utilize participatory methods to identify health priorities and a research agenda to address them.

MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study with focus groups of current and former refugees, asylum claimants and evacuees from a specialized refugee clinic over a year. We collected sociodemographic data using standardized instruments, then utilized a four-step nominal group technique process (idea generation, recording, discussion, and voting) to identify and rank participants health and research priorities. Participants ranked their top five priorities across three time periods: Pre-migration/early arrival (0-3 months), post-migration (3 months-2 years), and long-term health (>2 years). Participants created overarching priorities and corroborated findings via a member checking step.

FindingsTwenty-three participants (median age 35 years) attended one or more of five focus groups. Twenty-one completed sociodemographic surveys: 16/21 (76%) were women, representing 8 countries of origin. Participants identified ""more family physicians"" and ""improving health system navigation"" (11/60 votes each) as top health and research priorities respectively across all resettlement periods. Participants also prioritized pre-departure healthcare system orientation and improved post-arrival and long-term mental health services. Twelve participants completed the member checking process, affirming the results with minor clarifications.

InterpretationThis proof-of-concept study illustrates how refugees can use a rigorous consensus process without external influence to prioritize their healthcare needs, direct a health research agenda to address those needs, and co-produce research. These low-cost participatory methods should be replicated elsewhere.

Pathogen exposure led to an array of architectural changes including faster nest growth, increased spacing between entrances, transmission-inhibitory changes in overall nest network topology, and reduced chamber centrality.

While extensive research has examined the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces, there is limited understanding of how efficiently it transfers to human skin, and how long it survives on the skin. This study investigates two key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 transmission: (1) the transfer efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 from non-porous (plastic and metal) and porous (cardboard) surfaces to a 3D human skin model (LabSkin), and (2) the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the skin under different temperature conditions. First, we validated LabSkin as a suitable surrogate for human skin by comparing the transfer efficiency of the bacteriophage Phi 6 from surfaces to LabSkin and to human volunteers fingers. No significant differences were observed, confirming LabSkin's suitability for these studies. Subsequently, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from surfaces to LabSkin was assessed, showing that plastic and metal surfaces had similar transfer efficiencies (~13%), while no transfer occurred from cardboard once the inoculum had dried on the surface. Finally, the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on skin was assessed, showing a rapid decay at higher temperatures, with a half-life ranging from 2.8 to 17.8 hours depending on the temperature. These findings enhance our understanding of viral transmission via fomites and inform public health strategies to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through surface contact.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157810

Yet, technical limitations associated with short reads challenge their use for detection of disease-associated variation in complex regions of the genome. Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories. We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including ~90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage. Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157810

Many GxG interactions have been identified in model organisms through experimental breeding studies, but they have been difficult to identify in human populations. To address this challenge, we applied two complementary variance QTL (vQTL)-based approaches to identify GxG interactions that contribute to human blood traits and blood-related disease risk. First, we used the previously validated genome-wide scale test for each trait in ~450,000 people in the UK Biobank and identified 4 vQTLs. Genome-wide GxG interaction testing of these vQTLs enabled discovery of novel interactions between (1) CCL24 and CCL26 for eosinophil count and plasma CCL24 and CCL26 protein levels and (2) HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 for lymphocyte count and risk of celiac disease, both of which replicated in ~140,000 NIH All of Us and ~70,000 Vanderbilt BioVU participants. Second, we used a biologically informed approach to search for vQTL in disease-relevant genes. This approach identified (1) a known interaction for hemoglobin between two pathogenic variants in HFE which cause hereditary hemochromatosis and alters risk of cirrhosis and (2) a novel interaction between the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and a variant on chromosome 14 which modifies platelet count, JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis, and risk of polycythemia vera. This work identifies novel disease-relevant GxG interactions and demonstrates the utility of vQTL-based approaches in identifying GxG interactions relevant to human health at scale.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

Yet the mechanisms that allow host regulation of intracellular symbionts, a pre-requisite for stable endosymbiosis and subsequent organelle evolution, are largely unknown. Here, we describe an immune-like glycan-sensing/processing network, partly assembled through horizontal gene-transfers (HGTs), that enables Paramecium bursaria to control its green algal endosymbionts. Using phylogenetics, RNA-interference (RNAi), and metabolite exposure experiments, we show that P. bursaria regulates endosymbiont destruction using glycan-sensing/processing - a system that includes a eukaryotic-wide chitin-binding chitinase-like protein (CLP) localized to the host phago-lysosome. RNAi of CLP alters expression of eight host glycan-processing genes, including two prokaryote-derived HGTs, during endosymbiont destruction. Furthermore, glycan-sensing/processing dynamically regulates endosymbiont number in P. bursaria, plasticity crucial to maximize host fitness across ecological conditions. CLP is homologous to a human phagocyte-associated innate immune factor, revealing how immune functions can be alternatively adapted and expanded, partly through HGT, enabling endosymbiotic control.

In an open-label study the hyaluronidase bovhyaluronidase azoximer (BA) was associated with improved pulmonary function and exercise tolerance in patients with pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we evaluated the effect of BA on patients up to 12 months after COVID-19, characterized by reduced pulmonary function, dyspnea, and decreased oxygen saturation. Methods: Patients (n=392) were randomized 1:1 to receive BA (3000U) or placebo every 5 days for 71 days. Percent of predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC), respiratory symptoms, and exercise tolerance indicators were assessed at baseline and on days 71 and 180. The primary endpoint was a change from baseline in ppFVC by Day 71. Results: On Day 71, BA was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of patients with exertional desaturation (OR=0.35, p=0.0051) and dyspnea (OR=0.62, p=0.043). There were no significant intergroup differences in the ppFVC growth rate. Analysis of sub-populations revealed that by Day 180, BA was associated with increased ppFVC in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities (diff=3.31%, p=0.042) and those with earlier SARS-CoV-2 infection (diff=4.17%, p=0.021). BA was generally safe and well-tolerated. Conclusion: In patients with long-term pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19, BA was associated with increased exercise tolerance. There was evidence of shorter pulmonary function recovery time following BA in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities and those with earlier COVID-19 disease.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

As COVID-19 remains a threat, it is imperative to improve current forecasting approaches by incorporating reliable data and alternative forecasting targets to better inform decision-makers.

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a viable method to track COVID-19 transmission, offering a more reliable metric than reported cases for forecasting critical outcomes like hospitalizations. Recognizing the natural alignment of wastewater systems with city structures, ideal for leveraging WBE data, this study introduces a multi-city, wastewater-based forecasting model to categorically predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Using hospitalization and COVID-19 wastewater data for six US cities, accompanied by other epidemiological variables, we develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to generate two categorization types. The Hospitalization Capacity Risk Categorization (HCR) predicts the burden on the healthcare system based on the number of available hospital beds in a city. The Hospitalization Rate Trend (HRT) Categorization predicts the trajectory of this burden based on the growth rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Using these categorical thresholds, we create probabilistic forecasts to retrospectively predict the risk and trend category of six cities over a 20-month period for 1, 2, and 3 week forecasting windows.

We also propose a new methodology to measure forecasting model performance at change points, or time periods where sudden changes in outbreak dynamics occurred. We also explore the influence of wastewater as a predictor for hospitalizations, showing its inclusion positively impacts the models performance. With this categorical forecasting study, we are able to predict hospital capacity risk and disease trends in a novel and useful way, giving city decision-makers a new tool to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

A significant contributor to this resurgence could be drug resistance, particularly the emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin (ArtR) in Ethiopia and other regions of Eastern Africa. This situation highlights the necessity for genomic surveillance to monitor relevant drug resistance markers. This study reports sentinel site-based genomic surveillance results for P. falciparum antimalarial drug resistance mutations. From 2019 to 2022, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from febrile outpatients [&ge;]1 year of age with microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria at 12 sentinel sites across 5 regions. Molecular inversion probe (MIP) sequencing targeted mutations associated with artemisinin and partner drug resistance, including k13, mdr1, crt, dhfr, and dhps genes, along with genome-wide markers to assess the complexity of infection (COI) and parasite relatedness. A total of 1,199 falciparum-positive patients were assessed, with a median age of 20 years (IQR: 14-30) and including 463 (38.6%) females. The WHO-validated K13 R622I mutation had a high but regionally variable prevalence (15.7%, range 0-58.8%). The validated K13 A675V mutation was detected for the first time in Ethiopia in the Gambella Region (4.5%), as well as P441L and P574L mutations were detected at low frequencies in Southern and Oromia Regions, respectively. Several partner drug resistance markers were identified, with mutations in MDR1(184F), DHPS, DHFR, and CRT nearly fixed across the country. Most samples (87.2%) were monogenic infections (COI=1) and showed high genetic relatedness, particularly within the health facilities. Principal component analysis revealed regional clustering of parasites, particularly in Gambella. The prevalence of K13 R622I across the country and the presence of multiple additional ArtR markers emphasizes the urgent need for rigorous monitoring of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) efficacy to detect partner drug resistance and ACT failure early and its impact on malaria resurgence in Ethiopia.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been playing an important role by noninvasively assessing structural and functional muscular changes. This exploratory study investigated the potential of dynamic MRI during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to detect differences between healthy controls (HCs) and patients with metabolic and myotonic myopathies. The study included 14 HCs and 10 patients with confirmed muscular diseases. All individuals were scanned with 3T MRI with a protocol that included a multi-echo gradient echo sequence for fat fraction quantification, multi-echo spin-echo for water T2 relaxation time calculation, and 3D phase contrast sequences during NMES. The strain tensor, buildup and release rates were calculated from velocity datasets. Results showed that strain and strain buildup rate were reduced in the soleus muscle of patients compared to HCs, suggesting these parameters could serve as biomarkers of muscle dysfunction. Notably, there were no significant differences in fat fraction or water T2 measurements between patients and HCs, indicating that the observed changes reflect alterations in muscle contractile properties that are not reflected by structural changes. The findings provide preliminary evidence that dynamic muscle MRI during NMES can detect abnormalities in muscle contraction in patients with myotonia and metabolic myopathies, warranting further research with larger, more homogeneous patient cohorts.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

However, the majority of antibody therapeutics are not genetically human, with initial therapeutic designs typically obtained from animal models. Humanisation of these precursors is essential to reduce immunogenic risks when administered to humans. Here, we present Humatch, a computational tool designed to offer experimental-like joint humanisation of heavy and light chains in seconds. Humatch consists of three lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained to identify human heavy V-genes, light V-genes, and well-paired antibody sequences with near-perfect accuracy. We show that these CNNs, alongside germline similarity, can be used for fast humanisation that aligns well with known experimental data. Throughout the humanisation process, a sequence is guided towards a specific target gene and away from others via multiclass CNN outputs and gene-specific germline data. This guidance ensures final humanised designs do not sit `between' genes, a trait that is not naturally observed. Humatch's optimisation towards specific genes and good VH/VL pairing increases the chances that final designs will be stable and express well and reduces the chances of immunogenic epitopes forming between the two chains. Humatch's training data and source code are provided open-source.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

Menopausal hot flashes typically persist for years. For a sizeable minority of women, hot flashes are severe and substantially impairing. It is worthwhile to further investigate the genetic underpinnings of hot flashes.

MethodWe conducted the largest trans-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hot flashes available to date (N=149,560). We used self-assessment of hot flashes in the Nurses Health Study, Nurses Health Study II, Womens Health Initiative, and Queensland Institute of Medical Research samples (total n=42,489). In one sample (UK Biobank, n=107,071) direct assessment of hot flashes was not available, so menopausal hormone therapy was used as a proxy variable. We estimated the heritability of hot flashes and genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR).

ResultsIn component analyses and our trans-ancestry meta-analysis, the top locus was on chromosome 4 in the neurokinin 3 receptor gene (TACR3, position 104,556,732, trans-ancestry p=7.2x10-41). A second novel locus was identified (LINC02428, p=3.5x10-8). Gene results implicated TACR3, GRID1, NUDT4, and PHF21B. Using the hot flash GWAS meta-analysis (n=42,489; i.e., no proxy variable), SNP heritability was estimated: h2liab=.08 (h2SNP=.04, se=.02). Genetic correlations were statistically significant between hot flashes and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, rg=0.25, p=0.01), schizophrenia (rg=0.17, p=0.02), and depression (rg=0.21, p=0.01).

DiscussionThese genomic findings are consistent with independent, robust basic science research which led to a novel treatment for hot flashes, namely, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists. This new class of hot flash drugs blocks the receptor (neurokinin 3 receptor) coded for by the top locus for hot flashes (TACR3). This GWAS of hot flashes provides an uncommonly clear example of how GWAS findings can point to potent treatment targets for complex brain phenotypes. We also found that the proxy variable (menopausal hormone therapy) pointed to the same target (TACR3), and that exclusively intronic and intergenic variants signaled this target.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

However, the reliability and validity of the research derived from these records depends on the completeness and resolution of the codelists used to identify marginalised populations.

AimThe aim of this project was to develop comprehensive codelists for identifying ethnic minorities, people with learning disabilities (LD), people with severe mental illness (SMI) and people who are transgender.

Design and settingThis study was a codelist development project, conducted using primary care data from the United Kingdom.

MethodGroups of interest were defined a priori. Relevant clinical codes were identified by searching Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) publications, codelist repositories and the CPRD code browser. Relevant codelists were downloaded and merged according to marginalised group. Duplicates were removed and remaining codes reviewed by two general practitioners. Comprehensiveness was assessed in a representative CPRD population of 10,966,759 people, by comparing the frequencies of individuals identified when using the curated codelists, compared to commonly used alternatives.

ResultsA total of 52 codelists were identified. 1,420 unique codes were selected after removal of duplicates and GP review. Compared with comparator codelists, an additional 48,017 (76.6%), 52,953 (68.9%) and 508 (36.9%) people with a LD, SMI or transgender code were identified. The frequencies identified for ethnicity were consistent with expectations for the UK population.

ConclusionThe codelists curated through this project will improve inequalities research by improving standards of identifying marginalised groups in primary care data.

HOW THIS FITS INO_LIThe reliability and validity of primary care data for inequalities research depends on the comprehensiveness of the codes used to identify people from marginalised groups.

The identification and use of efficient enzymes in the applied biocatalyst is key to establishing economically feasible production processes. The generation and selection of favorable enzyme variants in adaptive laboratory evolution experiments using growth as a selection criterion is facilitated by tightly coupling enzyme catalytic activity to microbial metabolic activity. Here, we present a computational workflow to design strains that have a severe, growth-limiting metabolic chokepoint through a shared class of enzymes. The resulting chassis cell, termed enzyme selection system (ESS), is a platform for growth-coupling any enzyme from the respective enzyme class, thus offering cross-pathway application for enzyme engineering purposes. By applying the constraint-based modeling workflow, a publicly accessible database of 25,505 potential and experimentally tractable ESS designs was built for Escherichia coli and a broad range of production pathways with biotechnological relevance. Model-based analysis of the generated design database reveals a general design principle that the target enzyme activity is linked to overall microbial metabolic activity, not just the synthesis of one biomass precursor. Furthermore, the use of currently available genome-reduced strains or one preeminent carbon source does not significantly enable or improve growth-coupling of target enzymes. Most importantly, observed trade-offs between the predicted viability of ESSs, the design-inflicted metabolic perturbations, and the coupling strength suggest that a suboptimal coupling has benefits regarding the experimental implementation of ESSs and growth-coupling in general. Overall, the computed design database, which is accessible through https://biosustain.github.io/ESS-Designs/, and its analysis lay the foundation for generating valuable in vivo ESSs for a range of biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

Peptide fragments of larger proteins are particularly attractive for achieving these functions due to their inherent potential to form native-like binding interactions. Recently developed experimental approaches allow for high-throughput measurement of protein fragment inhibitory activity in living cells. However, it has thus far not been possible to predict de novo which of the many possible protein fragments bind to protein targets, let alone act as inhibitors. We have developed a computational method, FragFold, that employs AlphaFold to predict protein fragment binding to full-length proteins in a high-throughput manner. Applying FragFold to thousands of fragments tiling across diverse proteins revealed peaks of predicted binding along each protein sequence. Comparisons with experimental measurements establish that our approach is a sensitive predictor of fragment function: Evaluating inhibitory fragments from known protein-protein interaction interfaces, we find 87% are predicted by FragFold to bind in a native-like mode. Across full protein sequences, 68% of FragFold-predicted binding peaks match experimentally measured inhibitory peaks. Deep mutational scanning experiments support the predicted binding modes and uncover superior inhibitory peptides in high throughput. Further, FragFold is able to predict previously unknown protein binding modes, explaining prior genetic and biochemical data. The success rate of FragFold demonstrates that this computational approach should be broadly applicable for discovering inhibitory protein fragments across proteomes.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

These molecular networks (or interactomes) are formed progressively, each interaction influencing the next one. Accordingly, a same protein can lead to the formation of different interactomes depending on its first associated cofactor. Therefore, capturing PPIs of specific dimeric protein complexes is key for understanding the molecular rules underlying the diverse cell- and/or subcellular-functions of a bait protein of interest. Here, we introduce an innovative method called Bi-nano-ID that is based on bicolor bimolecular fluorescence complementation and the specific binding of a nanobody fused to a proximity-dependent biotinylating enzyme to tackle this issue. Bi-nano-ID was used to capture endogenous interactomes of the cytoplasmic TAZ/14-3-3e and nuclear TAZ/TEAD2 complexes, which are major downstream effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. Among the different specific interactions, we revealed the role of a particular family of protease inhibitors for stabilizing and promoting the proliferative activity of TAZ/14-3-3e complexes in mesenchymal stem cells. Overall, our work establishes a novel sensitive method for capturing and visualizing specific interactions of binary bait protein complexes in human living cells.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

Our previous work discovered a blood-based DNA methylation prognostic signature (PLAT-M8) that uses 8 CpG sites related to chemoresistance. We aim to validate this biomarker and its correlation with clinicopathological features and treatment profiles in additional cohorts. Methods: Extracted DNA from whole blood was provided from the BriTROC-1 (n=47) and OV04 cohorts (n=57) upon the first relapse. Additional samples from Hammersmith Hospital (n=100) were collected during first-line chemotherapy (cycles 3-4 and 6). Bisulphite pyrosequencing was used to quantify DNA methylation at the previously identified 8 CpG sites. The methylation data obtained were combined with previous data from ScoTROC-1D and 1V (n=141) and OCTIPS (n=46). Cox regression was used to assess overall survival (OS) after relapse concerning clinicopathological characteristics. The DNA methylation Class (Class 1 vs 2) was determined by consensus clustering. Findings: Blood DNA methylation at relapse predicts better clinical outcomes. Methylation Class shows no association with outcome during first-line chemotherapy treatment. Methylation Class 1 is associated with shorter survival, as indicated by a meta-analysis of five cohorts (OS: HR 2.54, 1.67-3.85). Class 2 patients on carboplatin monotherapy have the best prognosis, while Class 1 patients on the same treatment have the poorest prognosis (OS: aHR 9.69, 2.38-39.47). Class 1 is linked to older patients (>75 years) with advanced-stage, platinum-resistant cases, correlating with residual disease, and shorter progression-free survival. In contrast, Class 2 of PLAT-M8 is linked to platinum-sensitive patients, and higher complete response rates by RECIST criteria, but shows no correlation with CA-125. These findings emphasise the potential of PLAT-M8 in guiding second-line chemotherapy decisions. Interpretation: PLAT-M8 methylation biomarker is associated with survival in OC patients with relapse and hypothetically may predict platinum treatment response at second-line chemotherapy.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

In particular, RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 proteins are promising single-effector systems to regulate target mRNAs without altering genomic DNA, yet the current Cas13 systems are still restrained by suboptimal efficiencies. Here, we show that U1-driven CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) can dramatically increase the efficiency of various applications, including RNA knockdown and editing, without modifying the Cas13 protein effectors. We confirm that U1-driven crRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm, while conventional U6 promoter-driven crRNAs are mostly confined in the nucleus. Furthermore, we reveal that the end positions of crRNAs expressed by the U1 promoter are consistent regardless of different guide sequences and lengths. We also demonstrate that U1-driven crRNAs, but not U6-driven crRNAs, can efficiently repress the translation of target genes in combination with catalytically inactive Cas13 proteins. Finally, we show that U1-driven crRNAs can counteract the inhibitory effect of miRNAs. Our simple and effective engineering enables unprecedented cytosolic RNA-targeting applications.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

We previously developed a pooled CRISPR screening method for Drosophila melanogaster and mosquito cell lines using plasmid transfection and site-specific integration to introduce single guide (sgRNA) libraries, followed by PCR and sequencing of integrated sgRNAs. While effective, the method relies on early constitutive Cas9 activity that potentially can lead to discrepancies between genome edits and sgRNAs detected by PCR, reducing screen accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a new method to co-transfect a plasmid expressing the anti CRISPR protein AcrIIa4 to suppress Cas9 activity during early sgRNA expression, which we term IntAC (integrase with anti-CRISPR). IntAC allowed us to construct a new CRISPR screening appraoch driven by the high strength dU6:3 promoter. This new library dramatically improved precision-recall of fitness genes across the genome, retrieving 90-95% of essential gene groups within 5% error, allowing us to generate the most comprehensive list of cell fitness genes yet assembled for Drosophila. Our analysis determined that elevated sgRNA levels, made permissible by the IntAC approach, drove much of the improvement. The Drosophila fitness genes show strong correlation with human fitness genes and underscore the effects of paralogs on gene essentiality. We further demonstrate that IntAC combined with a targeted sgRNA sub library enabled precise positive selection of a transporter under solute overload. IntAC represents a straightforward enhancement to existing Drosophila CRISPR screening methods, dramatically increasing accuracy, and might also be broadly applicable to virus-free CRISPR screens in other cell types, including mosquito, lepidopteran, tick, and mammalian cells.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

To the best of our knowledge, there is no validated scale to measure this habit. Given the need to raise awareness and its importance, a study was undertaken to develop, test, and validate the HWI. The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents (PAQ-A) was adapted and substantially modified to draft the first version of the index (HWQ). The COnsensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instrument (COSMIN) guided our approach. The HWQ The questionnaire consisted of six questions with a five-point scale response for each item, ranging from the lowest [1] to the highest activity [5] as scoring criteria. We followed a four-stage procedure in validating the instrument: Stage I: items were created from the review of the relevant literature (PAQ-A, COSMIN); Stage II: the study targeted and recruited 57 health professionals from different backgrounds and vetted them as decliners, non-regulars, and regular hand washers through a scoring process.

This crucial phase ensured that the respondents had hands-on experience in handwashing in addition to their expertise. In Stage III, 10 respondents from the regular hand washers were randomly selected as expert judges. They were divided into two (2) groups (Group one and Group two) of four and six members, respectively. Further comprehensibility and comprehensiveness of the HWQ were established through a review by the four members of Group 1, and revisions were made to create HWQ-I. At stage IV, the HWQ-I was administered to the six members of the second group for ratings and content validity index calculations. The final draft of the HWI includes 4 items. Item CVI ranges between 0.8 and 1.The average scale CVI was 0.9.

The HWI demonstrated excellent content validity, showing its relevance for monitoring handwashing, and individuals can track their compliance, promoting a healthy life. We propose further studies to test the psychometric properties of the scale.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

This outbreak is still ongoing and expanding to other regions and countries. Here, we describe the epidemiological and genomic evolution of the outbreak from September 2023 to June 2024. Methods Consenting patients with mpox-like symptoms admitted to the Kamituga and the Kamanyola hospitals were recruited to the study. Samples from throat, lesions, breast milk and placenta were collected for PCR testing and sequencing. For the patients from Kamituga hospital, data on place of residence and possible exposures were collected by interviews. The location and numbers of employees were collected for all bars with sex workers. Where possible, exposures were linked to the genomic sequencing data for cluster analysis. Findings In total, 670 (suspected) mpox cases were admitted to the Kamituga hospital. There were slightly more female than male cases (351/670 [52,4%] versus 319/670, [47,6%], and cases were reported from 17 different health areas. The majority of cases were reported in Mero (205/670 [30,6%]), followed by Kimbangu (115/670 [17,2%]), Kabukungu (105/670 [16,7%]), and Asuku (73/670 [10.9%]). During this period, 7 deaths occurred and 8 out of 14 women who were pregnant had fetal loss. Three healthcare workers acquired mpox infection when caring for patients. In depth case ascertainment showed that 83,4% of patients reported recent visits to bars for (professional) sexual interactions as a likely source of infection. Whole genome sequencing resulted in the generation of 58 genome sequences. Three main clusters characterized by specific mutations were identified and several miniclusters of 2 or more sequences with over two shared mutations. No clear link between sequence cluster, bar or health area was observed. The more recent sequences from Kamanyola were related to the sequences in Kamituga and confirmed to be Clade Ib. However, relatively long branches were observed and one of the sequences clustered with publicly released sequences from travelers in Kenya, Uganda, Sweden and Thailand, indicating more undocumented ongoing spread for cluster A than for the other clusters. Most observed mutations were APOBEC-3 related mutations indicative of ongoing human-to-human transmission. Interpretation These data suggests that the rapid transmission of monkeypox virus until June 2024 was mostly related to interactions with professional sex workers (PSW) within densely populated health areas. The expanding number of cases and the recent expansion to 29 other nearby health zones of South -Kivu as well as Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya stresses the need for cross border surveillance and collaboration. Urgent enhanced response action is needed, including case finding, diagnostic capacity building, health education programmes focussing on sex workers, and possibly vaccination to limit further escalation and stop this outbreak.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

However, both blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and vascular space occupancy data (VASO) have certain limitations, such as bias towards larger cortical veins in BOLD fMRI and high specific absorption rate in VASO. This study aims to explore the feasibility of whole-brain laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping (fQSM) compared to laminar BOLD fMRI and VASO at ultra-high field. Data were acquired using 3D EPI techniques. Complex data were denoised with NORDIC and susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path-based unwrapping, the variable-kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction as well as the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithms. To assess layer-specific activation, twenty layers were segmented in the somatosensory and motor cortices, obtained from a finger tapping paradigm, and further averaged into six anatomical cortical layers. The magnitude of signal change and z-scores were compared across layers for each technique. fQSM showed the largest activation-dependent mean susceptibility decrease in Layers II/III in M1 and Layers I/ II in S1 with up to -1.3 ppb while BOLD fMRI showed the strongest mean signal increase in Layer I. Our data suggest that fQSM demonstrates less bias towards activation in superficial layers compared to BOLD fMRI. Moreover, activation-based susceptibility change was comparable to VASO data. Studying whole-brain, layer-dependent activation with submillimeter fQSM is feasible, and reduces bias towards venous drainage effects on the cortical surface compared to BOLD fMRI, thereby enabling better localization of laminar activation.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

DesignMulti-state model applied to cohort study, adjusted for vaccination, prior infection, and demographic covariates.

SettingNational Health Services (NHS) hospitals in the UK.

ParticipantsHealthcare worker cohort including 2,867 eligible people with >6 months since a previous booster who tested fortnightly for SARS-CoV-2 between October 2023 and March 2024 and completed symptoms questionnaires.

Main outcome measuresVaccine effectiveness (VE) of vaccine boosters received in October 2023 (baseline: booster >6 months prior), and durability of protection from a recent (past 6 months) previous infection (baseline: last infection >2 years prior) against mild/asymptomatic and moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild symptoms included acute respiratory symptoms for <5 days, moderate symptoms included influenza-like illness, acute respiratory symptoms for 5+ days, or sick-leave. VE and acquired protection were estimated from the multi-state model as: 1 - adjusted hazard ratio.

InterventionsReceipt of a COVID-19 bivalent original/BA.4-5 or monovalent XBB.1.5 booster during October 2023.

ResultsHalf of eligible participants (1,422) received a booster during October 2023 (280 bivalent, 1,142 monovalent) and 536 (19%) had at least one PCR-confirmed infection over the study period. For the monovalent booster, VE against infection was 44.2% (95% confidence interval 21.7 to 60.3%) at 0-2 months, and 24.1% (-0.7 to 42.9%) at 2-4 months post-vaccination, with no evidence of protection by 4-6 months. For the bivalent booster, VE against infection was 15.1% (-55.4 to 53.6%) at 0-2 months and 4.2% (-46.4 to 37.3%) at 2-4 months. VE (monovalent or bivalent) against moderate infection was 39.7% (19.9 to 54.6%), and against mild/asymptomatic infection was 14.0% (-12.1 to 34.0%). Controlling for vaccination, compared to those with an infection >2 years prior, infection within the past 6 months was associated with 58.6% (30.3 to 75.4%) increased protection against moderate infection, and 38.5% (5.8 to 59.8%) increased protection against mild/asymptomatic infection.

ConclusionsMonovalent XBB.1.5 boosters provided short-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly against moderate symptoms. Vaccine formulations which target the circulating variant may be suitable for inclusion in seasonal vaccination campaigns among healthcare workers.

Advances in RT strive to minimize these risks by reducing heart radiation dose exposure.

This study integrates detailed 3D dosimetry on individually delineated hearts with registry-based outcome data to assess the impact of radiation dose on cardiovascular morbidity and overall survival (OS) across multiple cancer types. It also examined the influence of patient-specific factors on cardiotoxicity risk and survival outcomes.

Materials and methodsWe analyzed data from 9,411 patients receiving RT at Rigshospitalet between 2009 and 2020 for breast, esophageal, lymphoma, and lung cancers. Cumulative incidence of CVD and death in the presence of competing risks was calculated with the Aalen-Johansen estimator. The impact of radiation dose and patient characteristics on ischemic heart disease (IHD) onset and OS were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional-Hazards Models.

ResultsHigher mean heart dose (MHD) was associated with poorer OS in breast and lung cancer patients (Hazard ratio 2.8 and 1.2), but no significant relationship was found between MHD and IHD. Established cardiac risk factors (age, sex, and existing IHD) outweighed cardiac dose as a risk factor for subsequent cardiac events for all diagnoses. The risk of death was greater than subsequent CVD, especially in esophageal and lung cancers (cumulative incidence 60% versus 17% and 60% versus 14%), despite comparatively high heart doses.

ConclusionThe study demonstrates that risk of death from primary cancer is of far greater concern than risk of subsequent cardiac events from cardiac radiation dose exposure in the range achievable with contemporary RT techniques, especially for lung and esophageal cancer patients. Further sparing of the heart should not be prioritized at the expense of adequate treatment of the index cancer.

HighlightsO_LIAge and existing heart disease far outweighed heart dose as predictors of ischemic heart disease
C_LIO_LIOverall survival is not a useful surrogate for cardiac toxicity in dose-response studies due to confounding by disease stage
C_LIO_LIWith modern RT techniques, the excess absolute risk attributable to radiotherapy is so small that a statistically significant dose-response could not be observed even in 9,411 patients
C_LIO_LIFor most patients, good quality contemporary radiotherapy is sufficient to limit heart toxicity as a clinically relevant concern

Limited research exists on the impact of School Distress on the parents/carers supporting these CYP. Using a case-control, concurrent embedded mixed-method design, we explored this lived experience. 947 parents of CYP with School Distress completed a bespoke online questionnaire, alongside two control parent groups (n=149, n=25) and one professional group (n=19).

Findings revealed a devastating impact on the mental health of parents, with parents displaying significantly heightened daily anxiety and significantly lower mood during, but not before, their childrens school attendance difficulties. In addition, parents with children experiencing School Distress reported significantly more negative emotion states and significantly fewer positive emotion states. Parents also reported overwhelmingly negative treatment from professionals, including being disbelieved or blamed for their childrens difficulties, threatened with fines and court action, and disempowered by the actions of professionals surrounding their child. Significant, deleterious impacts were also evident across all aspects of their lives, including their careers, finances, and other children. Perhaps unsurprisingly, half of these parents reported developing a new mental health condition since their childs difficulties began, with the experience itself rated as the second most threatening potential life event, superseded only by the death of a first-degree relative (including a child or spouse). On the other hand, professionals working with CYP with School Distress did not experience these deleterious mental health or wider life consequences. Despite understanding how threatening the experience is for parents, they were often quick to blame parents for their childrens difficulties. Professionals, like parents, expressed frustration with the lack of help available for these CYP and their families.

This study highlights a bleak, adversarial, and lonely picture for parents of CYP struggling to attend school. More specifically, the findings depict a system rife with parental blame; a system that appears to isolate parents through hostile, threatening, and punitive actions. A wider lack of societal understanding of the experience of School Distress further compounds this dearth of support for parents, placing parental mental health in further peril.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

MethodsThis study included all rheumatology RCTs published from 2009 to 2023. The gender of authors was determined using forenames and countries of affiliation via the gender API service. The percentage of women in RCT publications and its association with potential factors was assessed using generalized estimating equations, considering women gender as the main binary outcome and the RCTs continent, international collaboration status, industrial funding, intervention type, sample size, journal adherence to ICMJE recommendations, impact factor, publication year, authors non-academic affiliation, and author position as covariates.

ResultsAmong the 1,092 RCTs authored by 10,794 persons, women accounted for 34.1% of authors. Woman authorship was more frequent in African-based RCTs compared to North America, when the author had a non-academic affiliation and when the last author was a woman (1.83 [1.46, 2.29], +6.1 percentage points - pp). Woman authorship was less frequent in Asian and European-based RCTs, industry-funded RCTs (OR 0.64 [0.56-0.73]; -10.3pp). Women were less often in the last (0.63 [0.54-0.74]; -10.2 pp) and second to last author position (0.73 [0.62-0.85]; -7.3pp). There were no difference looking at international status or year of publication.

ConclusionThe overall presence of women authors was 34.1%. The stagnant year-over-year representation of women in RCTs, and the lower likelihood of a woman having a position as senior author, underscores the need for more effective strategies to bridge the gender gap. RCTs with a woman last author were more likely to have a woman first author, suggesting a potential role-model effect.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811

In line with the age-related neural dedifferentiation hypothesis, we predicted that middle-aged adults show less distinct cortical representations of phonemes and acoustic-phonetic features relative to younger adults. In addition to an extensive audiological, auditory electrophysiological, and speech perceptual test battery, we measured electroencephalographic responses time-locked to phoneme instances (phoneme-related potential; PRP) in naturalistic, continuous speech and trained neural network classifiers to predict phonemes from these responses. Consistent with age-related neural dedifferentiation, phoneme predictions were less accurate, more uncertain, and involved a broader network for middle-aged adults compared with younger adults. Representational similarity analysis revealed that the featural relationship between phonemes was less robust in middle-age. Electrophysiological and behavioral measures revealed signatures of cochlear neural degeneration (CND) and speech perceptual deficits in middle-aged adults relative to younger adults. Consistent with prior work in animal models, signatures of CND were associated with greater cortical dedifferentiation, explaining nearly a third of the variance in PRP prediction accuracy together with measures of acoustic neural processing. Notably, even after controlling for CND signatures and acoustic processing abilities, age-group differences in PRP prediction accuracy remained. Overall, our results reveal ""fuzzier"" phonemic representations, suggesting that age-related cortical neural dedifferentiation can occur even in middle-age and may underlie speech perceptual challenges, despite a normal audiogram.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling).

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.

MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).

ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

ConclusionThese findings suggest that HIF-2-mediated ED in PCS might be a potential therapeutical target for Belzutifan.

Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

The fossil, known on the basis of two specimens, has been historically assigned to seamoths (Pegasidae), then to oarfish and relatives (Lampriformes). We describe its enigmatic skeletal anatomy in detail, and provide a new genus name. ""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726870157811

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726870157811
