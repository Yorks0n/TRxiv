However, while considerable advances have been made in the de novo design of protein structure and function, the same has not yet been achieved for RNA tertiary structures of similar intricacy. Here, we describe a generative diffusion framework, RFDpoly, for generalized de novo biopolymer (RNA, DNA and protein) design, and use it to create diverse and designable RNA structures. We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

It explains individual differences of a broad range of subjective experiences, from the detail of mental imagery, the propensity to report having other internally generated visual experiences, and the vividness of visual dreams. Critically, simple vividness ratings can replace the protracted questionnaires commonly used for this purpose and reduce methodological issues with these instruments. We further find that vividness is closely linked with the experience of ""seeing"" mental images or projecting them into the external world. People who report seeing mental images with their eyes shut are also more likely to experience externally projected imagery. Nevertheless, many people report having mental depictions but without seeing. Overall, our results indicate we should redefine visual aphantasia to distinguish individuals with faint or unseen visual images from those completely lacking a pictorial representation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Because of their intracellular nature, the establishment of these interactions requires tight regulation by the host plants. In particular, three genes (SYMRK, CCaMK and CYCLOPS) form the core of an ancestral common symbiosis pathway (CSP) for intracellular symbioses, and are conserved since the most recent common ancestor of land plants (Radhakrishnan et al. 2020; Delaux et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2010; Parniske 2008). Here, we describe EPP1 as a fourth gene committed to the CSP. Among land plants, EPP1 is conserved only in species able to associate with at least one type of intracellular symbiont. We found that loss-of-function epp1 mutants or EPP1 knock down lines in four clades of land plants are all impaired in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We discovered that the plasma membrane-localized receptor-like SYMRK phosphorylates EPP1 on a conserved serine residue and that this phosphorylation is essential for symbiosis. Using a gain of-function approach, we demonstrate that EPP1 is upstream of the nuclear kinase CCaMK. We propose that EPP1 is an ancestral component of the essential pathway that has regulated plant symbiosis for half a billion years.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-LABX-41;ANR-18-EURE-0019;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037wke960"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPP1172165;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001675;""},{""name"":""European Union's Horizon 2020"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101105838;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Energy"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01bj3aw27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#DE-SC0018247;""},{""name"":""United States Department of Agriculture"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01na82s61"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#WIS05052;""},{""name"":""Secretaría de Ciencia, Humanidades, Tecnología e Innovación"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CBF-2025-I-12;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Yet, the mechanisms by which lipid imbalances are sensed and corrected to establish and maintain homeostasis are, in most cases, unknown. Here we present an expanded view of plasma membrane (PM) phosphoinositide metabolism by revealing an unexpected metabolic connection between two key anionic lipids in this membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and phosphatidic acid (PA). PM pools of PI4P are generated by PI 4-kinase Type III (PI4KIII/PI4KA), an essential enzyme whose partial dysfunction leads to numerous hereditary human diseases. We find that depletion of PI4P by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA increases the activity of phospholipase Ds (PLDs) and the levels of their lipid product, PA, in the PM. Guided by RNA-seq analysis and proximity labeling proteomics, we elucidate how cells connect this PI4P decrease to a compensatory increase in PA levels. Loss of PM PI4P induces a concomitant decrease of phosphatidylserine (PS) levels, and this metabolic rewiring activates a reciprocal relationship between PS synthesis and PLD-mediated PA generation. These metabolic changes also lead to transcriptional and translational upregulation of the small GTPase RhoB, which enhances PLD-mediated PA synthesis and subsequent actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Our study reveals how disease-relevant perturbation of phosphoinositide synthesis induces an integrated response that ultimately boosts levels of PA, a key anionic lipid and metabolic intermediate in phosphoinositide resynthesis.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qwkrw10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM151682;DP1GM142101;Intramural Research Program;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

In contrast, poised enhancers (PEs) are scarce in naive hPSCs that model pre-implantation epiblast. PEs form abundant chromosomal contacts with developmental genes, but when these contacts emerge, how their formation relates to enhancer poising and their functional significance remains incompletely understood. Here, we devise high-resolution, PE-targeted Capture Hi-C to generate a comprehensive atlas of PE chromosomal contacts in the time course of hPSC transition from the naive to primed state. We find that enhancer poising emerges early in the transition, while the contacts show diverse dynamics that is only partially coupled to poising. PROTAC-induced degradation of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) early in the transition weakens PE connectivity, while inhibition of its H3K27 methyltransferase activity does not, suggesting a non-catalytic role of Polycomb in supporting PE contacts. Notably, PE contacts persist after developmental activation or ectopic CRISPRa targeting and can mediate long-range gene induction. Together, these findings reveal the temporal and mechanistic principles of PE connectivity, highlighting a potential role of PE contacts in establishing gene expression patterns in human development.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC-A652-5QA20;""},{""name"":""BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/CCG2210/1;BB/IDG2210/1;BBS/E/B/000C0522;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225839/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""MRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/V02969X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Studies of West African arthropod diversity can therefore help address important questions regarding conservation, ecosystem services, and insecticide use and other species-control interventions in agriculture and disease management. We intensively sampled arthropods in Ghana using complementary trapping methods, generated DNA barcodes, and classified sequences by Barcode Index Numbers (BINs, a species proxy). Using this dataset, we investigate assemblage composition, temporal activity patterns, and the state of regional biodiversity sampling. Results: Sequencing DNA from 95,996 individuals captured using Malaise, yellow pan, pitfall, Heath and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) traps, we identified 10,120 unique BINs. The rate of species accumulation did not approach an asymptote for any taxonomic group or trap type, indicating high biodiversity. The different trap types sampled different subsets of the local community, with greatest similarity between yellow pan and pitfall traps. More insects and species (BINs) were trapped during the day than at night. Our dataset shared more BINs in the Barcode of Life Database with South Africa than with any other country, although this predominantly reflects the limited sampling and DNA sequencing campaigns in Africa. Conclusions: This study more than doubles the published BINs for West Africa, offering insights into the biodiversity of an ecologically important but understudied taxon and region. Using multiple trap types allowed a more complete assessment of the local arthropod assemblage. The public release of these data will support and stimulate further taxonomic and ecological work in the region.","[{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project"",""id"":""https://ror.org/004d1k391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Here, we present chromosome-level genomes for the two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus) and the southern anteater (Tamandua tetradactyla), and investigate how retrotransposon-mediated gene duplications (retrocopies) have shaped xenarthran genome evolution. Comparative analyses revealed that xenarthran genomes harbor the highest number of retrocopies reported among mammals, with lineage-specific insertion dynamics. Anteater and armadillo genomes contain older LINE1 repertoires and species-specific older retrocopy insertions. In contrast, sloths retain both an abundance of young LINE1s and thousands of young retrocopies, alongside a large shared set that originated from an evolutionary burst of retroduplication in the branch leading to their last common ancestor ([~]30 Mya). In C. didactylus, approximately 50% of retrocopies are expressed, compared with 24% in Dasypus novemcinctus. Evolutionary analyses identified 38 retrocopies with strong hallmarks of domestication in C. didactylus. Many of these retrocopies derive from parental genes involved in mitochondrial and metabolic processes, suggesting a genomic mechanism underlying the physiological specialisations of sloths.

EPP1 is recruited to the activated SYMRK receptor, where it is phosphorylated on a key serine residue, an event essential and sufficient to propagate symbiotic signaling. We provide structural and functional validation of the SYMRK-EPP1 signaling complex and demonstrate that EPP1 is required for root nodule formation.

The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors for lactate (HCAR1), {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (HCAR2), and octanoate (HCAR3) are encoded by three closely homologous GPCR genes co-located in a region where common genetic variation has been reportedly associated with lipid levels and body fat distribution. By resolving sequence homology in this region, we were able to refine this signal to a coding variant (R311C) in HCAR2. Using corrected genotypes from ~500K participants from UK Biobank and direct genotyping of four other studies, we found that carriage of the HCAR2 p.R311C variant was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes risk, reduced gynoid fat mass, increased waist-hip ratio, higher circulating triglycerides, glucose and alanine aminotransferase levels, lower levels of HDL cholesterol and adiponectin and impaired suppression of circulating levels of non-esterified fatty acids after oral glucose. Adipose tissue explants from mice engineered to express the equivalent mutation variant (p.R308C) in the mouse ortholog showed increased lipolytic activity, basally and after {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) treatment. In vivo, the mice were insulin resistant and had increased liver fat and impaired post-prandial suppression of NEFAs. The variant alters an amino acid located in the intracellular C-terminal tail of HCAR2, increasing recruitment of {beta}-arrestin and resulting in enhanced internalisation and reduced cell surface expression.

Processes that govern species-specific aspects of human postnatal brain development are difficult to study in animal models. While human brain organoids offer a promising in vitro model, they have thus far been shown to largely mimic early stages of brain development. Here, we developed human brain organoids for an unprecedented 5 years in culture, optimizing growth conditions able to extend excitatory neuron viability beyond previously-known limits. Using module scores of maturation-associated genes derived from a time course of endogenous human brain maturation, we show that brain organoids transcriptionally age with cell type-specificity through these many years in culture. Whole-genome methylation profiling reveals that the predicted epigenomic age of organoids sampled between 3 months and 5 years correlates precisely with time spent in vitro, and parallels epigenomic aging in vivo. Notably, we show that in chimeric organoids generated by mixing neural progenitors derived from 'old' organoids with progenitors from 'young' organoids, old progenitors rapidly produce late neuronal fates, skipping the production of earlier neuronal progeny that are instead produced by their young counterparts in the same co-cultures. The data indicate that human brain organoids can mature and record the passage of time over many years in culture. Progenitors that age in organoids retain a memory of the time spent in culture reflected in their ability to execute age-appropriate, late developmental programs.","[{""name"":""Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01tm9b530"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qwkrw10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Klarman Cell Observatory"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

While therapeutics have been developed to exploit these pH changes to modulate activity across different physiological environments, current approaches for generating pH-dependent binders, such as combinatorial histidine scanning and display-based selections, are largely empirical and often labor-intensive. Here we describe two complementary principles and associated computational methods for designing pH-dependent binders: (i) introducing histidine residues adjacent to positively charged residues at binder-target interfaces to induce electrostatic repulsion and weaken binding at low pH, and (ii) introducing buried histidine-containing charged hydrogen-bonding networks in the binder core such that the protein is destabilized under acidic conditions. Using these methods, we designed binders that dissociate at acidic pH against ephrin type-A receptor 2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, interleukin-6, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, and the interleukin-2 mimic Neo2. Fusions of the designs to pH-independent binders of lysosomal trafficking receptors function as catalytic degraders, inducing target degradation at substoichiometric levels. Our methods should be broadly useful for designing pH-sensitive protein therapeutics.","[{""name"":""Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04yhme281"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Audacious Project at the Institute for Protein Design"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Open Philanthropy Project Improving Protein Design Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Nordstrom Barrier Institute for Protein Design Directors Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute on Aging"",""id"":""https://ror.org/049v75w11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Behavioral Time-Scale Synaptic Plasticity (BTSP), identified in vivo, holds a great potential for explaining instantaneous hippocampal selectivity emergence by long-term potentiation (LTP), yet the cellular and endogenous mechanisms are unknown, impeding broader conceptualization of this novel rule for its algorithmic, systems-level and theoretical implications. Here, we addressed this gap by in-vivo, ex-vivo, in-silico and computational approaches to seek neurophysiologically inspired protocols for synaptically evoking Ca2+ plateau potentials and inducing potentiation in the CA1. We found induction of BTSP-LTP is best explained by a theta-oscillation-paced, gradually developed cellular state being supported with precisely timed weak ramping inputs. Remarkably, the previously presumed one-shot LTP for in-vivo place-field formation is possible under the influence of muscarinic activation. Through modeling, the notion of acetylcholine-gated BTSP gave rise to a computational advantage for low-interference continual learning. We further demonstrated that biophysics of Transient Receptor Potential (TRPM) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels powerfully shapes the cross-theta dynamics underlying BTSP. These results which cover pre-, post-synaptic and neuromodulatory factors and their timing suggest fundamental principles for graded plateau potentials and hippocampal LTP induction. Overall, our work dissects cellular mechanisms potentially important for a prominent in-vivo hippocampal plasticity phenomenon, and offers a biological basis for framing BTSP as an input-dynamics-aware, neuromodulation-tuned synaptic algorithm.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

We evolved six replicate diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations for 1,200 generations in glucose or galactose and quantified fitness every 300 generations under controlled history manipulations. Whole-genome sequencing across four time points per population revealed that adaptation was dominated by copy-number variations (CNVs), with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rare across lines and time. CNVs were strongly environment-specific: glucose-evolved populations showed early, widespread telomeric deletions encompassing carbon-use modules, followed by a reduction of deletion burden and appearance of compensatory duplications; galactose-evolved populations accumulated persistent telomeric and sub-telomeric duplications. Many of the same genes were targeted in opposite directions across environments (deleted in glucose, duplicated in galactose), linking structural remodeling to divergent physiological strategies. History-dependent fitness costs were pronounced early for glucose-evolved lines after galactose preculture but diminished by ~900 generations, whereas costs deepened in galactose-evolved lines after glucose preculture. A linear modeling framework identified ancestral fitness as the strongest predictor of evolved fitness, with evolutionary time contributing modestly and preconditioning/recovery exerting subtle, time-dependent effects. Together, these results argue that predictable, environment-specific CNV trajectories, rather than SNP accumulation, underlie the bulk of adaptation, and that structural variation operates within constraints imposed by the starting genotype and regulatory architecture.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04reqzt68"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IA/S/19/2/504632;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

For example, some boundaries between thalamic nuclei are disputed, whereas other nuclei are known to contain subdomains with distinct connectivity and function. Moreover, the correspondence between cellular gene expression and other properties of thalamic projection neurons remains to be established.

Characterization of STAU2 knockout iPSC derived cells using scRNA-seq shows that loss of STAU2 disrupts neuroepithelial cell identity and accelerates neural differentiation by altering the activity of key transcription factors and driving early metabolic transitions. Additionally, STAU2 regulates the expression of miRNA host genes and alters miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control in progenitor cells, which exerts additional effects on STAU2 regulated gene regulatory networks. These changes result in neural progenitor exhaustion, unstructured neural rosettes, and reduced organoid size.

These microbiota contribute to plant performance and health, in part by providing a microbial barrier against invading plant pathogens. To colonize plant hosts, pathogens not only have to overcome host immune responses, but also breach the microbial barrier, for which they secrete so-called effector proteins. Accordingly, the soil-borne fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae secretes the antimicrobial effector Ave1 to suppress antagonistic microbes and facilitate host colonization. Notably, many pathogens, including V. dahliae, have life stages outside their host plants, for instance in soil, where they encounter diverse microbial communities. Yet, how antimicrobial effectors support establishment across these environments remains poorly understood. To address this, we established a collection of natural soil samples with diverse physicochemical properties and microbiota compositions. Using this collection, we show for three plant species, barley, tomato and cotton, that root-associated bacterial and fungal communities are primarily shaped by the type of soil, whereas the phyllosphere microbiota is mainly determined by plant species. On tomato, we furthermore show that Ave1 differentially contributes to virulence on diverse soils, as Ave1 altered the tomato microbiota on all soils tested, but the taxa affected by these shifts varied depending on the specific soils. Our findings suggest that while Ave1-mediated microbiota manipulation occurs across soils, its impact on fungal virulence is influenced by the specific composition of the soil-derived microbiota assembled by the host.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

By systematically dissecting one such genomic locus, the COL1A1-SGCA locus, we identified redundant NS-targeting cis regulatory elements, including a ~600 bp fragment with 17 binding motifs for 8 transcription factors (TFs).

Despite recent progress in de novo design of protein binders, there are no current methods for designing binders that recognize phosphorylated proteins and peptides; this is a challenging problem as phosphate groups are highly charged, and phosphorylation often occurs within unstructured regions. Here we introduce RoseTTAFold Diffusion 2 for Molecular Interfaces (RFD2-MI), a deep generative framework for the design of binders for protein, ligand, and covalently modified protein targets. We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach. RFD2-MI provides a generalizable all-atom diffusion framework for probing and modulating phosphorylation-dependent signaling, and more generally, for developing research tools and targeted therapeutics against post-translationally modified proteins.","[{""name"":""NIH NCI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99CA293001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Although impaired angiogenesis is commonly observed in BRONJ, the underlying vascular mechanisms remain poorly understood, impeding the development of effective treatments. In this study, we integrated whole-organ tissue-clearing imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and proteomics to construct a multimodal atlas of the mandibular microenvironment in both mouse and human BRONJ. Our findings revealed gross vascular and lymphatic rarefaction in BRONJ, along with 4 endothelial subtypes uniformly exhibiting aberrant upregulation of Col2a1. Moreover, fibroblasts and macrophages emerged as key endothelial interactors, collectively underscoring dysregulation of the endothelium-matrix-immune axis. Unlike homeostatic Dmp1/Tfap2a fibroblasts and Stab1 macrophages, BRONJ lesions featured pathological Lrrc15/Chad fibroblasts and Il6 macrophages, which promote ectopic chondrogenesis and inflammation. Mechanistically, BRONJ activated the COL2A1-CD44 axis (EC-to-fibroblast/macrophage signaling) and COL2A1-SDC4 axis (EC-to-fibroblast signaling), whereas lineage tracing excluded endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), implicating extracellular matrix remodeling as the driver of dysfunction. Cross-species validation in human mandibles further confirmed vascular-lymphatic dysregulation, inflammatory activation, and aberrant chondrogenesis. Overall, this study establishes vascular and lymphatic dysfunction as a central pathological hallmark of BRONJ, driving matrix remodeling dysregulation and immune-inflammatory imbalance, and identifies the COL2A1-CD44/SDC4 axis as a potential therapeutic target for BRONJ.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Nature Science Foundations of China"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

While these models demonstrate race-based and binary gender biases, anti-LGBTQIA+ bias remains understudied despite documented healthcare disparities affecting these populations. In this work, we evaluated the potential of LLMs to propagate anti-LGBTQIA+ medical bias and misinformation. We prompted 4 LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, Stanford Medicine Secure GPT [GPT-4.0]) with 38 prompts consisting of explicit questions and synthetic clinical notes created by medically-trained reviewers and LGBTQIA+ health experts. The prompts consisted of pairs of prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms and explored clinical situations across two axes: (i) situations where historical bias has been observed versus not observed, and (ii) situations where LGBTQIA+ identity is relevant to clinical care versus not relevant. Medically-trained reviewers evaluated LLM responses for appropriateness (safety, privacy, hallucination/accuracy, and bias) and clinical utility. We found that all 4 LLMs generated inappropriate responses for prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms. The proportion of inappropriate responses ranged from 43-62% for prompts mentioning LGBTQIA+ identities versus 47-65% for those without. The most common reason for inappropriate classification tended to be hallucination/accuracy, followed by bias or safety. Qualitatively, we observed differential bias patterns, with LGBTQIA+ prompts eliciting more severe bias. Average clinical utility score for inappropriate responses was lower than for appropriate responses (2.6 versus 3.7 on a 5-point Likert scale). Future work should focus on tailoring output formats to stated use cases, decreasing sycophancy and reliance on extraneous information in the prompt, and improving accuracy and decreasing bias for LGBTQIA+ patients. We present our prompts and annotated responses as a benchmark for evaluation of future models. Content warning: This paper includes prompts and model-generated responses that may be offensive.

Author summaryLarge Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have the potential to enhance healthcare by assisting with tasks like responding to patient messages and assisting providers in making medical decisions. However, these technologies might inadvertently spread medical misinformation or reinforce harmful biases against minoritized groups. Our research examined the risk of LLMs perpetuating anti-LGBTQIA+ biases in medical contexts.

We tested four LLMs with prompts designed by medical and LGBTQIA+ health experts. These prompts addressed various clinical scenarios, some historically linked to bias against LGBTQIA+ individuals. Our evaluation revealed that all four LLMs produced responses that were inaccurate or biased for prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms mentioned. Qualitatively, the nature of inappropriate responses differed between these groups, with LGBTQIA+ identity terms eliciting more severe bias. The clinical utility of responses was, on average, lower for inappropriate responses than for appropriate responses.

These findings highlight the urgent need to ensure that LLMs used in medical contexts provide accurate and safe medical advice for LGBTQIA+ patients. Future efforts should focus on refining how LLMs generate responses, minimizing biases, and enhancing reliability in clinical settings in addition to critically examining use cases. This work is crucial for fostering equitable healthcare for all individuals.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759529325891

Experimental validation of two divergent Cas13an-like effectors demonstrated RNA knockdown capacity in human cells, confirming our framework's predictive power. These findings expand the functional repertoire of CRISPR-associated proteins and highlight unexplored modes of microbial immunity.

Risk is shaped by both heritable factors and non-genetic environmental, behavioral, and social determinants of health, but these are rarely modeled together. The growing availability of large-scale, multimodal biobanks creates new opportunities to integrate diverse data types into more accurate disease risk models. Here, we apply Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to over 100 environmental, behavioral, and social variables from the All of Us biobank (N = 171,614) to generate low-dimensional embeddings that quantify non-genetic risk for six common chronic conditions. These embeddings recovered known and novel risk factors and consistently improved prediction beyond demographics and polygenic scores (PGS), with contributions to model performance (ROC-AUC) ranging from 0.03 to 0.05. For five of six diseases, the gains from MCA embeddings surpassed those attributable to PGS. Genetic and non-genetic risks combined largely additively: we observed little evidence of interaction effects ({Delta}AUC < 0.001) and highly stable variant effect sizes when embeddings were included in genetic association models (r > 0.98). In summary, we introduce a scalable, interpretable framework that summarizes survey-based environmental, behavioral, and social factors without prior assumptions about disease-specific variables. Our results demonstrate that these non-genetic contexts substantially improve prediction while acting largely additively with genetic risk, clarifying the role of gene-environment interplay in complex disease and supporting more equitable and robust risk modeling across diverse populations.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759529325891

During this period, owls have evolved darker plumage and increased spottiness, two melanin-based traits associated with fitness. Whole-genome sequencing of 3,102 individuals reveals that these traits are largely controlled by few loci of major effect with partially overlapping architectures. Temporal allele frequency analyses show subtle but consistent shifts at these loci. Simulations indicate that genetic drift alone cannot explain these changes, whereas models incorporating selection do.

A potential solution is to decouple cell reproduction from product synthesis by dividing these conflicting tasks between two differentiated cell types. This work describes the use of an asymmetrically inherited protein cue to differentiate an E. coli culture into reproductive stem cells and fully dedicated factory cells. Cell differentiation is based on the ability to accumulate two factors: a variant of phage-derived T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) and GP2, a peptide that inhibits native host cell RNA polymerase. Activating these two factors in factory cells inhibited growth and focused them on T7RNAP-driven product synthesis. Preventing their accumulation in stem cells allowed this cell type to grow and divide asymmetrically, generating new factory cells in the process. These differentiating cell cultures generated over eight-fold higher target protein titers compared to factory cell-only controls. Because they include a mechanism for preventing leaky T7RNAP-driven gene expression in stem cells and pre-induction cultures, it was possible to generate strains with multiple plasmid-based copies of a cytotoxic target gene, whereas leaky expression made the same plasmid inviable in conventional protein expression strains. This versatile genetic system could be useful for generating higher product titers, particularly in cases where product synthesis causes cytotoxicity.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2222602;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas--premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mices behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load. We thus provide a framework for how task representations across the cortex reconfigure to support cognitive processes.","[{""name"":""EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 384-2020;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19NS132720;K99MH120047;R00K99MH120047;""},{""name"":""SCGB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AWD543027;""},{""name"":""C.V.

We use artificial selection to investigate the evolutionary response of clonal reproduction in the common monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus), a species with extensive life history variation. We first characterize the standing genetic variation in a single perennial population, and then conduct four generations of divergent artificial selection on stolon number - the mechanism of clonal reproduction in this species. To start, stolon number had moderate heritability (H2=0.25) and was negatively genetically correlated with reproductive traits. Artificial selection produced a clear but asymmetrical response. High selection lines made significantly more stolons, while low lines diverged less from controls. Analyses of G matrices revealed that selection not only changed trait means but also genetic correlations, with high lines diverging more in multivariate genetic architecture. Our results demonstrate that single populations harbor sufficient genetic variation to respond rapidly to selection on clonality, and the response is shaped by existing patterns of genetic covariation. The capacity for rapid evolution of clonal traits is particularly relevant as climate change alters selection and shifts the relative advantages of sexual versus clonal life-history strategies.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Two elite public soybean varieties, carrying either rhg1-a + Rhg4 or rhg1-b, negatively impacted Pp populations measured at 30 dpi. This contribution of Rhg1 was more rigorously demonstrated using near isogenic lines for rhg1-b. Additionally, in three of the four soybean SCN-susceptible genotypes tested we observed significantly more Pp when Pp were co-inoculated with SCN, consistent with a previous study. No significant changes in SCN cyst numbers upon co-inoculation with Pp were observed for any of the rhg1 resistant lines. No nematode-induced changes in Rhg1 transcript abundances were observed when sampling infected root sections in any of the plant genotypes, and no changes in a jasmonate response indicator were observed. However, the 3 dpi salicylate-mediated response to SCN or Pp became more robust during SCN + Pp co-infection.

Much progress has been achieved in recent years toward the development of innovative systems for artificial lighting, automated irrigation, plant handling, environment control and space use optimization in VF systems. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to generate mutant lines of transient protein expression host Nicotiana benthamiana presenting a compact, space-efficient phenotype compared to the so-called LAB strain commonly used for protein production. Our strategy consisted of altering apical dominance by suppressing the biosynthesis of strigolactone, a negative regulator of axillary bud outgrowth-promoting cytokinins. Strigolactone-depleted lines were generated by knocking-down the expression of either Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7 (CCD7) or Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8 (CCD8), two key enzymes of the metabolic pathway leading to strigolactone synthesis. Knocking-down the genes of either enzyme had no impact on the overall growth rate of the plant but drastically influenced its leaf proteome, auxin/cytokinin ratio and overall architecture. More specifically, the {Delta}CCD mutants exhibited altered glycolytic and malate-processing enzyme fluxes driving the production of pyruvate and cytokinins in leaf tissue, an axillary growth-oriented development pattern and, most importantly, a spatial footprint reduced by 45% to 50% compared to the LAB strain. Most importantly, recombinant protein yields per plant were maintained in the mutant lines, as here illustrated for the model protein GFP and for rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody of confirmed clinical value in humans. Our data demonstrate the usefulness of {Delta}CCD7 and {Delta}CCD8 knockout leading to strigolactone depletion for the generation of compact, space-efficient N. benthamiana lines well suited to VF systems intended for biopharmaceutical production.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

In this study we identify the Arabidopsis HEAT SHOCK FACTOR A1 (HSFA1) class of transcription factors, being key regulators of the heat stress response, as central players in wound-induced callus formation and shoot regeneration. Loss of HSFA1 function in the hsfa1abd triple mutants severely impairs cellular reprogramming, reducing callus formation from wounded hypocotyls, as well as shoot regeneration from explants. Conversely, overexpression of the HSFA1d gain-of-function variant markedly enhances regeneration. Time-series RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that HSFA1s directly activate the key reprogramming regulators WOUND-INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1), PLETHORA 3 (PLT3) and ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 6 (ZAT6). Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSFA1d activity is attenuated by SIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, linking post-translational modification to the regulation of wound responses. Our findings establish HSFA1s as an early transcriptional hub that integrates wound signals with the activation of a broad gene network that drives cellular reprogramming, thereby providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how stress-responsive transcription factors control regeneration.","[{""name"":""Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/048rj2z13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22K15150;20H04893;22H05075;24K02051;20H05911;23KF0089;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PRESTO JPMJPR20D2;Gtex JPMJGXx23B;ASPIRE JPMJAP2306;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Cachexia risk concentrated around periods of disease progression and associated with inferior outcomes in nearly all cancer types. Across cancers, cachectic episodes exhibited a consistent serologic signature characterized by low albumin and hemoglobin and high levels of liver enzymes. Numerous somatic tumor genotypes, including TP53 mutation across several diseases, were associated with elevated cachexia risk. Motivated by these observations, we developed a multivariate model to predict impending risk of cachexia in lung and colorectal cancer patients.

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Structural analyses reveal that constitutive Leucine Rich Repeat-malectin interactions preconfigure IGP1 for ligand recognition and that the receptor features a highly specific sugar-binding pocket in the LRR domain capable of distinguishing fine variations in glycan structures. By directly sensing cello-oligomers, IGP1 acts as a cell wall sentinel that links pathogen-induced wall degradation to immune alerting, equipping plants to mount rapid and robust defense responses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

We evaluated the environmental fate and transport of FPB and its degradants in water, plants, and sediment following application of the herbicide to two bays of Lake George, NY. FPB was rapidly lost from the water column within 72 hours, consistent with prior studies, but persisted in sediments for at least one year. Sediment cores revealed vertical migration of FPB, which may contribute to frequent non-detects in surface sediments and potentially explain why US EPA was unable to establish sediment half-lives in aquatic systems. Measured concentrations exceeded the 28-day no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) for chironomids for at least a year, highlighting the potential for long-term chronic exposure to benthic organisms. Modeled sorption and dilution scenarios aligned with field observations and indicated that circulation dynamics expanded the affected area beyond the direct treatment zones. These results demonstrate that FPB and its degradants persist longer in sediments than suggested by laboratory studies, raising important questions about long-term ecological risks, effects of repeated applications, and underestimation of sediment persistence. Long-term studies such as this are essential for understanding the fate of these compounds and for guiding informed decisions about future herbicide applications.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325891

Identifying how the brain actually solves efficient weighing of options requires the identification of the neural representation of this abstract yet precise computation. We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations.

In each case, the same gene was independently duplicated and co-opted, yet the resulting genomic architectures differed, ranging from hemizygous (present on one chromosome copy) to heterozygous (on both copies). These diverse architectures shaped supergene evolution differently, with genetic degeneration occurring only in the heterozygous case.

Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that{Delta} dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that{Delta} dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that{Delta} dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt. Altogether, these findings expand our knowledge of the Dma familys role in OMV biogenesis and demonstrates their importance in Bacteroides physiology.

ImportanceDual membrane-spanning anti-sigma factors (Dma) are a novel class of regulatory system found solely amongst Bacteroidota. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of Dma1 in vesiculation, but the overall role of the Dma family in Bacteroides physiology remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dma2 modulates vesiculation and regulates the expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that target host-associated glycans. In vivo studies revealed that Dma2 is an important fitness determinant when competing against kin bacteria. This work begins characterizing the multifaceted involvement of Dma2 in OMV biogenesis, PUL regulation, and colonization fitness.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

How its chromosome is dynamically reorganized across these contrasting states remains unclear. Here, we used synchronized predatory infections combined with time-resolved RNA-seq, Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and quantitative microscopy to map transcriptional activity and chromosome architecture across seven key stages of the predatory lifecycle. We uncover a dramatic shift in nucleoid organization - from an ultra-compact, transcriptionally restricted state in attack-phase cells to a progressively decompacted, ori-centered conformation during intracellular replication. Notably, distinct transcriptional and chromosome folding states not only mark the canonical attack and growth phases, but also critical transitions such as prey invasion, replication onset, and predator division. Temporal gene expression profiles reflect the coordinated regulation of core cellular functions across the predatory cycle. Furthermore, spatial localization of RNA polymerase, ribosomes, DNA-binding proteins, and freely diffusing proteins highlight the tight, cell cycle-dependent coupling between nucleoid compaction, chromosome accessibility, and transcriptional activity. Altogether, our findings reveal the intricate dynamics and coordination of genome folding and gene expression in a complex bacterial cell cycle driven by prey-predator interactions.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PREDATOR STG #802331;VAMPIRE COG #101171143;""},{""name"":""F.R.S.-FNRS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Crédit de Recherche &#34;PREDATOR NUCLEOID&#34;;""},{""name"":""Conseil Interuniversitaire de la Communauté Française de Belgique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Actions de Recherche Concertées &#34;PACHIDERM&#34;;""},{""name"":""WEL Research Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""WELBIO Starting Grant &#34;ARSENAL&#34;;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CHBS-0002;""},{""name"":""France Génomique"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-10-INBS-09;""},{""name"":""Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03356n642"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Institute Strategic Program Harnessing Biosynthesis for Sustainable Food and Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01097X/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

NANOG occupancy increased monotonously with its concentration, even though a common set of regions made accessible by OCT4 and SOX2 are highly and uniformly bound at all NANOG concentrations. In contrast, SOX2 occupancy does not increase with its concentrations, while OCT4 displayed an intermediate behavior.

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data.

METHODSThe KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin).

Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates).

RESULTSThe rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004).

CONCLUSIONS

Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV025280, INV077266;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""226432/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773830;""},{""name"":""Trond Mohn Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TMF2019TMT03;""},{""name"":""SARA project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Africa, through a grant from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs within the Fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Health Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UK Vietnam MRC Newton Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/N029399/1 RG83380;""},{""name"":""National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qwkrw10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

Whether chromatin assembly on newly replicated strands is also asymmetric remains unknown, as visualizing this short-lived state in cells is impossible. To circumvent this limitation, we combine in vitro reconstitution of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA and chromatin replication machineries with replication-aware single-molecule chromatin footprinting, to study how chromatin is re-assembled on replicated DNA. Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qwkrw10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Here, we identify mechanically activated ion channels PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 as key mechanotransducers required for labor progression. Genetic deletion of Piezo1 and Piezo2 in mice resulted in weakened uterine contractions and severe parturition defects. Tissue-specific knockouts revealed that deletion in either the uterus or sensory neurons alone caused modest defects, whereas combined loss significantly impaired labor, demonstrating additive effects. Single-nuclei sequencing showed that loss of PIEZO reduced expression of connexin43 (Gja1), a gap junction protein in uterine smooth muscle cells, suggesting a mechanistic link to impaired contraction. These findings highlight the critical role of PIEZO channels in mechanotransduction during parturition and suggest therapeutic targets for labor dysfunction.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35 NS105067;R01AT012051;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-2405-20;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CMMI-2135428;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2DK128800;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892

Yet these transitions also involve coordinated shifts in cell morphology and behaviour, which remain poorly characterized in densely packed epithelia. We developed a quantitative live-imaging and computational framework to track thousands of individual cells over time in the rapidly differentiating Xenopus mucociliary epithelium (MCE). From segmentations and trajectories, we extracted dynamic features-cell and nuclear shape, movement, position-to create a time-resolved morphodynamic dataset spanning the full course of differentiation. While single features showed high noise and low separability of ground-truth cell types, supervised machine learning revealed that integrating time-resolved features robustly predicts final cell fate. Gradient-boosted trees and multinomial logistic regression achieved moderate but consistent accuracy, especially for abundant epithelial lineages. Key discriminants included normalized Z-position, membrane-nucleus offset, and absolute experimental time, whereas movement contributed minimally to the results. Our results show that morphodynamic signatures encode predictive information about cell identity and provide a framework linking physical dynamics with molecular state.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21CC0073729;NNF19SA0035442;NNF22OC0076414;NNF19OC0056962;""},{""name"":""European Research Council CoG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101125803 MechanoFate;""},{""name"":""LEO Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02rgsr590"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LF-OC-19-000219;""},{""name"":""GENCI-IDRIS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A0161013396;AD011013695;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759529325892
