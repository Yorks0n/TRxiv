The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator MpGRAS7 in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. MpGRAS7 is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests MpGRAS7 is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of MpGRAS7 orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns. Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060043

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043
"Pain among US adults before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","10.1101/2024.10.24.24316018","medrxiv",25.5,15,22,22,25.5,"Zajacova, A.; Grol-Prokopczyk, H.","Anna Zajacova","University of Western Ontario","2024-10-25","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by_nc_nd","public and global health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/10/25/2024.10.24.24316018.source.xml","ImportanceChronic pain is a major public-health problem in the US. The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060043

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in Drosophila brains.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Related taxa tend to also live in similar ecological niches - this trend is termed Niche conservatism. Both concepts are widely used to understand crucial aspects of evolution and speciation and are well-established in animals and plants. The extension of these concepts to microorganisms is however challenging and thus far only assumed. Here, we hypothesize that two closely related microbial species, if indeed similar in both their morphology and their ecological niche, should be found in samples with similar community compositions. We propose ""community conservatism"" to refer to this, and leverage a database with millions of samples and hundreds of thousands of pairs of microbial taxa to assess their relatedness and the similarity of the communities they occupy. Our findings reveal that community conservatism can be observed globally in all environments and phyla tested, to varying extents. Ecologically specialized taxa show a stronger community conservatism signal than generalists, and the signal can be discerned over nearly all taxonomic ranks. Analyzing community conservatism shows promise to advance our understanding of evolution, speciation, and the mechanisms governing community assembly in microorganisms. Furthermore, we propose it can be used to reintegrate ecological parameters into Operational Taxonomic Unit delimitation.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Like pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) can be recognized by cell surface pattern recognition receptors leading to defensive transcriptional changes in host plants. Herbivore-induced defensive outputs are regulated by the circadian clock, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate how the plant circadian clock regulates transcriptional reprogramming of a specific HAMP-induced pathway, we characterized the daytime and nighttime transcriptional response to caterpillar-derived In11 peptide, in the legume crop cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Using diurnal and free-running conditions, we found that daytime In11 elicitation resulted in stronger late-induced gene expression than nighttime. Plants with a conditional arrhythmic phenotype in constant light (LL) conditions lost time-of-day dependent responses to In11 treatment, and this was associated with arrhythmic expression of circadian clock core transcription factor Late Elongated Hypocotyl VuLHY1 and VuLHY2. Reporter assays with VuLHY homologs indicated that they interact with the promoter of daytime In11-induced Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor (VuKTI) via a canonical and a polymorphic CCA1/LHY Binding Site (CBS), consistent with a mechanism of direct regulation by circadian clock transcription factors. This study improves our understanding of the time-dependent mechanisms that regulate herbivore-induced gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

CT-guided localised intestinal irradiation, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry revealed RT-induced chemokine-dependent recruitment of immune cells. Deletion of C-C chemokine receptor (Ccr)1, Ccr2, Ccr3 and Ccr5, blocked recruitment and worsened radiation induced toxicities. Furthermore, CCR2-deficient mice showed exacerbated weight loss and intestinal permeability, while the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes alleviated symptoms. Mechanistically, IL-17 cytokine production by group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), a critical factor in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, was reduced in irradiated CCR2-/-, however the transfer of Ly6C+ monocytes resulted in increased IL-17 levels.

The mechanisms imposing a different crossover landscape in female and male meiosis remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously disrupted multiple anti-crossover mechanisms in Arabidopsis and analyzed the whole genome sequence of thousands of female- and male-derived progenies. The largest crossover increase was reached in zyp1 recq4, with 12-fold in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males. Despite this unprecedented level of crossovers, fertility is marginally affected, opening new possibilities for plant breeding. Manipulating additional crossover regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further elevate the frequency of crossovers, but modified the relative contributions of the two known crossover pathways. This suggests an upper limit was reached and the two pathways compete for a large but limited set of recombination intermediates. Remarkably, while wild-type crossover distribution differs markedly between sexes, the crossover landscapes of diverse mutants in both females and males converge to a single novel profile, which we termed Crossover Potential (COP). The COP profile, which we defined using 49,482 crossovers, can be accurately predicted using only sequence divergence and chromatin features. We propose that the COP represents the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical in females and males. It suggests that the sexual dimorphism in the crossover landscape results exclusively from differential regulation of the likeness of precursors to mature into crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

A subset of people with LC present with symptoms resembling those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The objective of this study was to compare cortisol concentrations in those with and without Long COVID, with a particular focus on people experiencing ME/CFS-like Long COVID. METHODS: We measured plasma cortisol in 200 individuals 3-6 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Banked biospecimens collected between 8 AM-12 PM were used. Participants met the case definition for Long COVID if they had >=1 COVID-attributed symptom at least 3 months after symptom onset. People who did not report any symptoms at least 3 months after symptom onset served as recovered controls. Adapting the 2015 Institute of Medicine criteria for ME/CFS, we further defined those with LC resembling ME/CFS (LC-ME). RESULTS: We found no difference in overall morning cortisol concentrations between people with LC (n=144) and those who fully recovered (n=56) (median 8.9 g/dL vs. 8.8 g/dL, p=0.97). Analyses of samples collected between 8-10 AM, however, revealed that, compared to those who fully recovered, cortisol concentrations were lower between 8-9 AM for those with LC-ME (median 8.2 vs. 14.8, p=0.02), but higher between 9-10 AM for those with severe LC (>=5 symptoms) (median 12.4 vs. 8.5, p=0.009) and those with LC-ME (median 13.7 vs. 8.5, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: We found no difference in overall morning plasma cortisol concentrations between those with and without Long COVID. Although our data could be suggestive of altered morning cortisol dynamics in a subset of people with Long COVID, longitudinal measures of cortisol in individuals with Long COVID will be critical to further inform the biology of the condition.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060043

Recently, we challenged classical views of platelet generation, demonstrating that megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs), and ultimately platelets, can be specified via an alternate and additive route of HSC-direct specification specifically during aging. This ""shortcut"" pathway generates hyperactive platelets likely to contribute to age-related platelet-mediated morbidities. Here, we used single-cell RNA/CITEseq to demonstrate that these age-unique, non-canonical (nc)MkPs can be prospectively defined and experimentally isolated from wild type mice. Surprisingly, this revealed that a rare population of ncMkPs also exist in young mice. Young and aged ncMkPs are functionally distinct from their canonical (c)MkP counterparts, with aged ncMkPs paradoxically and uniquely exhibiting enhanced survival and platelet generation capacity. We further demonstrate that aged HSCs generate significantly more ncMkPs than their younger counterparts, yet this is accomplished without strict clonal restriction. Together, these findings reveal significant phenotypic, functional, and aging-dependent heterogeneity among the MkP pool and uncover unique features of megakaryopoiesis throughout life, potentially offering cellular and molecular targets for mitigation of age-related adverse thrombotic events.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

How external perturbations after initial exposure affect the duration of infection is unclear. We discovered that murine astrovirus, an enteric RNA virus, persists indefinitely when mice remain unperturbed but is cleared rapidly after cage change. Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

The noncovalent complex of ribozyme fragments initiates low level aminoacylation of one of the fragments, which after loop-closing ligation generates a highly active covalently-linked chimeric ribozyme. The generation of this ribozyme is increasingly efficient over time due to the autocatalytic assembly cycle that sustains the ribozyme over indefinite cycles of serial dilution. Due to its trans activity, this ribozyme also assembles ribozymes distinct from itself, such as the hammerhead, suggesting that RNA aminoacylation, coupled with nonenzymatic ligation, could have facilitated the emergence and propagation of ribozymes.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

For brevity, we use the term GLP-1 RA to refer to both GLP-1 RA and dual GLP-1 RA/GIP medications.

ObjectiveTo describe recent trends in prescribing and dispensing of GLP-1-based medications in the US.

MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the US, we identified people who were prescribed a GLP-1-based medication between January 01, 2018 and June 30, 2024. We describe prescribing volumes and patient characteristics over time, by medication, and by FDA-labeled use. Among the subset of patients for whom post-prescription dispensing data is available, we describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who were and were not dispensed a GLP-1 RA following their prescription.

Results1,162,662 patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and June 2024, with 4,815,135 total prescriptions during this period. Among first-time prescriptions for which use could be established, ADMs accounted for 83.0% and AOMs accounted for 17.0%. The most common first-time medication was semaglutide (n = 644,272). Among those with available data, 70.0% of first-time ADM prescriptions overall and 73.7% in March 2024 had a fill within 60 days. By comparison, 43.6% of first-time AOM prescriptions overall and 47.2% in March 2024 had a fill within 60 days.

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

This repeated cross-sectional study aimed to explore the long-term health and cognitive effects of COVID-19, focusing on how virus variants, vaccination, illness severity, and time since infection impact post-COVID-19 outcomes. We examined three cohorts of university students (N=584) and used non-parametric methods to assess correlations of various health and cognitive variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, time since infection, time since vaccination, and virus variants. Our results show that some health and cognitive impairments persist, with some even progressively worsening especially fatigue in women and memory in men, up to four years post-infection, with the Wuhan variant having the most significant long-term impact and the Omicron variant the least. Interestingly, the severity of the acute illness was not correlated with the variant of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis also revealed that individuals who contracted COVID-19 after vaccination had better health and cognitive outcomes compared to those infected before vaccination. The study also discusses some limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, particularly those arising from the stronger tendency of individuals with poorer health, compared to healthier individuals, to avoid infection and prioritize vaccination. To mitigate potential bias, the study proposes focusing on factors such as illness severity and time since infection or vaccination when analyzing persistent symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060043

Molecular dynamics simulations show C1P interaction promotes a long to short transition and energetically stabilizes Mshort. Cryo-EM structures show C1P specifically binds Mshort at a conserved site bridging transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Disrupting Mshort-C1P interaction alters M subcellular localization, reduces interaction with Spike and E, and impairs subsequent virus-like particle cell entry.

Restoration efforts and effective treatment of SCTLD requires an in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis in the coral holobiont as well as mechanisms of disease resistance. Here, we present a supervised machine learning framework to describe SCTLD progression in a major reef-building coral, Montastraea cavernosa, and its dominant algal endosymbiont, Cladocopium goreaui. Utilizing support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) in conjunction with differential expression analysis, we identify a subset of biologically relevant genes that exhibit the highest classification performance across three types of coral tissues collected from a natural reef environment: apparently healthy tissue on an apparently healthy colony, apparently healthy tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony, and lesion tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony. By analyzing gene expression signatures associated with these tissue health states in both the coral host and its algal endosymbiont (family Symbiodiniaceae), we describe key processes involved in SCTLD resistance and disease progression within the coral holobiont. Our findings further support evidence that SCTLD causes dysbiosis between the coral host and its Symbiodinaiceae and additionally describes the metabolic and immune shifts that occur as the holobiont transitions from a healthy to a diseased state. This supervised machine learning framework offers a novel approach to accurately assess the health states of endangered coral species and brings us closer to developing effective solutions for disease monitoring and intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

This identity shift, which involved the activation of a transcription factor cascade, was associated with alterations in neuronal firing activity. Our findings provide new insights into the cellular architecture of the claustro-insular region and highlights Nr4a2 as a master regulator of its components identities.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

This necessitates the development of therapies specifically targeting nonproliferating bacteria. To identify compounds active against non-growing uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) we performed a drug-repurposing screen of 6,454 approved drugs and drug candidates. Using dilution-regrowth assays, we identified 39 compounds that either kill non-growing UPEC or delay its regrowth post-treatment. The hits include fluoroquinolones, macrolides, rifamycins, biguanide disinfectants, a pleuromutilin, and anti-cancer agents. 29 of the hits have not previously been recognized as active against non-growing bacteria. The hits were further tested against non-growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Ten compounds -- solithromycin, rifabutin, mitomycin C, and seven fluoroquinolones -- have strong bactericidal activity against non-growing P. aeruginosa, killing >4 log10 of bacteria at 2.5 {micro}M. Solithromycin, valnemulin, evofosfamide, and satraplatin are unique in their ability to selectively target non-growing bacteria, exhibiting poor efficacy against growing bacteria. Finally, 31 hit compounds inhibit the growth of intracellular Shigella flexneri in a human enterocyte infection model, indicating their ability to permeate the cytoplasm of host cells. The identified compounds hold potential for treating persistent infections, warranting further comparative studies with current standard-of-care antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC), and H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells, responsible for calcium, chloride, and pH regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of multiciliated cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

This study directly probes whether the neural code of a phrase involves reactivating the syntactic property of a key subcomponent (the phrasal head). To this end, we train a part-of-speech sliding-window neural decoder (verb vs. adverb) on EEG signals recorded while participants (N = 30) read sentences in a controlled experiment. The decoder reaches above-chance performance that is spatiotemporally consistent and generalizes to unseen data across sentence positions. Appling the decoder to held-out data yields predicted activation levels for the verbal head of a verb phrase at a distant non-head word (adverb); the critical adverb appeared either at the end of a verb phrase, or at a sequentially and lexically matched position with no verb phrase boundary. There is stronger verb activation beginning at ~600 milliseconds at the critical adverb when it appears at a verb phrase boundary; this effect is not modulated by the strength of conceptual association between the two subcomponents in the verb phrase nor does it reflect word predictability. Time-locked analyses additionally reveal a negativity waveform component and increased beta-delta inter-trial phase coherence, both previously linked to linguistic composition, in a similar time window. With a novel application of neural decoding, our findings delineate the temporal dynamics by which the brain encodes phrasal representations by, in part, reactivating the representation of key subcomponents. We thus establish a link between cognitive accounts of phrase structure representations and electrophysiological dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Our evaluations of mcBERT across 7 million cells from 1223 individuals encompassing diverse disease states in heart, kidney, blood cell, and lung tissues show that learned representations facilitate a robust identification of disease cohorts and enable comparisons of patient similarity.

Here, we test four DNA extraction methods with the aim of identifying an efficient procedure to extract high-quality DNA from fecal material of canine, sheep, equine, bovine, and pig collected on dry blood spot cards, with the goal of generating good quality shotgun metagenomics datasets. Further, the suitability of Illumina shotgun metagenomic sequencing at 20million PE read depth was assessed on its ability to successfully characterize the taxonomic and functional aspects of the resulting fecal microbiome.

MethodsDNA was extracted from pig feces and mock communities collected on blood spot cards using four DNA extraction methods; two different methods of the QIAsymphony(R) PowerFecal(R) Pro DNA Kit, the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit, and the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit. Possible extraction bias was controlled by amplicon sequencing of mock communities. Fecal samples from canine, sheep, equine, bovine, and pig were thereafter subjected to the best performing DNA extraction method and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine sequencing efforts for functional and taxonomic analysis.

ResultsThe four DNA extraction methods demonstrated similar community composition in the sequenced bacterial mock community. The QIAsymphony(R) PowerFecal(R) Pro DNA Kit was identified as the DNA extraction method of choice, and the resulting DNA was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing with 20million PE reads. We found that higher number of reads increased the richness of observed genera between 100,000 and 5 million reads, after which higher sequencing effort did not increase the richness of the metagenomes. As for functional analysis, the number of low abundance functions in the metagenomes of the animals feces increased with sequencing depth above 20 million PE reads.

ConclusionOur experiments identified several methods suitable for extracting DNA from feces collected on blood spot cards. The Qiagens Blood and Tissue kit on the QiaSymphony platform fulfilled the criteria of high yield, quality, and unbiased DNA, while maintaining high throughput for shotgun metagenomic sequencing. A sequencing depth of 20 million PE reads proved adequate for taxonomic estimations and identifying common functional pathways. Detecting rarer traits, however, requires more sequencing effort.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these highly complex conditions remains limited. To gain deeper insights into the etiology of different brain diseases, we used specimens from 1,494 unique donors to generate a population-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), comprising over 6.3 million individual nuclei. The cohort includes neurotypical controls as well as donors affected by eight common and complex brain disorders: Alzheimers disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinsons disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We show that inter-individual variation accounts for a substantial portion of gene expression variation in the DLPFC. By comparing transcriptomic variation across diseases, we reveal universal signatures enriched in basic cellular functions such as mRNA splicing and protein localization. After discounting these cross-disease signatures, we show strong genetic and transcriptomic concordance among AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD, largely driven by alteration of synaptic signaling functions in neurons. Furthermore, we characterize transcriptomic variation among different AD phenotypes that were distinct from healthy aging. We uncover mitigating effects of interneurons and aggravating effects of immune and vascular cells in AD dementia. Further exploring the effect of the neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently accompanying AD, we identify a link to deep layer excitatory neurons. By constructing transcriptome trajectories that capture AD progression, we show cell-type specific responses implicated in early and late stages of AD. Our atlas provides an unprecedented perspective of the transcriptomic landscape in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, shedding light on shared and distinct processes involving the neuro-immune-vascular systems, and identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060043

PNNs are thought to regulate synaptic plasticity by stabilizing synapses and as such, could regulate learning and memory. Most often, PNN functions are queried using enzymatic degradation with chondroitinase, but that approach does not differentiate PNNs on CA2 neurons from those on adjacent PV cells. To disentangle the specific roles of PNNs on CA2 pyramidal cells and PV neurons in behavior, we generated conditional knockout mouse strains with the primary protein component of PNNs, aggrecan (Acan), deleted from either CA2 pyramidal cells (Amigo2 Acan KO) or from PV cells (PV Acan KO). Male and female animals of each strain were tested for social, fear, and spatial memory, as well as for reversal learning. We found that Amigo2 Acan KO animals, but not PV Acan KO animals, had impaired social memory and reversal learning. PV Acan KOs, but not Amigo2 Acan KOs had impaired contextual fear memory. These findings demonstrate independent roles for PNNs on each cell type in regulating hippocampal-dependent memory. We further investigated a potential mechanism of impaired social memory in the Amigo2 Acan KO animals and found reduced input to CA2 from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM), which signals social novelty. Additionally, Amigo2 Acan KOs lacked a social novelty-related local field potential response, suggesting that CA2 PNNs may coordinate functional SuM connections and associated physiological responses to social novelty.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) presents a statistical framework that embraces causal relationships among brain regions and their responses to experimental manipulations, such as stimulation. In this study, we perform Bayesian inference on a neurobiologically plausible generative model that simulates event-related potentials observed in magneto/encephalography data. This translates into probabilistic inference of latent and observed states of a system driven by input stimuli, described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and potentially correlated parameters. We provide a guideline for reliable inference in the presence of multimodality, which arises from parameter degeneracy, ultimately enhancing the predictive accuracy of neural dynamics. Solutions include optimizing the hyperparameters, leveraging initialization with prior information, and employing weighted stacking based on predictive accuracy. Moreover, we implement the inference and conduct comprehensive model comparison in several probabilistic programming languages to streamline the process and benchmark their efficiency. Our investigation shows that model inversion in DCM extends beyond variational approximation frameworks, demonstrating the effectiveness of gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of posterior estimation using a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the automatic Laplace approximation, effectively addressing parameter degeneracy challenges. This technical endeavor holds the potential to advance the inversion of state-space ODE models, and contribute to neuroscience research and applications in neuroimaging through automatic DCM.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Here we explore this question using the bacteriocins of E. coli as a model system, which are both well studied and have large well-annotated genomic resources. While bacteriocins are found widely across E. coli strains, we find that carriage is particularly associated with pathogenic extra-intestinal (ExPEC) strains, including many clinically-important pandemic strains. These pathogenic strains commonly carry large plasmids that encode the bacteriocins but also virulence factors, including siderophores, and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Across all E. coli strains, we find many orphan immunity proteins, which protect against bacteriocins and suggest that bacterial warfare is important in nature. We also present evidence that bacteriocin toxins readily move between strains via plasmid transfer and even between plasmids via transposons. Finally, we show that several E. coli bacteriocins are widely shared with the pathogen Salmonella enterica, further cementing the link to virulence. Our work suggests that the bacteriocins of E. coli are important antibacterial weapons for dangerous antimicrobial-resistant strains.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events. During fMRI scanning, they were guided to consider the event series from either an internal or external perspective in different tasks. Behavioral results confirmed the success of our manipulation, showing the expected symbolic distance effect in the internal-perspective task and the reverse effect in the external-perspective task. We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner. Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex retrieves event sequences egocentrically from the optimal perspective for the current task context. Such complementary allocentric and egocentric representations support both the stability of memory storage and the flexibility of time construals.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Despite existing evidence that not all phenotypes are equally likely to successfully establish in new areas, the mechanistic underpinnings of natal dispersal remain poorly understood. The propensity to disperse into a new environment can be favored by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity which facilitates local adaptation and may be achieved via epigenetic mechanisms, which modify gene expression and enable rapid phenotypic changes. Epigenetic processes occur in particular genomic regions (e.g. DNA methylation on CpG sites in vertebrates), and thus individual genomes may differ in their capacity to be modified epigenetically. This 'Epigenetic potential' (EP) may represent the range of phenotypic plasticity attainable by an individual, and be a key determinant of successful settlement in novel areas. We investigated the association between EP, quantified as the number of genome-wide CpG variants, and natal dispersal propensity in a long-term study population of Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) monitored since colonization of a new habitat 35 years ago. We tested this association at three levels, comparing EP between: i) individuals dispersing between and within habitat patches; ii) immigrants to the population and locally-born individuals; and iii) individuals from first (comprising colonizers or their direct descendants) and latter generations of the population (consisting of locally-born individuals, which did not show natal dispersal). Results show a significant, positive association between EP and dispersal propensity in comparisons i) and iii), but not ii). Furthermore, CpG variants were non-randomly distributed across the genome, suggesting species- and/or population-specific CpGs being more frequent in promoters and exons. Our findings point to EP playing a role in dispersal propensity at spatial and temporal scales, supporting the idea that epigenetically-driven phenotypic plasticity facilitates dispersal and environmental coping in free-living birds.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Despite their high conservation, homologous TBPs exhibit species- and tissue-specific functions that may contribute to the increasingly complex gene expression regulation across evolutionary time. To determine the molecular mechanisms of species- and tissue-specificity for homologous TBPs, we examined the ability of yeast TBP and murine TBP paralogs to replace the endogenous TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that, despite the high conservation in the DNA binding domain among the homologs, they cannot fully rescue the lethality of TBP depletion in mESCs, largely due to their inability to support RNA Pol III transcription. Furthermore, we show that the homologs differentially support stress-induced transcription reprogramming, with the divergent N-terminal domain playing a role in modulating changes in transcriptional response. Lastly, we show that the homologs have vastly different DNA binding dynamics, suggesting a potential mechanism for the distinct functional behavior observed among the homologs. Taken together, these data show a remarkable balance between flexibility and essentiality for the different functions of homologous TBP in eukaryotic transcription.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

To bridge this gap, we developed metapredict V3, an updated version of our disorder predictor that enables evolutionary-scale disorder prediction. Metapredict V3 enables proteome-scale prediction with state-of-the-art accuracy in seconds and was developed with a focus on usability. It is distributed as a web server, Python software package, command-line interface, and Google Colab notebook.

We recently identified a family of serine hydrolases termed fluorophosphonate binding hydrolases (Fphs) that play important roles in lipid metabolism and colonization of a host. Because many of these enzymes are only expressed in Staphylococcus bacteria, they are valuable targets for diagnostics and therapeutics. Here we developed and screened highly diverse cyclic peptide libraries using mRNA display with a genetically encoded oxadiazolone (Ox) electrophile that was previously shown to potently and covalently inhibit multiple Fph enzymes. By performing multiple rounds of counter selections with WT and catalytic dead FphB, we were able to tune the selectivity of the resulting selected cyclic peptides containing the Ox residue towards the desired target. From our mRNA display hits, we developed potent and selective fluorescent probes that label the active site of FphB at single digit nanomolar concentrations in live S. aureus bacteria. Taken together, this work demonstrates the potential of using direct genetically encoded electrophiles for mRNA display of covalent binding ligands and identifies potent new probes for FphB that have the potential to be used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

A subset of sequenced SAR11 genomes, predominantly in the brackish and freshwater SAR11 subclades, contain homologs of pha genes, which in other organisms confer the ability to store carbon and energy via polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymers. Here, we investigated the relevance of PHA production to SAR11 biology. Phylogenetics showed that Pha proteins occurred on a long branch and provided evidence for origin at the common ancestor of the brackish IIIa and freshwater LD12 subclades, followed by horizontal transfer within SAR11. Using the LD12 representative ""Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis"" strain LSUCC0530, we found that a large minority of LSUCC0530 cells contained a single Nile red-staining granule, confirmed that the cells produced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and estimated the total PHB content in the cells. We heterologously expressed the LSUCC0530 phaCAB locus in Escherichia coli, finding it to be functional and the likely origin of the PHB. We also determined that, irrespective of changes to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, a similar fraction of LSUCC0530 cells generated PHB granules and expression of the phaCAB locus remained constant. We suggest that PHB synthesis in LSUCC0530 may be constitutively active due to the slow growth dynamics and minimal regulation that characterize SAR11 bacteria. This is the first characterization of polymer storage in SAR11, providing new insights into the likely fitness advantage for cells harboring this metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Increasing rates of drug resistance in human-only Plasmodium species are reducing the efficacy of control efforts and antimalarial treatments. There are also rising cases of P. knowlesi, the only zoonotic Plasmodium species that causes severe disease and death in humans. Thus, there is a need to develop additional innovative strategies to combat malaria. Viruses that infect non-Plasmodium spp. disease-causing protozoa have been shown to affect pathogen life cycle and disease outcomes. However, only one virus (Matryoshka RNA virus 1) has been identified in Plasmodium, and none have been identified in zoonotic Plasmodium species. The rapid expansion of the known RNA virosphere using structure- and artificial intelligence-based methods suggests that this dearth is due to the divergent nature of RNA viruses that infect protozoa. We leveraged these newly uncovered data sets to explore the virome of human-infecting Plasmodium species collected in Sabah, east (Borneo) Malaysia. We identified a highly divergent RNA virus in two human-infecting P. knowlesi isolates that is related to the unclassified group  ormycoviruses. By characterising fifteen additional ormycoviruses identified in the transcriptomes of arthropods we show that this group of viruses exhibits a complex ecology at the arthropod-mammal interface. Through the application of artificial intelligence methods, we then demonstrate that the ormycoviruses are part of a diverse and unclassified viral taxon. This is the first observation of an RNA virus in a zoonotic Plasmodium species. By linking small-scale experimental data to large-scale virus discovery advances, we characterise the diversity and genomic architecture of an unclassified viral taxon. This approach should be used to further explore the virome of disease-causing Apicomplexa and better understand how protozoa-infecting viruses may affect parasite fitness, pathobiology, and treatment outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Traditionally, studies have focused on the role of contemporary ecology--such as pollinator or mate availability--in driving spatial patterns in reproductive assurance within species, however, historical processes such as post-glacial range expansion may be an understudied alternative explanation for geographic variation in mating system. This is because during the process of geographic range expansion into novel habitat, selection should favour individuals that possess traits promoting reproductive assurance (i.e., autonomous selfing or clonal reproduction). Here, we used Northern pink monkeyflower--Erythranthe (Mimulus lewisii--a hermaphroditic, self-compatible, perennial, alpine plant, as a focal species to investigate the historical signatures of geographic range expansion by combining phylogeographic analyses with a greenhouse survey of range-wide reproductive assurance. First, we detected significant geographic variation among populations in two components of reproductive assurance: self-fertilization and clonal propagation. Next, using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, we identified three distinct genetic clusters structured by longitude and estimated geographic coordinates of the most likely origins of range expansion within each cluster. We found that both measures of reproductive assurance significantly increased on average with distance from the inferred biogeographic origin, which is consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive assurance undergoes adaptive evolution during range expansion. This study supports hypotheses underlying Baker's Law and contributes to our understanding of spatial variation in reproductive assurance, which is linked to variation in evolutionary potential, adaptability, and the long-term persistence of populations across large spatial scales.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

These predictions are related to dispersal limitation at the leading edge driving colonization dynamics, a scenario common in post-glacial range expansion at the continental scale ([~]20,000 years ago). However, post-glacial range expansion can also occur on contemporary time scales, such as alpine glacier recession following the end of The Little Ice Age ([~]150 years ago) and our understanding of dispersal limitation structuring these instances of rapid range expansion are relatively understudied. Here, we test whether there is evidence supporting the role of dispersal limitation during range expansion following alpine glacier retreat using the native alpine plant Erythranthe (Mimulus) lewisii by examining patterns of neutral genetic diversity (single nucleotide polymorphisms) across the history of glacier recession (i.e., glacier chronosequence) across two glacier forelands in Garibaldi Provincial Park, BC. We find weak support for the prediction of increasing clines in genetic differentiation towards the range edge, and no support for decreasing clines in genetic diversity, suggesting dispersal limitation is not characterizing colonization during range expansion, with the implication that the accumulation of expansion load at the range edge is likely not applicable on these spatiotemporal scales. Together, our results suggest that loss of genetic diversity for range-shifting species in the alpine is likely not a key contributing factor to any decreased fitness over time.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

ObjectivesWe aimed to investigate performance and portability of contemporary PRS for ASCVD subtypes: coronary heart disease (CHD), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), ischemic stroke (IS), and peripheral artery disease (PAD), using the All of Us Workbench which provides access to a large diverse cohort with phenotype and whole genome sequence data. We also developed and evaluated a multi-trait PRS for each subtype.

MethodsPerformance of PRS for 4 ASCVD traits and related risk factors was compared across genetic ancestry groups in 245,388 All of Us participants. Genetic EUR, African (AFR), Admixed American (AMR), and remaining ancestry groups (combined as Other, OTH) were defined by All of Us based on principal components. PRS for CHD, IS, AAA, PAD, and multi-trait (combining PRS for the 4 traits as well as PRS for ASCVD risk factors) were assessed for portability across genetic ancestry groups using hazard ratios (HR) per SD increase.

ResultsFor CHD, CHDPGS003725 performed the best (HR for 1 SD increase [95% CI]), across 4 genetic ancestry groups (EUR: 1.72[1.67-1.78], AFR: 1.24[1.18-1.31], AMR: 1.48[1.37-1.59], OTH: 1.65[1.52-1.79]). The best performing PRS for AAA was AAAPGS003972 (EUR: 1.68[1.59-1.78], AFR: 1.29[1.13-1.48], AMR: 1.30[1.06-1.60], OTH: 1.45[1.20-1.75]). The best performing IS PRS was ISPGS000039 in AFR (1.12[1.06-1.17]), AMR (1.11[1.04-1.19]), and OTH (1.23[1.09-1.38]), and ISPGS004939 in EUR (1.16[1.12-1.20]). For PAD, PADPGS004940 performed best in EUR (1.26[1.22-1.30]), AFR (1.11[1.05-1.18]), AMR (1.08[1.01-1.16]), and OTH (1.13[1.04-1.22]). Multi-trait PRS performed better than individual trait PRS for each ASCVD phenotype. Also, PRS derived from multi-ancestry cohorts performed better than those derived from single ancestry.

ConclusionsPRS for ASCVD developed from multi-ancestry cohorts and multiple related traits performed best across ancestrally diverse and admixed individuals. PRS for CHD and AAA performed better than those for IS and PAD.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060043

This lack of genetic causal inference method limits our ability to translate HLA associations into therapeutic targets. Here we present a method that uses HLA alleles, instead of nucleotide variants, to perform genetic colocalization of two traits at HLA genes. The method, which we call HLA-colocalization, works by controlling for LD using Bayesian variable selection, then performing Bayesian regression on the resulting posterior inclusion probabilities. We first show through simulation that the method correctly identifies truly colocalizing genes. We then test the method in two positive control scenarios, showing colocalization between hepatitis B and liver disease at HLA-DPB1, and between Epstein-Barr virus and multiple sclerosis at HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. Lastly, we perform a large colocalization scan between multiple viruses and auto-immune diseases, demonstrating that the method is well calibrated, and uncovering multiple biologically plausible novel causal associations, such as cytomegalovirus and ulcerative colitis.

To regulate these processes, RABs are tightly regulated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Activated RABs recruit effector proteins that regulate trafficking. Identifying RAB-associated proteins has proven to be difficult because their association with interacting proteins is often transient. Recent advances in proximity labeling approaches that allow for the covalent labeling of neighbors of proteins of interest now permit the cataloging of proteins in the vicinity of RAB GTPases. Here, we report APEX2 proximity labeling of 23 human RABs and their neighboring proteomes. We have used bioinformatic analyses to map specific proximal proteins for an extensive array of RAB GTPases, and RAB localization can be inferred from their adjacent proteins. Focusing on specific examples, we identified a physical interaction between RAB25 and DENND6A, which affects cell migration. We also show functional relationships between RAB14 and the EARP complex, or between RAB14 and SHIP164 and its close ortholog UHRF1BP1. Our dataset provides an extensive resource to the community and helps define novel functional connections between RAB GTPases and their neighboring proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

However, the absence of easily implementable techniques for screening microbial biodegradation potential, coupled with the limitations of non-functional omics analyses, has restricted comparative studies across diverse polymer types and ecosystems. In this study, we optimized a novel airbrushing method that facilitates functional analyses by simplifying the preparation of polyester-coated plates for biodegradation screening. By repurposing an airbrush kit, polyester microparticles (MPs) could be evenly sprayed onto solid media, enabling rapid detection of extracellular depolymerizing activity via clearing zone halos. This technique was effective in screening both isolated microbial cultures and natural environmental samples, demonstrating its versatility. The method was successfully applied across multiple environments, ranking the biodegradability of six polyesters, from most to least biodegradable: polycaprolactone (PCL), poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB), poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), poly(ethylene succinate) (PES), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT). Most notably, it revealed a consistent 1,000-fold higher biodegradation potential in terrestrial compared to marine environments. This approach offers a valuable tool for isolating novel polyester-degrading microbes with significant biotechnological potential, paving the way for improved plastic waste management solutions.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Currently, the most prevalent method to determine cellular tomogram resolvability is an empirical judgment by experts, which is time-consuming. Methods like FSC between split tilt series suffer from severe geometrical artifacts. We address this gap with a neural network model to predict per-slice resolvability that can apply to tomograms collected from various species and magnifications. We introduce a novel metric, ""TomoScore"", providing a single-value evaluation of cellular tomogram quality, which is a powerful tool for pre-screening tomograms for subsequent automatic segmentation. We further explore the relationship between accumulated electron dose and resulting quality, suggesting an optimum dose range for cryo-ET data collection.

To explore the potential evolutionary origins of the double cone, we analyzed single-cell and -nucleus transcriptomic atlases of photoreceptors from six vertebrate species: zebrafish, chicken, lizard, opossum, ground squirrel, and human. Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red [-&gt;] green [-&gt;] blue [-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Prioritizing analysis of multicopy genes that could signal importance for Borg lifestyles, we uncovered highly represented de-ubiquitination-like Zn-metalloproteases that may counter host targeting of Borg proteins for proteolysis. Also prevalent are clusters of multicopy genes for production of diverse glycoconjugates that could contribute to decoration of the host cell surface, or of putative capsid proteins that we predict multimerize into hexagonal arrays. Features including megabase-scale linear genomes with inverted terminal repeats, genomic repertoires for energy metabolism, central carbon compound transformations and translation, and pervasive direct repeat regions are shared with giant viruses of eukaryotes, although analyses suggest that these parallels arose via convergent evolution. If Borgs are giant archaeal viruses they would fill the gap in the tri(um)virate of giant viruses of all three domains of life.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Here, we used multidimensional in-situ imaging techniques to illuminate how host organ structure and bacterial microbiogeography contribute to the symbiotic function of an organ in the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. Along with the well-studied light organ, female E. scolopes harbor a community of bacteria in the accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The ANG is a dense network of epithelium-lined tubules, some of which are dominated by a single bacterial taxon. These bacteria are deposited into squid eggs, where they defend the developing embryos from harmful biofouling. This study used a combination of imaging techniques to visualize different dimensions of the ANG and its bacterial communities. Imaging entire organs with light sheet microscopy revealed that the ANG is a composite tissue of individual, non-intersecting tubules that each harbor their own bacterial population. The organ is bisected, with tubules converging towards two points in the organ. At these points, tubules empty in a space where bacteria can mix with squid jelly to be deposited onto eggs. Observations of bacterial populations correlated bacterial taxa with cell morphology and show that tubule populations varied: some contained populations of mixed phyla while some tubules contained only one genus of bacteria. Together, these data shed light on how bacterial populations interact within the ANG and how the host uses physical structure to maintain and employ a symbiotic bacterial population in a defensive context.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060043

Here, we present a new overlapping, alternate-frame insertion (OAFI) method for creating overlapping genes by insertion of an inner gene, encoded in an alternate frame, into a flexible region of an outer gene. Using OAFI, we create new overlapping gene pairs of bacterial toxins within an antibiotic resistance gene. We show that both the inner and outer genes retain functionality despite redesign, with translation of the inner gene is influenced by its overlap position in the outer gene. Additionally, we show that selection for the outer gene alters the permitted inactivating mutations in the inner gene and that overlapping toxins can restrict horizontal gene transfer of the antibiotic resistance gene.

We discovered that both dopamine receptor types are present in the central medial nucleus, while the lateral part is populated predominantly with DRD2 cells. Exposing mice to rewarding and aversive stimuli we studied DRD1 and DRD2 cells activity using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the CeM. We showed that cocaine and sugar predominantly increase the activity of DRD1(+) neurons and decrease DRD2(+) cells. Repeated exposure to cocaine, however, had the opposite effect on spontaneous excitatory synaptic transmission in the CeM than exposure to sugar. Quinine, an aversive stimulus, primarily engaged DRD2(+) neurons, activating predominantly those cells that were previously inhibited by sugar exposure.

We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing lifespan, and that shoot apical meristems are protected from this aging process.

By using latent space manipulation techniques, we directly interpreted and visualised what specific latent phenotypes were capturing in a given MRI. To establish the genetic basis of such traits, we performed a genome-wide association study, identifying 89 significant common variants (P < 2.3x10-9) across 42 loci, including seven novel loci. Extensive multi-trait colocalisation analyses (PP.H4 > 0.8) linked these variants to various cardiac traits and diseases, revealing a shared genetic architecture spanning phenotypic scales. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) derived from latent phenotypes demonstrated predictive power for a range of cardiometabolic diseases and high risk individuals had substantially increased cumulative hazard rates across a range of diseases. This study showcases the use of diffusion autoencoding methods as powerful tools for unsupervised phenotyping, genetic discovery and disease risk prediction using cardiac MRI imaging data.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060044

Their expansion shapes genome variability and evolution by impacting gene expression and rearrangement rates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are beneficial plant symbionts with large, TE-rich genomes, and recent findings showed these elements vary significantly in abundance, evolution, and regulation among model AMF strains. Here, we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TE function and evolution in AMF by investigating assembled genomes from representatives of all known families. We uncovered multiple, family-specific bursts of insertions in different species, indicating variable past and ongoing TE activity contributing to the diversification of AMF lineages. We also found that TEs are preferentially located within and around candidate effectors/secreted proteins, as well as in proximity to promoters. Altogether, these findings support the role of TEs in promoting the diversity in proteins involved in molecular dialogues with hosts and, more generally, in driving gene regulation. The mechanisms of TEs evolution we observed in these prominent plant symbionts bear striking similarities to those of many filamentous plant pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundance. However, the vast number of distinct k-mers makes k-mer counting a significant resource bottleneck. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. To mitigate the excessive redundancy caused by overlapping k-mers, super-k-mers were introduced, significantly decreasing memory usage. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency. In this work, we introduce hyper-k-mers, a novel approach that further reduces redundancy. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new representation of k-mers that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 bits per nucleotide for super-k-mers to 4 bits per kmer. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm that leverages hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose resource usage does not scale linearly with the size of k and is the fastest option for large k-mer sizes.

We approached organization by profiling the activity and spatial location of >23,000 neurons recorded in awake mice. Regularly firing neurons were over-represented in most PFC subregions, yet a fine-grained activity map of the PFC did not align with cytoarchitecturally defined subregions. Instead, we observed a robust relationship between spontaneous activity patterns and intra-PFC hierarchy, suggesting internal organization principles transcending cytoarchitecture. Single neuron responses to sounds did not reflect intra-PFC hierarchy but were linked to spontaneous firing rate, indicating that responsiveness increases with excitability and is decoupled from the PFC's intrinsic operational structure. Our data-driven approach provides a scalable roadmap to explore functional organizations in diverse brain regions and species, opening avenues to link activity, structure, and function in the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

Microtubule growth, shortening and transitions between them are linked to GTP hydrolysis. Recent evidence suggests that flexible tubulin protofilaments at microtubule ends adopt a variety of shapes, complicating structural analysis using conventional techniques. Therefore, the link between GTP hydrolysis, protofilament structure and microtubule polymerization state is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of microtubule ends using coarse-grained modeling supported by atomistic simulations and cryo-electron tomography. We show that individual bent protofilaments organize in clusters, transient precursors to a straight microtubule lattice, with GTP-bound ends showing elevated and more persistent cluster formation. Differences in the mechanical properties of GTP- and GDP-protofilaments result in differences in intra-cluster tension, determining both clustering propensity and protofilament length. We propose that conformational selection at microtubule ends favors long-lived clusters of short GTP-protofilaments that are more prone to form a straight microtubule lattice and accommodate new tubulin dimers. Conversely, microtubule ends trapped in states with unevenly long and stiff GDP-protofilaments are more prone to shortening. We conclude that protofilament clustering is a key phenomenon that links the hydrolysis state of single tubulins to the polymerization state of the entire microtubule.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

These disparities are reported among migrants and black and ethnic minorities in Europe and North America. Lived experience perspectives from marginalised and multiple disadvantaged people are neglected in research yet may offer vital and novel insights into preventive opportunities to reduce coercive care

MethodsWe conducted a participatory photovoice research process to assemble the life- experiences of people within two years of receiving CAT. We purposively sampled to maximise diversity by age, ethnicity, and different  sections of the Mental Health Act (England & Wales, 1983, 2007) from 8 health systems in England. The images, captions, and reflective narratives were deepened over 3 workshops before thematic analysis.

OutcomesForty-eight ethnically diverse people with lived experience of CAT contributed over 500 images and 30 hours of transcribed narratives. Participants lives showed significant complexity in terms of multimorbidity, adverse childhood experiences, and carer roles. The findings suggest insufficient co-ordination to prevent CAT despite early help-seeking, not being taken seriously when seeking help, hostility and dismissive responses from professionals; unnecessary police involvement which was distressing, stigmatising, and risked criminalisation. Participants wanted more advocacy given their vulnerability and inability to process information in crisis, as well as therapeutic and creative activities in inpatient environments. Participants recommended more family and carer involvement, and more appropriate, frequent and personalised information about care options, appeals processes, levels of restriction, and seclusion. A major concern was the lack of highly skilled staff, trauma-informed care, and therapies into the community.

InterpretationWe showed epistemic injustice in care processes and recommend better standards for essential skills, prevention, trauma informed care and therapies. Criminalising and coercive responses must also be reduced.

However, it remains unclear how well traits explain variation in the outcomes of current and novel competition, as well as the underlying processes determining coexistence or competitive exclusion, under changing climate. Here, we conducted a field experiment in which pairs of high and low-elevation species interacted in three sites across an elevation gradient in the Swiss Alps. For each species pair, we quantified the population-level outcomes of competition (invasion growth rates), relative fitness differences and niche overlap and related these to 15 functional traits that were measured in each site. Most traits were significantly associated with invasion growth rates at the low elevation, where species had greater relative fitness differences, but these associations were much weaker towards higher elevations. This appears to be because traits, particularly those associated with light competition, captured species relative fitness differences at lower elevations, but not at the high elevation site. Greater relative fitness differences towards lower elevations suggest that climate warming may increase the likelihood of competitive exclusion of species that are poor competitors for light. In addition, novel competitors tended to show greater niche overlap than current competitors, leading to stronger overall competitive effects. But in general, trait differences predicted competitive outcomes of novel and current competitors similarly well, suggesting that traits can be used to predict interactions between species that do not yet interact. Our study reinforces the importance of considering changing interactions for predicting species responses to climate change and provides experimental evidence supporting the usefulness of functional trait differences in forecasting the impacts of future plant interactions under changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

The TGN disintegration resulted from its acute deacidification caused by disassembly of the Golgi V-ATPase. Mechanistically, Sac1 mediated TGN membrane composition maintained an assembly promoting conformation of the V0a2 subunit. Key phenotypes of acute Sac1 degradation were recapitulated in human differentiated trophoblasts, causing processing defects of chorionic gonadotropin, in line with loss-of-function intolerance of the human SACML1 gene.

However, data on the type of antibiotics prescribed for such infections is only available for children <5 years in the UK. Understanding the contribution of RSV to antibiotic prescribing would facilitate predicting the impact of RSV preventative measures on antibiotic use and resistance.

ObjectivesTo estimate the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions in English general practice attributable to RSV by age and antibiotic class.

MethodsGeneralised additive models examined associations between weekly counts of general practice antibiotic prescriptions and laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from 2015 to 2018, adjusting for temperature, practice holidays and remaining seasonal confounders. We used general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and microbiology tests for RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human Metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae from Englands Second Generation Surveillance System.

ResultsAn estimated 2.1% of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, equating to an average of 640,000 prescriptions annually. Of these, adults [&ge;]75 years contributed to the greatest volume, with an annual average of 149,078 (95% credible interval: 93,733-206,045). Infants 6-23 months had the highest average annual rate at 6,580 prescriptions per 100,000 individuals (95% credible interval: 4,522-8,651). Most RSV-attributable antibiotic prescriptions were penicillins, macrolides or tetracyclines. Adults [&ge;]65 years had a wider range of antibiotic classes associated with RSV compared to younger age groups.

ConclusionsInterventions to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in older adults, could complement current strategies to reduce antibiotic use in England.","NA","medrxiv",1731190060044

Abscisic acid (ABA) signalling has long been recognized as a key positive regulator of this process, coordinating the expression of genes that drive the acquisition of vital seed quality traits (SQTs) crucial for survival, resilience, and storage. However, the precise molecular regulation of many SQTs remains elusive. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive transcriptome analysis of seed maturation in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on Col-0 wild-type and ten mutant lines affecting ABA biosynthesis, signaling, and catabolism from 12 days after pollination up to the dry seed stage. Our study employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and module-trait correlation to uncover specific gene groups linked to the regulation of multiple SQTs. We identified Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) genes uniquely associated with desiccation tolerance and three DREB AND EAR MOTIF PROTEIN (DEAR) transcription factors involved in seed longevity regulation. The value of our dataset lies not only in its depth and detail, but also in its integration into SeedMatExplorer, a web tool specifically designed to advance seed maturation research. SeedMatExplorer serves as a unique resource, enabling researchers to explore, visualize, and generate new hypotheses about gene expression regulation during seed maturation and the intricate control of SQTs.

Here, we systematically evaluate how genetic diversity impacts gene- and sub-genic intolerance metrics by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data from 460,551 UK Biobank participants and 125,748 gnomAD participants across diverse ancestral backgrounds. Through comprehensive analysis of randomly sampled datasets with varying ancestral compositions, we demonstrate that genetic diversity, rather than sample size alone, drives the performance of intolerance metrics in identifying functionally critical genes and genic sub-regions. Notably, scores trained on variation observed in African and Admixed American ancestral groups showed superior resolution in detecting neurodevelopmental disease risk genes and haploinsufficient genes compared to scores trained on variation observed in European ancestry cohorts. Most strikingly, the Missense Tolerance Ratio (MTR) trained on 43,000 multi-ancestry exomes demonstrated greater predictive power than when trained on a nearly 10-fold larger dataset of 440,000 non-Finnish European exomes, indicating that European ancestry-based scores are approaching saturation.

Inspired by previous work on an association between genetic evidence and clinical success, we used retrospective analysis of known drug target genes to identify potential predictors of target clinical success from scRNA-seq data. We investigated whether successful drug targets are associated with cell type specific expression in a disease-relevant tissue (cell type specificity), and with cell type specific over-expression in disease patients compared to healthy controls (disease cell specificity). Analysing scRNA-seq data across diseases and tissues, we found that both cell type and disease cell specificity are features enriched in targets entering clinical development, and that cell type specificity in the disease-relevant tissue is robustly predictive of target progression from Phase I to II. While scRNA-seq analysis identifies a larger and complementary target space to that of direct genetic evidence, its association with specificity and drug approval appears less clear.

Little is known about JCV pathogenesis, and no host factors required for cellular infection have been identified. Recently, we identified low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (Lrp1) as a host entry factor for two other bunyaviruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Oropouche virus (OROV). Here, we assessed the role of Lrp1 in mediating JCV cellular infection of neurons. Both neuronal and non-neuronal immortalized cell lines deficient for Lrp1 displayed reduction in infection with JCV, and early stages of infection such as binding and internalization were impacted by lack of Lrp1. In primary rat neurons, Lrp1 was highly expressed, and the neurons were highly permissive for JCV infection. Treatment of primary neurons with recombinant receptor-associated protein (RAP), a high affinity ligand for Lrp1, resulted in reduced infectivity with JCV. In addition, pretreatment of cells with RVFV Gn inhibited JCV infection, suggesting that the two viruses may share overlapping binding sites. These results provide compelling evidence that Lrp1 is an important cellular factor for efficient infection by JCV, and thus multiple bunyaviruses with varying clinical manifestations and tissue tropism are facilitated by the host cell Lrp1. Reliance of multiple bunyaviruses on Lrp1 makes it a promising target for pan-bunyaviral antivirals and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

Holding isometric muscle actions (HIMA) are largely unknown, although practitioners prescribe them in rehabilitation and performance contexts. The lack of knowledge and consensus in research on the distinction between two isometric types and limited scientific backing makes appropriate use in clinical and performance contexts difficult.

ObjectiveTo gather research directly comparing PIMA and HIMA, and to summarize and synthesize findings. We also aimed to identify potential practical applications for both tasks. Lastly, we highlight existing gaps in the literature and propose directions for future research.

MethodsCINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles comparing PIMA and HIMA in humans. Risk-of-bias and study quality were assessed via established assessments for quasi-experimental studies and funnel plots, respectively. Findings were synthesized where possible, with meta-analyses and meta-regressions performed on time-to-task-failure (TTF), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR), and mean arterial pressure (MAP).

ResultsFifty-four studies (publication year=2012.9{+/-}6.9; 1995-2024) were identified (N=856 participants; [~]29.5{+/-}10.1 years). Thirty-five included performance parameters (e.g., TTF), 45 examined neurological outputs (e.g., electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography), and 14 explored cardiovascular or metabolic (e.g., glucose uptake, oxygenation) variables. Meta-analysis of 23 studies revealed consistently longer TTF for PIMA vs HIMA at the same absolute intensity (n=407; g=-0.74, p<0.001), except for two studies examining axial muscles (g=1.78-3.59, p<0.001). Meta-analyses of 6-11 studies detected no absolute differences in HR, MAP, or RPE (n=136-194; g=-0.11 to 0.18, p=0.07-0.96), except for RPE at 50% of TTF being greater during PIMA (n=164; g=-0.31, p=0.01). PIMA mostly showed higher force fluctuations, discharge rates, D1-inhibition and peak torque, while HIMA indicated higher heteronymous facilitation, EMG burst rates, interspike interval variation, muscular glucose uptake, and faster increases in force/position fluctuations, EMG amplitude, RPE, HR, and MAP. Findings on muscle activation were mixed. HIMAs showed fewer neurological alterations during experimental joint pain.

ConclusionsEvidence suggests distinguishing two types of isometric muscle action indicating more complex control strategies for HIMA than PIMA. Findings revealed similarities to anisometric actions, suggesting that the control strategies of HIMA and PIMA resemble the ones for muscle lengthening and shortening, respectively. HIMAs could provide a time-efficient approach for inducing musculoskeletal, neural, and cardiovascular adaptations in rehabilitation. PIMA may be beneficial for prolonged activation and agonist neuromuscular adaptations. Methods varied widely across studies, making additional meta-analyses impossible. More consistent methodology and data reporting are recommended. Randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the use of PIMA vs HIMA in clinical or performance contexts. The knowledge of both isometric types should be implemented in research and education.

RegistrationThe original protocol was prospectively registered at the National Institute of Health Research PROSPERO (CRD42024530386).

Key PointsO_LISports medicine practitioners often use pushing (PIMA) and holding (HIMA) isometric muscle actions in rehabilitation and sports performance, yet limited evidence supports their differentiated use.
C_LIO_LIHIMA generally reduces time-to-task-failure, except in cases involving axial muscles. Minimal differences were found in absolute heart rate, mean arterial pressure, or ratings of perceived exertion, although the rate of increase was higher during HIMA.
C_LIO_LIHIMA typically increases antagonist and synergist muscle activation, glucose uptake, and electroencephalography coherence. Trends in fatigue and agonist activation varied, while fewer neurological alterations were observed during experimental joint pain.
C_LIO_LIWhile randomized control trials are needed, PIMA seems more beneficial for agonist neuromuscular adaptations, while HIMA appears suitable for time-efficient musculoskeletal and cardiovascular rehabilitation.

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These suggest that the additional NTD glycosylation of KP.3.1.1 and XEC could enhance immune evasion via allosteric effects, and supports the future prevalence of XEC.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.
C_LIO_LIA reference database containing all the known genome sizes, built from the NCBI databases, with associated taxa, provided in an archive to download.
C_LIO_LIA taxonomic tree structure as built by the NCBI, provided in the same archive.

However, the underlying mechanisms and disease relevance are not fully understood. We have recently identified RH1115 as a small molecule modulator of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway that regulates lysosome positioning in neurons. This allowed us to manipulate neuronal lysosome distribution including in axons and interrogate its contribution to both optimal neuronal functioning and to disease pathology. We demonstrate that the small molecule not only rescues aberrant buildup of both axonal autophagic and lysosomal intermediates but also reduces secreted A{beta}42 levels in human iPSC-derived neurons lacking the lysosomal adaptor, JIP3. We thus demonstrate that restoring efficient axonal lysosome transport has an anti-amyloidogenic effect in human neurons and is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, we show that the small molecule enhances neuronal lysosome degradation, requires the lysosomal adaptor JIP4 to rescue the axonal lysosome pathology in the JIP3 KO neurons and increases levels of the JIP4-interacting lysosomal membrane protein, TMEM55B. Lastly, treatment with the small molecule led to a striking rescue of locomotor defects in JIP3 KO zebrafish larvae.

Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods.

Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731190060044
