The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Recombinant proteins, consisting of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and Spike Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) fused with nanoluciferase reporters (GloBodies) were designed and produced. The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody within serum, from venous blood or eluted from local or remotely-obtained dried blood spots, form a complex with the GloBody, which can be captured on immobilized Protein G or anti-isotype antibody with the retained nanoluciferase activity being proportional to specific antibody levels. Natural infection, vaccination and human and animal SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detectable. These were used to serially monitor infection and vaccination responses in dental healthcare workers (n=82), medical healthcare workers (n=72) and laboratory-based scientists (n=62) within the Royal London, dental and medical hospitals and associated university research institute in Whitechapel, East London. This indicated temporally distinct infection and vaccination profiles, consistent with hospital deployments and local and national lockdowns by dentists and scientists. As such, medical healthcare workers had twice the odds of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms (2.01 95%CI 1.13-3.58. P<0.001) compared to dentists, who were more at risk than scientists. Likewise, those who performed virus exposure-prone procedures exhibited twice (1.98. 95% CI 1.18-3.34 P=0.01) the odds of symptoms and exhibited higher nucleocapsid titres (0.21 95%CI 0.05-0.38.

We conducted a multi-country evaluation of two novel swab-based molecular tests: Molbio Truenat MTB Ultima (MTB Ultima) and Pluslife MiniDock MTB Test (MiniDock MTB).

MethodsConsecutive people [&ge;]12 years old with presumptive TB were enrolled at outpatient health centers in India, Uganda, and Vietnam. We collected two tongue swabs and prepared two sputum swabs for MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB testing, then evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB using both swab types against a sputum liquid culture-based microbiological reference standard (MRS). The diagnostic accuracy of swab-based molecular tests was also compared to sputum Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) and auramine smear microscopy.

FindingsFrom January to September 2024, 1,050 participants were included in the tongue swab MTB Ultima evaluation, 197 in the sputum swab MTB Ultima evaluation, and 322 in the MiniDock MTB evaluations. In comparison to sputum Xpert Ultra, sensitivity was similar for both sputum swab MTB Ultima (93.6% vs. 100.0%, difference -6.4%, [95% CI: -15.5, 2.7], p=0.25) and MiniDock MTB (91.0% vs. 94.0%, difference -3.0% [95% CI: -8.6, 2.6], p=0.50). In comparison to sputum smear microscopy, sensitivity was higher for both tongue swab MTB Ultima (77.9% vs. 59.1%, difference 18.8% [95% CI: 10.8, 26.8], p<0.0001) and MiniDock MTB (85.7% vs. 67.1%, difference 18.6% [95% CI: 7.2, 29.9], p=0.001). Specificity was high (>98%) for both tests with sputum swabs and tongue swabs.

InterpretationMTB Ultima and MiniDock MTB have similar accuracy to current sputum-based molecular tests with sputum swabs and meet minimum accuracy thresholds for a non-sputum, near point-of-care molecular test with tongue swabs. These tests offer strong potential to make universal molecular testing for TB a reality.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Characterising key epidemiological parameters for H5N1 is critical should it become widespread.

AimTo identify and estimate critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 from past and current outbreaks, and to compare their characteristics with human influenza subtypes and the 2003 Netherlands H7N7 outbreak.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews reporting parameter estimates from primary data or meta-analyses. To address gaps, we searched PubMed and Google Scholar for studies of any design providing relevant estimates. We estimated the basic reproduction number for the outbreak in the US and the 2003 Netherlands H7N7 outbreak. In addition we estimated the serial interval for H5N1 using data from previous household clusters in Indonesia. We also applied a branching process model to simulate transmission chain size and duration to assess if simulated transmission patterns align with observed dynamics.

ResultsFrom 46 articles, we identified H5N1s epidemiological profile as having lower transmissibility (R0 < 0.2) but higher severity compared to human subtypes. Evidence suggests H5N1 has a longer incubation ([~]4 days vs [~]2 days) and serial intervals ([~]6 days vs [~]3 days) than human subtypes, impacting transmission dynamics. The epidemiology of the US H5 outbreak is similar to the 2003 Netherlands H7N7 outbreak. Key gaps remain regarding latent and infectious periods.

ConclusionsWe characterised critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 infection. The current U.S. outbreak shows lower pathogenicity, but similar transmissibility compared to prior outbreaks. Longer incubation and serial intervals may enhance contact tracing feasibility. These estimates offer a baseline for monitoring changes in H5N1 epidemiology.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Large-scale real-world data (RWD), such as electronic health records (EHR), encodes practice-based evidence that is of tremendous value to CTD. In recent years, many machine learning methods have been developed to extract such real-world evidence (RWE) from the RWD to inform CTD, but they still need to be communicated with the domain experts extensively in an iterative manner to be further refined and ultimately useful. In this paper, we introduce TrialGenie, an agentic framework that derives RWE for helping with CTD. Through the iterative conversation and analysis across agents with different roles, TrialGenie can autonomously refine trial protocols and finally generate a robust report containing insights that inform better CTD. We applied TrialGenie on the CTD process of several acute diseases including septic shock, acute heart failure, acute pulmonary edema, and acute kidney injury using the MIMIC-IV data. The results demonstrate TrialGenies capabilities in facilitating and accelerating the CTD process.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

To better characterize the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of poor sleep in autism, we recruited 5,686 families from SPARK, a nationwide genetic study of autism, who described their sleep experiences using the Childrens Sleep Health Questionnaire (CSHQ) and other self-report items. The collective experiences from this large sample allowed us to discover eight distinct archetypes of sleep in autism. Membership in some of these archetypes showed significant SNP-heritability (0.50 - 0.65, 95% confidence interval = 0.08 - 1), and polygenic estimates of educational attainment, BMI, and ADHD risk contributed extensively to the genetic signatures of these sleep archetypes. Surprisingly, polygenic estimates of general population sleep phenotypes showed sparser and more modest associations, perhaps suggesting that the genetic drivers of disordered sleep in autism may be distinct from those encountered in the general population. GWAS on archetype membership yielded no genome-wide significant loci, however, the most significant gene for the most severe archetype was the nitric oxide (NO) signaling gene NOS1AP, which was previously linked to sleep disruption in schizophrenia. Finally, the eight sleep archetypes showed specific signatures of treatment response across five major categories of sleep aid, pointing to the potential of treatment plans that are tailored to the nature of the sleep problem. These findings provide critical new insight into the comorbidities, subtypes, and genetic risk factors associated with disordered sleep in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Methods We used plasma samples collected from subjects diagnosed with MIS-C and compared them first to controls with asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and then to controls with pneumonia or Kawasaki disease. We used mass spectrometry to identify proteins. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm-based classification schemes were used to analyze protein pathways. We assessed diagnostic accuracy using internal and external cross-validation. Results Proteomic analysis of a training dataset containing MIS-C (N=17), and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=20) identified 643 proteins, of which 101 were differentially expressed. Plasma proteins associated with inflammation and coagulation increased and those associated with lipid metabolism decreased in MIS-C relative to controls. The SVM machine learning algorithm identified a three-protein model (ORM1, AZGP1, SERPINA3) that achieved 90.0% specificity, 88.2% sensitivity, and 93.5% area under the curve (AUC) distinguishing MIS-C from controls in the training set. Performance was retained in the validation dataset utilizing MIS-C (N=17) and asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infected control samples (N=10) (90.0% specificity, 84.2% sensitivity, 87.4% AUC). We next replicated our approach to compare MIS-C with similarly presenting syndromes, such as pneumonia (N=17) and Kawasaki Disease (N=13) and found a distinct three-protein signature (VWF, SERPINA3, and FCGBP) that accurately distinguished MIS-C from the other conditions (97.5% specificity, 89.5% sensitivity, 95.6% AUC). We also developed a software tool that may be used to evaluate other protein pathway signatures using our data. Conclusions We used MIS-C, a novel hyperinflammatory illness, to demonstrate that the use of mass spectrometry to identify candidate plasma proteins followed by machine learning, specifically SVM, is an efficient strategy for identifying and evaluating biomarker signatures for disease classification.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

These risk variants have also been shown to influence the structure of the cerebral cortex. However, it is unknown whether cortical differences associated with genetic variants are linked to the risk they confer for NPDs. To answer this question, we analyzed cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) for common and rare variants associated with NPDs, in [~]33000 individuals from the general population and clinical cohorts, as well as ENIGMA summary statistics for 8 NPDs. Rare and common genetic variants increasing risk for NPDs were preferentially associated with total SA, while NPDs were preferentially associated with mean CT. Larger effects on mean CT, but not total SA, were observed in NPD medicated subgroups. At the regional level, genetic variants were preferentially associated with effects in sensorimotor areas, while NPDs showed higher effects in association areas. We show that schizophrenia- and bipolar-disorder- associated SNPs show positive and negative effect sizes on SA suggesting that their aggregated effects cancel out in additive polygenic models. Overall, CT and SA differences associated with NPDs do not relate to those observed across individual genetic variants and may be linked with critical non-genetic factors, such as medication and the lived experience of the disorder.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

In 74.5% of cases ctDNA was equivalent or superior to biopsy for genetic profiling. Patients not suitable for ctDNA genotyping had low tumor volumes and could be predicted from simple clinical factors. Finally, a phased variant-supported minimal residual disease (MRD) assay was predictive of outcomes in all groups analyzed. Patients achieving ctDNA clearance at end of treatment had an extremely low 2-year progression rate (<5%). However, false positive MRD results were common in patients with transformed indolent lymphoma. This study highlights the considerable potential, but also the caveats and limitations, of ctDNA technology when applied to aggressive B-cell lymphoma.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

However, the lack of scalable and efficient methods to integrate large-scale multi-omics data limits deeper insights into xQTL regulation. Here, we propose ColocBoost, a multi-task learning colocalization method that can scale to hundreds of traits, while accounting for multiple causal variants within a genomic region of interest. ColocBoost employs a specialized gradient boosting framework that can adaptively couple colocalized traits while performing causal variant selection, thereby enhancing the detection of weaker shared signals compared to existing pairwise and multi-trait colocalization methods. We applied ColocBoost genome-wide to 17 gene-level single-nucleus and bulk xQTL data from the aging brain cortex of ROSMAP individuals (average N = 595), encompassing 6 cell types, 3 brain regions and 3 molecular modalities (expression, splicing, and protein abundance). Across molecular xQTLs, ColocBoost identified 16,503 distinct colocalization events, exhibiting 10.7({+/-}0.74)-fold enrichment for heritability across 57 complex diseases/traits and showing strong concordance with element-gene pairs validated by CRISPR screening assays. When colocalized against Alzheimers disease (AD) GWAS, ColocBoost identified up to 2.5-fold more distinct colocalized loci, explaining twice the AD disease heritability compared to fine-mapping without xQTL integration. This improvement is largely attributable to ColocBoosts enhanced sensitivity in detecting gene-distal colocalizations, as supported by strong concordance with known enhancer-gene links, highlighting its ability to identify biologically plausible AD susceptibility loci with underlying regulatory mechanisms. Notably, several genes including BLNK and CTSH showed sub-threshold associations in GWAS, but were identified through multi-omics colocalizations which provide new functional support for their involvement in AD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

However, there has been a relative paucity of investigation focused on mpox community engagement in DRC, including assessments of disease knowledge and risk perception. Methods: Given the ongoing Clade I mpox public health emergency of international concern, and the linkage between sustained human-to-human transmission and dense sexual networks, we sought to investigate mpox knowledge and sexual behaviours among key populations. Between March 20, 2024, and August 25, 2024, we recruited 2794 participants distributed across Kinshasa, Kwango and North Kivu provinces, with a focus in urban centers where mpox risk was considered high. Results: Most participants were considered other at-risk populations (1035; 37.0%), followed by men who have sex with men (MSM, 831; 29.7%) and sex workers (810; 29.0%). Mpox knowledge, including transmission routes, as well as sexual and health-seeking behaviours were evaluated through questionnaires led by peer educators. Overall, only 6.1% of all participants reported prior mpox knowledge. Among this participant subset, zoonosis (direct contact with infected animals) and people living in high-risk areas were the most frequently selected options in regard to mpox transmission and populations at risk, respectively. When considering at-risk behaviors for mpox, those that identified as sex workers reported significantly higher risk sexual activities including multiple sexual partners (80.3% of sex work participants), engaging in transactional sex (84.7.0%), and anonymous sex (80.8%) compared to MSM. However, both sex workers (44.8%) and MSM (56.7%) reported the highest health seeking behaviors for a suspected sexually transmitted infection. Conclusion: Our results highlight that community engagement which incorporates both mpox knowledge and risk perception activities and is inclusive of at-risk populations are needed for ongoing mpox containment and mitigation efforts.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Historical data suggest that hypokinetic features, like rigidity and bradykinesia, become more prominent in later stages of HD. No evidence-based analysis has confirmed this observation. Additionally, several motor features of the disease are not clearly defined as hypokinetic or hyperkinetic. Objectives: This study aimed to 1) elucidate the trajectory of hyperkinetic and hypokinetic features across the disease course and 2) to classify vague motor features as following a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Methods: Data from 13,475 motor-manifest HD patients from the Enroll-HD platform were analyzed. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed for each of the 31 Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) motor subscales, with disease burden as the primary predictor. The models were used to generate the trajectories of features known to represent hyperkinesis and hypokinesis, with the same being done for vague subscales. Dynamic time warping (DTW) was then used to classify said subscales as having a hyperkinetic or hypokinetic trajectory. Results: Hyperkinetic features rise initially and diminish in middle disease, while hypokinetic features continually increase across the disease course. All non-choreiform features demonstrated a hypokinetic-like trajectory. Conclusions: HD is generally considered a hyperkinetic movement disorder, but the middle and late stages of the disease are predominated by hypokinesis. These findings suggest that hypokinetic features may be a larger contributor to the overall motor burden of HD. This has significant implications for clinical trial design, motor phenotype clustering, and pharmacotherapy.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

However, it remains less clear how sleep behaviors can be modified by lifestyle, and specifically, whether sexual behaviors may confer sleep benefits. Evaluating these possibilities requires pilot studies that can provide necessary prerequisite data to motivate or guide larger definitive trials. Here, we utilized established Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance, sleep relatedness, and sexual function and satisfaction scales questionnaires of sleep behaviors and sexual satisfaction in combination with wearable actigraphy devices and performed a pilot three-way, 18-day cross-over study in adult monogamous women. Three, four-day interventions including (i) intercourse with their partner, (ii) masturbation only with a computer-controlled female vibrational device, and (iii) combined use of both the partner and the device were assessed. We tested the hypothesis that sleep efficiency and rapid-eye-movement (REM) duration were similarly increased during all forms of sexual activity compared to three-day interval washout periods of sexual abstinence. Across all participants and measures (n=4; age=34.0+/-10.4 years), findings were consistent with improvements in sexual satisfaction and interest in sexual activity after the trial as assessed by the PROMIS sexual satisfaction survey (t-statistic) at intake (44.6+/-10.5) vs. closeout (55.2+/-6.5). There was no significant difference in established metrics of sleep behaviors for epochs when masturbation was used vs. a partner was used; however, 75% of women exhibited evidence of an increase in sleep efficiency and REM sleep duration during the masturbation epoch compared with washout epochs with sexual abstinence, with a large effect size of 0.799. Findings are intended to provide feasibility data on the relevance of computer-controlled masturbation devices and assessing these devices with wearable technologies, and corroborate anecdotal evidence of the impact of these devices on objective markers of women's health.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

The extent to which policies impacted person-to-person contact remains unclear. In this study, we examined changes in contact patterns and their association with behaviors and governmental recommendations in Japan during the pandemic. Ten social contact surveys were conducted between 2021 and 2023 reaching over 1500 participants per survey in Osaka and Fukuoka prefectures where governmental recommendations were first implemented due to high COVID-19 incidence. Their contact patterns were assessed through their demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination status, and individual disease mitigation measures. Generalized linear models were used to identify factors associated with increased contacts. The mean number of contacts during the pandemic declined by at least 49.8% (8.2 weekday contacts and 6.0 weekend contacts per individual, adjusted by age and sex) compared to a study conducted prior to 2020. Weekdays, occupation, larger household sizes, and mask wearing were associated with a higher number of contacts. The frequency and duration of contacts were negatively associated with the issuance of COVID-19 governmental measures, yet the relative change in contacts was not as prominent as pre- and post-lockdown situations in the United Kingdom. There was a gradual increase in contacts with time and less strict public health recommendations. Yet, contacts that did not increase with uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and continuous mask wearing depict cautious behavior across the survey population during the pandemic and into 2023. These results are in contrast with European countries where contacts largely increased among vaccinated individuals compared to the non-vaccinated. Social contacts are country and context specific, highlighting the need for data collection across different communities.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

However, it remains unclear how various aspects of early life relate to dementia risk, and how they may interact with genetic predisposition.

MethodsThis study leverages data on nationally representative older adults in the United States from the Health and Retirement Study (2006-2020; N=8,676; ages [&ge;] 60 at baseline, 55% female). We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the associations of early life risk factors (financial, social, human capital deficits, adverse experiences, and childhood health conditions) and their interactions with APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype on dementia incidence.

ResultsLow early-life financial, social, and human capital, as well as childhood health conditions were associated with higher dementia risk. After adjusting for comprehensive adulthood risk factors, low social capital and human capital persisted as significant predictors, associated with 16% (95% CI=1-34%) and 21% (95% CI=6-38%) increased risks, respectively. APOE {varepsilon}4 strongly predicted dementia across all models (83-86% increased risk). Notably, significant interactions emerged between APOE {varepsilon}4 and early-life financial capital and adversity. These early life risk factors significantly increased dementia risk only among APOE {varepsilon}4 non-carriers. Carrying {varepsilon}4, however, consistently elevated risk regardless of childhood socioeconomic status or adversity exposure.

ConclusionsOur findings suggest potential direct, enduring cognitive health impacts of inadequate childhood social and human resources, and show that genetic predisposition via APOE {varepsilon}4 may overwhelm the influence of early life socioeconomic adversity, providing evidence consistent with a differential susceptibility hypothesis.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Fc receptor-like 5 (FCRL5) has emerged as an alternative target. However, resistance frequently emerges within months, posing a significant clinical challenge. Structural alterations and mutations in BCMA only account for the minority of cases and insights into BCMA antigen escape remain largely unknown. This study investigates novel (epi)genetic mechanisms of antigen escape through comprehensive multi-omic Oxford Nanopore profiling of sequential pre-treatment and relapse samples. We identify acquired DNA-hypermethylation across the entire BCMA gene, and hypermethylation of the FCRL5 promoter, both resulting in epigenetic gene silencing as novel resistance mechanisms through which MM cells evade therapy. These findings underscore the dynamic clonal evolution of MM under therapeutic pressure and highlight the critical role of epigenetic modifications in resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of advanced sequencing technologies for capturing epigenetic and complex genomic alterations in clinical settings, paving the way for personalized treatment strategies and predictive biomarkers for early resistance detection.

Statement of significanceAcquired DNA hypermethylation of BCMA and FCRL5 regulatory regions, leading to gene expression downregulation, represent novel epigenetic resistance mechanisms to anti-BCMA and anti-FCRL5 immunotherapies. Furthermore, DNA methylation marks serve as a molecular memory of therapeutic pressure, capturing the treatment history of cancer cells.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Study designRetrospective demographic analysis.

MethodsA hierarchical time-varying regression model was applied to prefectural life table data in Japan during 2000-2019. Pre-pandemic baseline mortality rates and death counts during 2020-2022 were projected by this model to evaluate the mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality during 2020-2022.

ResultsNationally, the observed mortality rates were higher than projected rates among those aged 10-29 years and lower for ages 1-9 and >80 years in 2020. During 2021 and 2022, mortality rates consistently increased for most age groups, with substantial regional heterogeneity in those aged <14 years. Consistently, the neutral gaps between the observed and projected life expectancy across prefectures in 2020 turned negative in most prefectures during 2022. In 2020, the negative gap in life expectancy ranged from a substantial shortening of -1.41 years (95% prediction interval [PI]: -1.69, -1.12) in Okinawa to a slight shortening of -0.23 years (95% PI: -0.63, 0.17) in Tottori. Excess deaths per population also grew consistently in all prefectures during 2020-2022; Miyazaki yielded the largest estimate at 186.2 (95% PI: 158.6, 214.0) per 100,000 population.

ConclusionsOur framework highlights the usefulness of life table data for evaluating the mortality impact caused by an event such as the pandemic.

Here, we sought to define the effects of partial DOT1L loss by applying bulk and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, ChIP-sequencing, imaging, multielectrode array recordings, and behavioral analysis of zebrafish and multiple mouse models.

We present a cohort of 16 individuals (12 females, 4 males) with neurodevelopmental disorders and monoallelic DOT1L variants, including a frameshift deletion, an in-frame deletion, a nonsense, and missense variants clustered in the catalytic domain. We demonstrate that specific variants cause loss of methyltransferase activity. In primary cortical neurons, Dot1l knockdown disrupts transcription of synaptic genes, neuron branching, expression of a synaptic protein, and neuronal activity. Further in the cortex of heterozygous Dot1l mice, Dot1l loss causes sex-specific transcriptional responses and H3K79me2 depletion, including within down-regulated genes. Lastly using both zebrafish and mouse models, we found behavioral disruptions that include developmental deficits and sex-specific social behavioral changes.

Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Surgical approaches to retrieve sperm from the testis are effective in some cases but can be invasive and expensive. Here we described a noninvasive ultrasound-guided rete testis (UGRT) approach to retrieve sperm from the testes or infuse stem cells into the testes of men with azoospermia.

MethodsUltrasound was used to guide insertion of a 25-gauge hypodermic needle through the base of the scrotum and into the rete testis space that is contiguous with all seminiferous tubules. Medium was infused into the rete testis and aspirated to retrieve sperm from monkeys and men (NCT03291522) with azoospermia. A peripubertal patient with osteosarcoma of the femur cryopreserved a testicular cell suspension to safeguard his future fertility (NCT02972801). He returned as a young adult (21-25 yo) survivor for autologous transplantation of his cryopreserved testicular cells, including spermatogonial stem cells, using the UGRT approach (NCT04452305).

FindingsSperm were successfully aspirated from four of six monkeys with radiation-induced azoospermia and three of three patients with obstructive azoospermia, demonstrating proficiency with the UGRT approach. Sperm were not recovered from the testes of seven patients with nonobstructive azoospermia. Semen analysis confirmed that the adult survivor of childhood cancer was azoospermic. His cryopreserved testis cells were transplanted back into one testis, with no adverse effects. After transplantation, the testicular parenchyma had a normal homogeneous appearance. Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone levels were normal. Inhibin B levels were low. The patient remains azoospermic one year after transplantation.

InterpretationWe describe a platform for proficiency training in UGRT flushing, aspiration, or injection. This provides a noninvasive option for sperm retrieval and infusing stem cells or other therapeutics into the testis.

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

ObjectiveTo systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used.

ResultsThe median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding.

Conclusions and RelevanceA substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional windlass-based tourniquets such as the Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT) present challenges in rapid application and ease of use, particularly within civilian emergency contexts. The XForce Tourniquet (XForce TQ) has been developed to address these limitations with a novel ratcheting mechanism and self-securing strap. These design features aim to improve usability and application speed while also demonstrating the XForce tourniquets ability to serve as the foundation for broader telemedicine tourniquet initiatives.

MethodsThis study conducted a comparative evaluation of the XForce TQ and CAT TQ among healthcare professionals (n = 99) using a simulated limb model (TQ Aid). Participants applied both tourniquets in three timed trials each with application times recorded at key steps. The study assessed differences in mean total application time, user performance across age and sex groups, and overall device efficiency. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA to determine significance.

ResultsThe XForce TQ significantly reduced mean total application time (8.67 {+/-} 2.12 s) compared to the CAT TQ (16.53 {+/-} 4.43 s, p < 0.001), representing a 47% reduction in total application time. Significant differences were also observed between sexes, with females taking longer to apply both tourniquets (p < 0.05). No significant differences in application time were found between age groups (p = 0.852). The ratcheting mechanism of the XForce TQ demonstrated improved user efficiency and reduced application variability.

ConclusionThe XForce TQ offers significantly faster application times than the CAT TQ, suggesting that its novel design enhances usability in emergency scenarios. These findings support the development of next-generation intelligent tourniquets integrating smart features such as automated emergency alerts and telemedicine capabilities. Further research is needed to validate its performance in real-world trauma settings.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648

The mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in patients with headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at both inclusion and after 6 months as compared to healthy controls. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated as compared with those with vaccine associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

NCT05235776

What is already known on this topicNew onset persistent headache occurs in a subset of individuals after COVID-19 and to some extent after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown.

What this study addsAltered plasma levels of soluble markers that potentially could reflect changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 with association to cognitive symptoms.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur data underscore the need for more long-time follow-up of patients with new onset headache following COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and this follow-up might also include blood tests for amyloid processing and neuroinflammation.","NA","medrxiv",1745359708648
