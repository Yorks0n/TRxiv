This review examines the trends in SCD among pilots from a global perspective, analyzing evidence from 2011 to 2023, with a focus on its growing impact as a global crisis and recent findings pointing to a potential rise in incidence, particularly after 2019.

MethodsA systematic search of peer-reviewed literature, international aviation databases, and pilot associations was conducted to identify relevant data. The analysis focused on trends in SCD prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and recent findings, including the potential impact of COVID-19, the role of vaccination, and important biomarkers to screen for predisposition.

ResultsRecent studies suggest a potential increase in SCD incidence among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular complications, increased stress, disruptions in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle may contribute to this potential rise. Biomarkers such as troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been identified as potential indicators of increased SCD risk in pilots.

ConclusionSCD remains a significant and rising threat to pilots, posing a global crisis that requires immediate attention. Through a comprehensive approach that includes risk assessment, preventive measures, emergency response, and preventive protocols, the aviation industry can mitigate this risk and safeguard the lives of pilots and passengers.

The proposed standardized examination protocol for pilots includes regular cardiovascular risk assessment, biomarker screening, monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination status, lifestyle modifications, and a standardized reporting system. The adoption of a standardized protocol by aviation regulatory bodies and airlines worldwide is crucial to address the growing threat of SCD among pilots and ensure the highest standards of aviation safety.","NA","medrxiv",1720389909947
"PAM: Predictive attention mechanism for neural decoding of visual perception","10.1101/2024.06.04.596589","biorxiv",70.75,29.7,62.9,67.25,70.75,"Dado, T.; Le, L.; van Gerven, M.; Gucluturk, Y.; Guclu, U.","Thirza Dado","Radboud University","2024-06-08","1","new results","cc_by","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/08/2024.06.04.596589.source.xml","Attention mechanisms enhance deep learning models by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input data. We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

As early studies grappled with random error and insufficient information, incongruence or lack of resolution in phylogenomics is generally associated with inadequate modeling of biological phenomena combined with analytical issues leading to systematic biases. Few phylogenomic studies, however, explore the potential for random error or establish an expectation of what level of resolution should be expected from a given empirical dataset. In presenting incongruent results, phylogeneticists face a choice of providing a diverse array of results from different approaches or a single preferred tree, with few attempting to integrate uncertainties across methods. Recent phylogenetic work has uncovered many well-supported and often novel relationships, as well as more contentious findings, across the phylogeny of ants. Ants are the most species-rich lineage of social insects and among the most ecologically important terrestrial animals. As a result, they have attracted much research, including regarding systematics. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive genus-level phylogeny of the ants inferred using genomic data combined with an effort to evaluate signal and incongruence throughout. Here we provide deeper insight into and quantify uncertainty across the ant tree of life. We accomplish this with the most taxonomically comprehensive Ultraconserved Elements dataset to date, including 277 (81%) of recognized ant genera from all 16 extant subfamilies, representing over 98% of described species-level diversity. We use simulations to establish expectations for resolution, identify branches with less-than-expected concordance, and dissect the effects of data and model selection on recalcitrant nodes. We also construct a consensus tree integrating uncertainty from multiple analyses. Simulations show that hundreds of loci are needed to resolve recalcitrant nodes on our genus-level ant phylogeny, even under a best-case scenario of known model parameters and without systematic bias. This demonstrates that random error continues to play a role in phylogenomics. Our analyses provide a comprehensive picture of support and incongruence across the ant phylogeny, and our consensus topology is congruent with a recent phylogenomic study on the subfamily-level, while rendering a more realistic picture of uncertainty and significantly expanding generic sampling. We use this topology for divergence dating and find that assumptions about root age have significant impact on the dates inferred. Our results suggest that improved understanding of ant phylogeny will require both more data and better phylogenetic models. We also provide a workflow to identify under-supported nodes in concatenation analyses, outline a pragmatic way to reconcile conflicting results in phylogenomics, and introduce a user-friendly locus selection tool for divergence dating.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

The huge number of scientific articles using the term arousal ([~]50.000) highlights the importance of the concept, but also explains why such a vast literature had never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Methods: A total of 7361 asymptomatic community-dwelling people enrolled in the Test Us at Home parent study between October 2021 and February 2022. Participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing every 24-48 hours for 10-14 days, regardless of symptom or infection status. Participants who had no history of COVID-19 at enrollment and who were subsequently found to have at least 1 positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the parent study were recontacted in August 2023 and asked whether they had experienced long COVID, defined as the development of new symptoms lasting 3 months or longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participant's cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads, and slopes of viral clearance were modeled using post-nadir viral loads. Using a log binomial model with the modeled slopes as the exposure, we calculated the relative risk of subsequently developing long COVID with 1-2 symptoms, 3-4 symptoms, or 5+ symptoms, adjusting for age, number of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of individual long COVID symptoms based on viral clearance was also calculated. Results: 172 participants were eligible for analyses, and 59 (34.3%) reported experiencing long COVID. The risk of long COVID with 3-4 symptoms and 5+ symptoms increased by 2.44 times (aRR: 2.44; 95% CI: 0.88-6.82) and 4.97 times (aRR: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.90-13.0) per viral load slope-unit increase, respectively. Participants who developed long COVID had significantly longer times from peak viral load to viral clearance during acute disease than those who never developed long COVID (8.65 [95% CI: 8.28-9.01] vs. 10.0 [95% CI: 9.25-10.8]). The slope of viral clearance was significantly positively associated with long COVID symptoms of fatigue (aRR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.22-6.69), brain fog (aRR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.21-11.0), shortness of breath (aRR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.24-20.6), and gastrointestinal symptoms (aRR: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.54-19.3). Discussion: We observed that longer time from peak viral load to viral RNA clearance during acute COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. Further, slower clearance rates were associated with greater number of symptoms of long COVID. These findings suggest that early viral-host dynamics are mechanistically important in the subsequent development of long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1720389909947

Twelve studies have evaluated psychedelic effects on fMRI brain entropy quantifications, no findings have been replicated. Here we evaluated these metrics in an independent 28-participant healthy cohort with 121 pre- and post-psilocybin fMRI scans. We assessed relations between brain entropy and plasma psilocin, brain serotonin 2A receptor occupancy, and a subjective drug intensity rating using linear mixed-effects models. We observed significant positive associations for Shannon entropy of path-length, instantaneous correlation distributions, and divergent associations of sample entropy at varying time-scales. We did not observe significant effects for 8 of 13 entropy metrics. Brain entropy quantifications showed limited inter-measure correlations. Our observations support a nuanced acute psychedelic effect on brain entropy, underscoring the need for replication and that these metrics do not reflect a singular construct. Our findings highlight candidate brain entropy metrics that may mediate clinical effects of psychedelics.","NA","medrxiv",1720389909947

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Most miniaturized neural interfaces require a wired connection for external power and data acquisition systems. The wires are required to be commutated through a slip ring to accommodate for twisting of the wire or tether and alleviate torsional stresses. The increased trend towards long term continuous neural recordings have spurred efforts to realize active commutators that can sense the torsional stress and actively rotation the slip ring to alleviate torsional stresses. Current solutions however require addition of sensing modules. Here we report on an active translating commutator that uses computer vision (CV) algorithms on behavioral imaging videos captured during the experiment to track the animals position and heading direction in real-time and uses this information to control the translation and rotation of a slipring commutator to accommodate for accumulated mouse heading orientation changes and position. The CV guided active commutator has been extensively tested in three separate behavioral contexts and we show reliable cortex-wide imaging in a mouse in an open-field with a miniaturized widefield cortical imaging device. Active commutation resulted in no changes to measured neurophysiological signals. The active commutator is fully open source, can be assembled using readily available off-the-shelf components, and is compatible with a wide variety of miniaturized neurophotonic and neurophysiology devices.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Traditionally, miniscopes have only been able to record from a single fluorescence wavelength. Here, we present a new open-source dual-channel Miniscope that simultaneously records two wavelengths in freely behaving animals, providing more flexibility and function. To enable simultaneous acquisition of two fluorescent wavelengths, we incorporated two CMOS sensors with two independent sets of emission filters into a single Miniscope. This enables us to acquire images at the full frame rate that the CMOS sensor supports while simultaneously eliminating crosstalk between channels, which allows imaging fluorophores that heavily overlap in their emission spectrums (for example, GFP and tdTomato). We adopted a design that enables adjusting the position of one imaging sensor along the light path to match the focal plane of the other sensor, providing additional flexibility for calibration. To validate our dual-channel Miniscope in vivo, we imaged hippocampal CA1 region that co-expressed a dynamic calcium indicator (GCaMP) and a static nuclear signal (constitutively active tdTomato) while mice ran on a linear track. We used GCaMP signals to investigate spatial coding in the hippocampus and tdTomato signals as a landmark for registration of neurons across recording sessions. Our results suggest that, even when neurons were registered across recording sessions using tdTomato signals, hippocampal spatial coding changes over time as previously reported. In conclusion, our novel dual-channel Miniscope enables imaging of two fluorescence wavelengths in the same focal plane with minimal crosstalk between the two channels, opening the doors to a multitude of new experimental possibilities.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Predictive processing theories posit that psychedelics work by loosening priors or high-level beliefs, including ingrained biases that have become pathological, leading to shifts in bottom-up vs top-down information processing that reconfigure perception, cognition, and mood. Because 5-HT2A receptors, the primary target of psychedelics, are enriched in visual cortices, we investigated whether psychedelics alter visual processing in a manner consistent with predictive processing theories. People who recently (<3 weeks) used 5-HT2A-agonist psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) exhibited slowed response latencies and increased cortical involvement in generating saccades to targets in predictable locations, along with a generalization of sensory prediction errors (i.e., deviance detection) during passive visual processing. Individuals who recently used a 5-HT1A-selective psychedelic (5-MeO-DMT) displayed similar changes in saccade production, but unaltered deviance detection, suggesting circuit-specific effects. Mice administered DOI (5-HT2A-agonist) exhibited altered deviance detection within primary visual cortex (V1), along with weakened top-down feedback to V1 from higher cortical area ACa. These results concord with the hypothesis that psychedelics shift the balance from top-down to bottom-up in sensory cortical circuits -- an effect that persists beyond the acute exposure period.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we investigated the fate of decoupled cells during culture observations and we compared the transcriptome profiling and the cellular architecture in three dimensions of the three cell types. We found that decoupled cells can revert to the calcified form in the absence of viral pressure, revealing the transient nature of this cell type. Ultrastructural analyses showed distinct nuclear organisation with variations in chromatin volume. Transcriptomic analyses revealed gene expression patterns specific to each life phase. These included multiple regulatory functions in chromatin remodelling, broader epigenetic mechanisms and life cycling, which likely contributed to cell differentiation. Finally, the exploration of available host-virus transcriptomes supports life cycle transition during viral infection. This study provides cellular and molecular foundations for nuclear remodelling and cell differentiation in coccolithophores and the identification of gene markers for studying coccolithophore life cycles in natural populations.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Hodarchaeales (Asgardarchaeota class Heimdallarchaeia) were recently shown to be the closest relatives of eukaryotes. However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Full-field flicker also evokes perception of hallucinatory geometric patterns, which mathematical models explain as standing-wave formations emerging from periodic forcing at resonant frequencies of the simulated neural network. However, empirical evidence for such flicker-induced standing waves in the visual cortex was missing. We recorded cortical responses to flicker in awake mice using high spatial resolution widefield imaging in combination with high temporal resolution glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR). The temporal frequency tuning curves in the mouse V1 were similar to those observed in humans, showing a banded structure with multiple resonance peaks (8 Hz, 15 Hz, 33 Hz). Spatially, all flicker frequencies evoked responses in V1 corresponding to retinotopic stimulus location, but some evoked additional peaks. These flicker-induced cortical patterns displayed standing wave characteristics and matched linear wave equation solutions in an area restricted to the visual cortex. Taken together, the interaction of traveling waves with cortical area boundaries leads to spatiotemporal activity patterns that may affect perception.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we introduce CarboTag, a modular toolbox for live functional imaging of plant walls. CarboTag relies on a small molecular motif, a pyridine boronic acid, that targets its cargo to the cell wall, is non-toxic and ensures rapid tissue permeation. We designed a suite of cell wall imaging probes based on CarboTag in any desired color for multiplexing. Moreover, we created new functional reporters for live quantitative imaging of key cell wall features: network porosity, cell wall pH and the presence of reactive oxygen species. CarboTag opens the way to dynamical and quantitative mapping of cell wall responses at subcellular resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely-related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the Drosophila taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses, and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food texture and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate textures. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Using whole animal screens in genetically engineered mouse models of cancer we have identified circulating metabolites associated with metastasis. Specifically, we highlight the pyrimidine uracil as a prominent metastasis-associated metabolite. Uracil is generated by neutrophils expressing the enzyme uridine phosphorylase-1 (UPP1), and neutrophil specific Upp1 expression is increased in cancer. Altered UPP1 activity influences expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, leading to decreased neutrophil motility in the pre-metastatic lung. Furthermore, we find that UPP1-expressing neutrophils suppress T-cell proliferation, and the UPP1 product uracil can increase fibronectin deposition in the extracellular microenvironment. Consistently, knockout or inhibition of UPP1 in mice with mammary tumours increases the number of T-cells and reduces fibronectin content in the lung and decreases the proportion of mice that develop lung metastasis. These data indicate that UPP1 influences neutrophil behaviour and extracellular matrix deposition in the lung and suggest that pharmacological targeting of this pathway could be an effective strategy to reduce metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Condensates can be two- or multi-phase systems defined by coexisting dense and dilute phases. Here, we show that solution ions can partition asymmetrically across coexisting phases defined by condensates formed by intrinsically disordered proteins or homopolymeric RNA molecules. Our findings were enabled by direct measurements of the activities of cations and anions within coexisting phases of protein and RNA condensates. Asymmetries in ion partitioning between coexisting phases vary with protein sequence, condensate type, salt concentration, and ion type. The Donnan equilibrium set up by asymmetrical partitioning of solution ions generates interphase electric potentials known as Donnan and Nernst potentials. Our measurements show that the interphase potentials of condensates are of the same order of magnitude as membrane potentials of membrane-bound organelles. Interphase potentials quantify the degree to which microenvironments of coexisting phases are different from one another. Importantly, and based on condensate-specific interphase electric potentials, which are membrane-like potentials of membraneless bodies, we reason that condensates are mesoscale capacitors that store charge. Interphase potentials lead to electric double layers at condensate interfaces. This helps explain recent observations of condensate interfaces being electrochemically active.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

In this study, we have investigated the natural neonatal development of the mucus barrier and sentinel goblet cell-dependent secretory responses upon postnatal colonization. Combined in vivo and ex vivo analyses of pre- and post-weaning colonic mucus barrier and sentinel goblet cell maturation demonstrated a sequential microbiota-dependent development of these primary and secondary goblet cell-intrinsic protective functions, with dynamic changes in mucus processing dependent on innate immune signalling via MyD88, and development of functional sentinel goblet cells dependent on the NADPH/Dual oxidase family member Duox2. Our findings therefore identify new mechanisms of microbiota-goblet cell regulatory interaction and highlight the critical importance of the pre-weaning period for the normal development of colonic barrier function.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

After inoculation with inactivated COVID-19 vaccine (Vero Cell) at gestational day 14.5, antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were detected in serum of both dams and pups. At one month of age, pups born to vaccinated dams, but not the offspring of non-vaccinated dams, exhibited greater working memory and more neural cell proliferation, neuroblast formation, neuronal stem cell activity and larger numbers of mature neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG). Luminex multiplex assay revealed elevated levels of hippocampal cytokines/chemokines critical to neurogenesis and memory function, namely interferon-{gamma} [IFN-{gamma}] and CX3C motif chemokine ligand 1 [CX3CL1]. Conditional knockout technology implicated microglial IFN-{gamma} receptor 1 (IFN{gamma}R1) and CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) as crucial intercellular participants in the neuronal developmental process, via regulating microglial activation and chemotaxis, respectively.

Members of Brassicaceae family employ a ""lock and key"" mechanism involving stigmatic (sRALFs) and pollen RALFs (pRALFs) binding to FERONIA, a Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) receptor, to establish a prezygotic hybridization barrier. In the absence of compatible pRALFs, sRALFs bind to FERONIA, inducing a lock state for pollen tube penetration. Conversely, compatible pRALFs act as a key, facilitating successful fertilization. Competing pRALFs reduce the sRALFs binding to FERONIA in a dose-dependent manner, enabling pollen tube penetration. Despite its crucial role in Brassicaceae hybridization, the structural basis of this binding remains elusive owing to the highly flexible nature of RALF peptides. Using advanced structural modeling techniques and flexible peptide molecular docking, this study reveals that pRALFs and sRALFs bind to negatively charged pockets in FERONIA with varying binding affinities. Our study unveils the structural basis of this binding, shedding light on the molecular mechanism underlying hybridization barriers in Brassicaceae.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

A passive adaptation of protein degradation and dilution rates operates in cells tightly coupling proliferation rate to protein synthesis rates, allowing to partially buffer changes in proteome concentrations with increased loss of short-lived proteins. In contrast, the proliferation rate of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is hyposensitive to moderate changes in protein synthesis. mESCs uncouple protein degradation and dilution rates and robustly maintain their protein levels.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, as in most flowering plants, the first zygotic cell division is asymmetric, giving rise to the embryo proper and an extraembryonic suspensor. Zygotic polarization and differential cell identities in the daughter cells are controlled by the ERECTA-YODA pathway, a prototype receptor kinase-MAP kinase signaling pathway. This pathway also controls asymmetric cell divisions in the epidermis during stomatal development. In this context, the bHLH transcription factor ICE1/SCRM is a direct target of MPK3/6, and phosphorylation negatively controls SCRM activity by targeting the protein for proteasomal degradation. This raises the question if this regulatory module is also involved in the asymmetric division of the zygote. Our results show that SCRM has a critical function in zygote polarization and acts in parallel with the known MPK3/6 target WRKY2 in activating the homeobox transcription factor gene WOX8. Our work further demonstrates that SCRM activity in the early embryo is positively controlled by MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation. Therefore, the mode of MAP kinase regulation of the same target protein fundamentally differs between the embryo and the epidermis, shedding light on cell type-specific, differential gene regulation by common signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Methods: We analysed cohorts of population-wide registries of young individuals from Norway (N=1,986,970) and Sweden (N=2,100,188). We used regression models to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRR), treating exposures as time-varying, starting 30 days after registered SARS-CoV-2 positive test or vaccination. Results: Pooled results from Norway and Sweden and age-groups 12-17 and 18-29 years showed no significant increase in type 1 diabetes after documented infections (aRR 1.06, 95%CI:0.77-1.45). There was moderate heterogeneity, with a suggestive increased risk among children in Norway after infection.

The concepts of grammar and semantics from natural language have been shown to be applicable to understanding functional properties of viral proteins like antigenicity. Here, we investigate how these representations more broadly enable assessment of both observed and previously unobserved variation due to mutation. Applied to SARS-CoV-2's spike protein we demonstrate the PLM, ESM-2, has learned the sequence context within which variation occurs, capturing evolutionary constraint. We demonstrate this recapitulates what conventionally requires MSA data predicting both where variation does and does not accumulate across the protein. We show the PLM-derived measures of amino acid change represent novel metrics as they do not correlate strongly with classical metrics of change in sequences. Applied to SARS-CoV-2 variants across the pandemic we demonstrate that ESM-2 representations encode the relatedness between variants, i.e., their evolutionary history, as well as the distinct nature of variants of concern upon their emergence, associated with shifts in receptor binding and antigenicity. This application of ESM-2 can be used for characterising the evolutionary potential and possible epidemiological impact of both existing and emerging variation, with the potential to be applied to any protein sequence, pathogen or otherwise.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

We show that the toxSAS FaRel2 inspects the tRNA acceptor stem to specifically select tRNAGly and tRNAThr. The 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th base pairs the stem act as the specificity determinants. We show that the toxSASs PhRel2 and CapRelSJ46 differ in tRNA specificity from FaRel2, and rationalise this through structural modelling: while the universal 3'-CCA end element slots into a highly conserved CCA recognition groove, the acceptor stem recognition region is variable across toxSAS diversity. As phages use tRNA isoacceptors to overcome tRNA-targeting defences, we hypothesise that highly evolvable modular tRNA recognition allows for the escape of viral countermeasures through rapid tRNA substrate specificity switching.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

This variant not only maintains viral fitness in chickens but also facilitates the aerosol transmission of AIVs between ferrets. Mechanistically, PB2-627V utilizes both avian and human host protein ANP32A to support viral polymerase function.

Here, we investigated the conjugation machinery of protein ATG8ylation in CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knockout human cell lines, utilizing a deconjugation-resistant (Q116P G120) form of MAP1LC3B.

However, the microbial communities associated within these stems (the  caulosphere) and their contribution to biogeochemical cycling of methane and other compounds remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that specialised microbial communities inhabit the bark of multiple Australian tree species and actively mediate the cycling of methane, hydrogen, and other climate-active trace gases. Based on genome-resolved metagenomics, most bark-associated bacteria are hydrogen metabolisers and facultative fermenters, adapted to dynamic redox and substrate conditions. Over three quarters of assembled genomes encoded genes for hydrogen metabolism, including novel lineages of Acidobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota, and the candidate phylum JAJYCY01. Methanotrophs such as Methylomonas were abundant in certain trees and coexisted with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Methanobacterium. Bark-associated microorganisms mediated aerobic oxidation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane at concentrations seen in planta, but under anoxic conditions barks could become a significant source of these gases. Field-based experiments and upscaling analysis suggested that bark communities are quantitatively significant mediators of global biogeochemical cycling, mitigating climatically-active gas emissions from stems and contributing to the net terrestrial sink of atmospheric hydrogen. These findings highlight the caulosphere as an important new research frontier for understanding microbial gas cycling and biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

In an attempt to modify branch orientation, growers use many different management practices, including tying branches to wires or applying growth regulator sprays. However, these practices are often costly and ineffective. In contrast, altering the expression of genes that control branch angles and orientations would permanently optimize tree architecture with minimal management inputs. One gene implicated in branch angle control is LAZY1, which promotes upward branch growth in response to gravity. We used an antisense vector to silence LAZY1 in plum (Prunus domestica). We found that these LAZY1-silenced lines have significantly increased branch and petiole angles. In addition, they lack apical dominance and display a wandering or weeping branch trajectory. Given these phenotypes, we assessed whether the strength or stiffness of the branches were compromised. No differences were observed in new growth. While the wood of first-year LAZY1-silenced branches was more flexible and weaker than the control, the strength and stiffness of the branches were not decreased because branch diameter is increased. Finally, we evaluated the utility of LAZY1-silenced trees for two planar orchard systems, training them in super slender axe and espalier. LAZY1-silenced trees had more open canopies and were easier to constrain to the trellis height. This work illustrates the power of manipulating gene expression to optimize plant architecture for horticultural applications.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Although many competitive interactions have been characterized, molecular adaptations that can counter this antagonism and preserve or increase fitness remain underexplored. Here, we characterize the adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to pyocyanin, a redox-active interspecies antimicrobial produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a co-infecting pathogen frequently isolated from wound and chronic lung infections with S. aureus. Using experimental evolution, we identified mutations in a conserved global transcriptional regulator, CodY, that confer tolerance to pyocyanin and thereby enhance survival of S. aureus. The transcriptional response of a pyocyanin tolerant CodY mutant to pyocyanin indicated a two-pronged defensive response compared to the wild type. Firstly, the CodY mutant strongly suppressed metabolism, by downregulating pathways associated with core metabolism, especially translation-associated genes, upon exposure to pyocyanin. Metabolic suppression via ATP depletion was sufficient to provide comparable protection against pyocyanin to the wild-type strain. Secondly, while both the wild-type and CodY mutant strains upregulated oxidative stress response pathways, the CodY mutant overexpressed multiple stress response genes compared to the wild type. We determined that catalase overexpression was critical to pyocyanin tolerance as its absence eliminated tolerance in the CodY mutant and overexpression of catalase was sufficient to impart tolerance to the wild-type strain. Together, these results suggest that both transcriptional responses likely contribute to pyocyanin tolerance in the CodY mutant. Our data thus provide new mechanistic insight into adaptation toward interbacterial antagonism via altered regulation that facilitates multifaceted protective cellular responses.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

However, the structural details of CR assembly and the explanation for several ALS-associated variants' impact on phase separation and function remain unclear due to challenges in analyzing the dynamic association of TDP-43 CTD using traditional structural biology approaches. By employing an integrative approach, combining biophysical experiments, biochemical assays, AlphaFold2-Multimer (AF2-Multimer), and atomistic simulations, we generated structural models of helical oligomerization of TDP-43 CR. Using NMR, we first established that the native state of TDP-43 CR under physiological conditions is -helical. Next, alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that while hydrophobic residues in the CR are important for CR assembly, phase separation and TDP-43 nuclear retention function, polar residues down regulate these processes.

Although such genomic differences are thought to make key contributions to distinctly modern human traits, experimental validation of their potential impact was so far restricted to functional assays and model organisms. With the availability of large-scale genetically informative population databases, it now becomes possible to identify present-day carriers of rare archaic alleles of interest and to directly assess putative phenotypic consequences in living humans. We queried exome sequencing data of around half a million people in the UK Biobank in search of carriers of archaic alleles at 37 genomic positions with supposedly fixed human-specific changes. This search yielded 103 carriers of the archaic allele for 17 positions, with diverging allele counts across ancestries. We contrasted carriers of an exemplary archaic allele in SSH2 with a curated set of non-carriers, observing no deviation from the norm in a range of health, psychological, and cognitive traits. We also identified 62 carriers of the archaic allele of a missense change in the TKTL1 gene, previously reported to have large effects on cortical neurogenesis based on functional analyses in brain organoids and animal models. However, human carriers of the archaic TKTL1 allele did not show differences in anatomical brain measures and qualification level, compared to non-carriers. These results highlight the importance of investigating diverse ancestral populations for a more accurate representation of shared human variation and challenge the notion of permanently fixed genetic changes that set Homo sapiens apart from Neandertals and Denisovans. Lastly, we propose that future investigations should assess effects of multiple archaic alleles in aggregate, since any single genetic change is unlikely to itself explain the emergence of complex human traits.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

To investigate the expression dynamics of TEs during human early development, we used long-read sequence data generated from in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm lineages to construct lineage-specific transcriptome assemblies and accurately place TE sequences in their transcript context. Our analysis revealed that specific TE types, such as LINEs and LTRs, exhibit distinct expression patterns across different lineages. Notably, an expression outburst was observed in the ectoderm lineage, with multiple TE types showing dynamic expression trajectories. Additionally, certain LTRs, including HERVH and LTR7Y, were highly expressed in hPSCs and endodermal cells, but these HERVH and LTR7Y sequences originated from completely different transcripts. Interestingly, TE-containing transcripts exhibit distinct levels of transcript stability and subcellular localization across different lineages. Moreover, we showed a consistent trend of increased chromatin association of TE-containing transcripts in germ lineage cells compared to hPSCs. This study suggests that TEs contribute to human embryonic development through dynamic chromatin interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Given that whole-body regeneration shares the same end-point - formation of a functional body plan - as embryonic development, it has been proposed that regeneration likely recapitulates developmental processes to some extent. Therefore, understanding how developmental processes are reactivated during regeneration is important for uncovering the evolutionary history of regeneration. Comparative transcriptomic studies in some species have revealed shared gene expression between development and regeneration, but it is not known whether these shared expression profiles correspond to shared functions, and which mechanisms activate expression of developmental genes during regeneration. We sought to address these questions using the acoel Hofstenia miamia, which is amenable to studies of both embryonic development and whole-body regeneration. By examining functionally validated regeneration processes during development at single-cell resolution, we found that whereas patterning and cellular differentiation are largely similar, wound response programs have distinct dynamics between development and regeneration. Chromatin accessibility analyses revealed that regardless of playing concordant or divergent roles during regeneration and development, genes expressed in both processes are frequently controlled by the same regulatory regions, potentially via utilization of distinct transcription factor binding sites. This study extends the known correspondence of development and regeneration from broad transcriptomic similarity to include patterning and differentiation processes. Further, our work provides a catalog of regulatory regions and binding sites that potentially regulate developmental genes during regeneration, fueling comparative studies of regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

The method can be applied with data from a single individual, is unbiased even under low single nucleotide variant densities and does not necessitate any demographic or evolutionary assumptions. We apply the method to gene conversion events observed directly in Pacbio HiFI read data from a human sperm sample and find that human gene conversion tracts are shorter (mean of 50 base pairs) than estimates from yeast or Drosophila. We also estimate that typical human male gametes undergo on average 280 non-crossover events where approximately 7 are expected to become visible as gene conversions moving variants from one donor haplotype to an acceptor haplotype.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

In particular, the effect of walking upon perceptual and cognitive functions has recently been investigated in the context of how common voluntary actions may dynamically impact upon visual detection. This work has revealed that walking can enhance peripheral visual processing, and that during walking, performance on a visual detection task oscillates through good and bad periods within the phases of the stride-cycle. Here, we extend this work by examining whether oscillations in visual detection performance are uniform across the visual field while walking. Participants monitored parafoveal (~3.7 d.v.a) and peripheral (~7 d.v.a) locations left/right of fixation for the onset of targets while walking at a natural pace in wireless virtual reality. For targets at all locations accuracy, reaction times and response likelihood oscillated within each individual's stride-cycle, at primarily 2 or 4 cycles per stride. Importantly, oscillations in accuracy and reaction time shared the same frequency at both locations but were decreased in amplitude and phase-lagged in the periphery, revealing an interaction between visual field locations and oscillations in performance. Together, these results demonstrate that oscillations in visual performance entrained by the stride-cycle occur with unique amplitudes and phases across the visual field.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Neural replay of task representations is a candidate mechanism by which the brain learns such relational information or samples from a learned model in the service of adaptive behavior. Here, we tested whether cortical reactivation is related to learning higher-order sequential relationships without consciousness. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling revealed that participants acquired multi-step transition knowledge through gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model, although half of participants did not indicate conscious knowledge about the sequential task structure. To investigate neural replay, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns during brief 10 seconds pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task. We found evidence for backward sequential replay of multi-step sequences in visual cortical areas. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task, and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we examined the effect of hypoxia on cCE and its function in regulating the substrate lncRNAs. Hypoxia induces expression of cCE in HIF1 dependent manner as evidenced by Chromatin immunoprecipitation and HIF1 inhibitor experiments.

The locus coeruleus (LC) powerfully promotes arousal by releasing noradrenaline. We found that noradrenaline transmission is reduced by prolonged wakefulness and restored during sleep. Fiber-photometry imaging of noradrenaline using its biosensor showed that its release evoked by optogenetic LC neuron activation was strongly attenuated by three hours of sleep deprivation and restored during subsequent sleep. This is accompanied by the reduction and recovery of the wake-promoting effect of the LC neurons. The reduction of both LC evoked noradrenaline release and wake-inducing potency is activity dependent, and the rate of noradrenaline transmission recovery depends on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. The decline and recovery of noradrenaline transmission also occur in spontaneous sleep-wake cycles on a timescale of minutes. Together, these results reveal an essential role of sleep in restoring transmission of a key arousal-promoting neuromodulator.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

The ability to reconstruct neural circuits, and even entire nervous systems, at the neuron and synapse level, facilitates the study of the design principles of neural systems and their developmental plan. Here, we investigate the developing connectome of C. elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally-observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Validation of our models predictions of the synaptic connections using multiple reconstructions of adult worms suggests that our model identified the fundamental ""backbone"" of the connectivity graph. The accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

One of the factors thought to be essential for AMP potency is their conformational flexibility, but characterizing the diverse conformational states of AMPs experimentally remains challenging. Here we introduce a method for characterising the conformational flexibility of AMPs and provide new insights into how the interplay between conformation and aggregation in synergistic AMP combinations yields emergent properties. We use unsupervised learning and molecular dynamics simulations to show that mixing two AMPs from the Winter Flounder family (pleurocidin (WF2) \& WF1a) constrains their conformational space, reducing the number of distinct conformations adopted by the peptides, most notably for WF2. The aggregation behaviour of the peptides is also altered, favouring the formation of higher-order aggregates upon mixing. Critically, the interaction between WF1a and WF2 influences the distribution of WF2 conformations within aggregates, revealing how WF1a can modulate WF2 behaviour. Our work paves the way for deeper understanding of the synergy between AMPs, a fundamental process in nature.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Phylogenetic analysis of USUV in the three years following its initial detection in 2020 indicated that the virus is overwintering in the UK. In 2023, USUV was identified outside Greater London for the first time. Therefore, USUV should now be considered endemic within southeast England. Surveillance of avian hosts and mosquito vectors has been insufficient to elucidate the mechanism by which USUV has persisted through temperate winters. It is likely that mosquitoes play a significant role in facilitating the establishment of USUV in temperate areas, as is the case for related mosquito-borne viruses. Here we undertake enhanced targeted vector surveillance at the index site to investigate the role of mosquitoes in facilitating USUV establishment in the UK. Between 2021 and 2024 inclusive, we detected USUV in host-seeking adult female Culex pipiens s.l. (n = 8/554 pools), a key vector of the virus in Europe. During 2023, enhanced surveillance detected transovarial transmission of USUV in wild Cx. pipiens s.l. (n = 1/202 pools), by screening adults following captive rearing of mosquito larvae collected from the field. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of vertical transmission of USUV in an arthropod vector. Consequently, transovarial transmission should be considered a viable mechanism for the persistence of USUV in temperate areas. Our results highlight the importance of undertaking detailed vector surveillance, across life stages, to inform the epidemiology of vector-borne viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

In this manuscript, we use transgenic cilia reporter mice and an intravital imaging approach to quantitate primary cilia dynamics as it occurs in live mouse pancreatic islets. We validate this imaging workflow as suitable for studying islet cilia motion in real time in vivo and demonstrate that glucose stimulation corresponds to a change in cilia motility, which may be a physiologic measure of nutrient-dependent fluxes in islet cell function.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

During this period, the influence of select components of maternal diet on offspring microbiota and health remains largely unknown. To investigate the potential transgenerational impact of maternal exposure to microbiota-disrupting factors, dams were subjected prior breeding to dietary emulsifiers, known to directly perturb the microbiota. Such maternal exposure induced early-life microbiota alterations in offspring which associated with long-lasting susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and intestinal inflammation. These detrimental effects were entirely prevented by early-life microbiota normalization through cross-fostering procedures. Mechanistically, maternal emulsifier exposure induces strong offspring impairment in goblet cells-mediated host-microbiota communication which is central in driving the observed long-lasting deleterious effects. To conclude, this study underscores the central role played by maternal intake of microbiota-disrupting agents on the next generation microbiota, with long lasting consequences for intestinal and metabolic health.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

In Drosophila melanogaster, the inhibition of autophagy, specifically in adult intestinal stem cells (ISCs), affects their number differently through aging. Appropriate intestinal renewal requires a balance between ISC proliferation and differentiation. Herein, we show that in adult ISCs, the loss of core autophagy genes and regulators of autophagosome-lysosome fusion increased the enteroendocrine cell population and transcriptional activity of Stat92E. Functional experiments with cell fate regulators involved in enteroendocrine or enterocyte differentiation or proliferation suggested that dysfunctional autophagy in adult ISCs enhanced Stat92E activity downstream of Hop/JAK kinase. Finally, lineage-tracing analyses confirmed that autophagy inhibition autonomously promotes enteroendocrine cell differentiation without affecting enterocyte differentiation. Thus, our data demonstrates that, under homeostatic conditions, basal autophagy limits enteroendocrine cell differentiation by controlling Stat92E activity.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

To investigate signaling pathways involved in stomatal closure, we performed a phosphoproteomic analysis of ABA-treated Arabidopsis guard cell protoplasts (GCPs). From this analysis, we discovered that MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN 4 KINASE 1 (MAP4K1) is phosphorylated in response to ABA. Subsequent biochemical assays showed that Ser-479 of MAP4K1 is directly phosphorylated by SRK2E (OST1/SnRK2.6), a protein kinase that plays a central role in ABA-induced responses. Mutational analyses of MAP4K1, as well as closely related MAP4K2, revealed that both kinases positively regulate ABA-induced stomatal closure, and that Ser-479 of MAP4K1 was required for this phenotype. In map4k1map4k2, stomatal closure was induced by exogenous Ca2+ but not H2O2. Furthermore, electrophysiology experiments showed that MAP4K1/2 are required for ABA-dependent activation of Ca2+-permeable channels in GCPs.

Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Understanding glial-glial and glial-neuronal interactions is essential for unraveling the complexities of brain function and developing treatments for neurological disorders. To explore these interactions between human neural cells within an intact brain environment, we employe a co-transplantation strategy involving the engraftment of hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells along with primitive macrophage progenitors into the neonatal mouse brain. This approach creates human-mouse chimeric brains containing human microglia, macroglia (astroglia and oligodendroglia), and neurons. Using super-resolution imaging and 3D reconstruction techniques, we examine the dynamics between human neurons and glia, unveiling human microglia engulfing immature human neurons, microglia pruning synapses of human neurons, and significant interactions between human oligodendrocytes and neurons. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of the chimeric brain uncovers a close recapitulation of the human glial progenitor cell population, along with a dynamic stage in astroglial development that mirrors the processes found in the human brain. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analysis highlights significant neuronal-glial and glial-glial interactions, especially the interaction between adhesion molecules neurexins and neuroligins. This innovative co-transplantation model opens up new avenues for exploring the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying human neurological diseases. It holds particular promise for studying disorders where glial-neuronal interactions and non-cell-autonomous effects play crucial roles.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we explore whether these advances can be adapted to drug discovery by addressing the problem of prospective validation - the assessment of the performance of a method on out-of-distribution data. First, we tested whether k-fold n-step forward cross-validation could improve the accuracy of out-of-distribution small molecule bioactivity predictions. We found that it is more helpful than conventional random split cross-validation in describing the accuracy of a model in real-world drug discovery settings. We also analyzed discovery yield and novelty error, finding that these two metrics provide an understanding of the applicability domain of models and an assessment of their ability to predict molecules with desirable bioactivity compared to other small molecules. Based on these results, we recommend incorporating a k-fold n-step forward cross-validation and these metrics when building state-of-the-art models for bioactivity prediction in drug discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we investigated the phagocytic process through individual gene silencing using a druggable gene library. Our study demonstrates that astrocyte-mediated synapse engulfment is regulated by the Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (Ackr3). Mechanistically, we have shown that Ackr3 recognizes phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-bound Cxcl12 at synaptic terminals both in vitro and in cell culture thus serving as a novel marker of synaptic dysfunction. Notably, both the receptor and its ligand are overexpressed in post-mortem AD human brains, and downregulation of the receptor in AD mouse models (5xFAD) significantly diminishes astrocyte-mediated synaptic elimination. Overall, this work unveils a novel, possibly targetable mechanism of astrocyte-mediated synaptic engulfment implicated in the most common neurodegenerative disease.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

The expression of inhibitory receptors (IRs) may limit vaccine efficacy by reducing specific effector functions in vaccine-induced T-cells. Recently, the clinical use of antibodies targeting IRs or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated remarkable success in cancer remission. Therefore, there is a potential benefit of using ICB in PWH to improve the effectiveness of vaccine-induced T-cell responses. Here, we evaluated functional changes in vaccine-induced HIV-specific CD8+; T-cell responses by in-vitro PD-1 and TIM-3 blockade during immune stimulation in PWH early ART-treated and vaccinated (Etvac). We compared Etvac to PWH early ART-treated (Et) and chronic ART-treated PWH (Chro). Our results demonstrate a significant increase in the functional responses of vaccine-induced HIV-1-specific CD8+; T-cells upon PD-1 but not TIM-3 blockade in cellular proliferation, IFNgamma production, and activation. Although no effect was found in Et, similar findings were obtained in HIV-1-specific CD8+; T-cells in Chro for combined PD-1/TIM-3 blockade. Moreover, we identify in Etvac a direct association between PD-1 expression in CD8+ T cells and in vitro response to anti-PD-1 treatment. Our findings support the potential adjuvant effect of PD-1 blockade to improve HIV-1 therapeutic vaccine efficacy in early ART-treated PWH for future human studies.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans. Furthermore, hippocampal activity scaled with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans.

Mobile integrons spread antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, while the sedentary chromosomal integrons contain up to hundreds of cassettes of unknown function. Here, we show that many of these cassettes encode anti-phage defence systems. We found numerous streamlined variants of known systems, which have presumably evolved to fit the small size constraints of integron cassettes recombination and genesis. Intrigued by the rarity of known systems in the sedentary chromosomal integron of the Vibrio cholerae 7th cholera pandemic strain, we tested the presence of anti-phage functions in all its cassettes of unknown function. We found that at least 16 of the strain cassettes have an anti-phage activity in V. cholerae or E. coli. This represents 18% of the tested cassettes and almost 10% of all the integron cassettes, providing at long last a key adaptive role for a significant fraction of the sedentary integrons. Most of the newly discovered systems have little or no similarity to previously known ones and our experiments show that several mediate defence through cell lysis or growth arrest. One of these systems encodes a 64 amino acids protein, which represents the smallest known protein providing autonomous phage resistance. Given the thousands of uncharacterized integron cassette families, integrons could represent an untapped treasure trove of streamlined anti-phage systems.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Dendritic depolarization created a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation.

NMDARs enable calcium influx into neurons and are critical for normal brain function. However, increasing evidence shows that calcium influx in neurological diseases is augmented by calcium-permeable AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Here, we demonstrate that these calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) are inhibited by memantine. Electrophysiology unveils that memantine inhibition of CP-AMPARs is dependent on their calcium permeability and the presence of their neuronal auxiliary subunit transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). Through cryo-electron microscopy we elucidate that memantine blocks CP-AMPAR ion channels in a unique mechanism of action from NMDARs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that memantine reverses a gain of function AMPAR mutation found in a patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder and inhibits CP-AMPARs in nerve injury. Our findings alter the paradigm for the memantine mechanism of action and provide a blueprint for therapeutic approaches targeting CP-AMPARs.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Aging-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis5,6, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, using physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models and primary cells7,8, we demonstrate aging suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by aging-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, leading to a functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1--lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescue stemness and promote tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-- lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells via induction of ferroptosis. We find that aging-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites associates with elevated NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells by inhibition of DNA methylation. We uncover that aging drives a functional iron insufficiency, which leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis, but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate in young individuals, revealing a critical window for such cancer prevention efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Although nucleolar associated domains (NADs) have been recently mapped, the mechanisms of NAD association with nucleoli and the functional significance of their localization remain unclear. Here, we show that NAD association with nucleoli is mediated by nucleophosmin (NPM1), a factor located within the granular component, the outer layer of the nucleolus. NPM1 binds NADs, interacts with the histone lysine methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2), and is required for establishing H3K9me2 at NADs. Loss of NPM1 or expression of NPM1 mutant lacking the DNA binding domain (NPM1{Delta}DBD) caused NAD dissociation from nucleoli and H3K9me2 reduction specifically at NADs. G9a is dispensable for NAD contacts with nucleoli and interacts with NPM1{Delta}DBD, indicating that NADs acquire G9a-mediated H3K9me2 only after associating with NPM1 at nucleoli. The results provide mechanistic insights into how genomic domains associate with nucleoli and acquire their repressive chromatin state. Additionally, our findings suggest that the nucleolus not only serves as a scaffold for positioning repressive chromatin domains but also plays a direct role in establishing these chromatin states.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

To the best of our knowledge, the quality of the generated code in this domain has not been studied. We present a quantitative benchmark to estimate the capability of LLMs to generate code for solving common BIA tasks. Our benchmark currently consists of 57 human-written prompts with corresponding reference solutions in Python, and unit-tests to evaluate functional correctness of potential solutions. We demonstrate our benchmark here and compare 18 state-of-the-art LLMs. To ensure that we will cover most of our community needs we also outline mid- and long-term strategies to maintain and extend the benchmark by the BIA open-source community. This work should support users in deciding for an LLM and also guide LLM developers in improving the capabilities of LLMs in the BIA domain.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we triggered epileptogenesis in mice by the intra-amygdala injection of kainic acid and profiled by RNA sequencing their hippocampal diurnal mRNA rhythmicity. We show that epileptogenesis largely reshapes the hippocampal transcriptomic rhythmicity and that the molecular clock machinery is inhibited due to the disruption of the core clock gene Bmal1. We identified relevant dysregulated pathways and their dynamics in epileptogenesis, predicting a key role for microglial-driven neuroinflammation. We predicted the genes that Bmal1 is directly controlling over time. Finally, we sought for translational relevance evidence by performing RNA sequencing in hippocampal samples resected from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HS) and cross-analyzing datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Specific cellular-synaptic sources of inhibition in SPW-R remain unclear, as there are >60 types of GABAergic interneurons in CA1. Axo-axonic cells (AAC) are defined by their synaptic targeting of the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells, potently controlling spike output. The impact of AAC activity on SPW-R is controversial, due mainly to ambiguity of AAC identification. Here we monitored and manipulated opto-tagged AACs in behaving mice using silicon probe recordings. We found a large variability of AAC neurons, varying from enhanced to suppressed spiking during SPW-Rs, in contrast to the near-uniform excitation of other parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. AACs received convergent monosynaptic inputs from local pyramidal cell assemblies, which strongly influenced their participation in SPW-Rs. Optogenetic silencing of AACs increased power and duration of SPW-Rs, recruiting a greater number of PYR, suggesting AACs control SPW-R dynamics. We hypothesize that lateral inhibition by reciprocal PYR-AAC interactions thus supports the organization of cell assemblies in SPW-R.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

A central question in bacterial ecology is why some species engage in cooperative interactions, whereas others compete. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By scanning thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions to the availability of environmental resources.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

As a mechanism of study, we use antisense RNAs (asRNAs). The asRNAs are expressed with the existing messenger RNA (mRNA) of a logic gate in a single transcript and target mRNAs of adjacent gates, creating a feedback of the protein-mediated repression that implements the core function of the logic gates. The extended transcripts then share a common sequestration reaction mediated by the cellular host's RNA metabolism. This sequestration consists of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation by asRNA and adjacent mRNA and subsequent degradation by the host. Numerical and stochastic analysis suggests that the feedback increases the steepness of the gate's transition region, reduces the leakage, and can potentially be used to adjust the transition location. To leverage these effects, we demonstrate how design parameters can be tuned to obtain desired dose-response curves and how arbitrary circuits can be assembled using the improved gates.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Here, we combined computational and laboratory experiments to explore the abundance, distribution, and activity of prophage elements in Bacillus subtilis. NCBI database genome sequences and isolates from 1 cm3 riverbank soil samples were analyzed to provide insights at global and local geographical scales, respectively. Most prophages in wild B. subtilis isolates were related to mobile genetic elements previously identified in laboratory strains. Some large groups of prophages were closely related to completely uncharacterized yet functional Bacillus phages, or completely unknown. As certain prophage groups were unique to local isolates, we explored factors influencing prophages within a single genome. Phylogenetic relatedness was a slightly better predictor of host prophage repertoire than geographical origin. We show that cryptic phages can play a major role in acquisition and/or maintenance of other prophage elements both via strong antagonism or by co-dependence. Laboratory experiments showed that most predicted prophages may be cryptic, since they failed to induce under DNA-damaging stress conditions. Interestingly, the magnitude of stress responses remained proportional to the total number of prophage elements predicted, suggesting their importance in host physiology. This study highlights the diversity, integration patterns, and co-occurrence of prophages in B. subtilis and their potential impact on host evolution and physiology. Understanding these dynamics provides insight into bacterial genome evolution and prophage-host interactions, laying the groundwork for future experimental studies on the roles of phages in the ecology and evolution of this bacterial species.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Kinetic models of metabolism play a critical role in integrating omics data, as they provide explicit connections between metabolite concentrations, metabolic fluxes, and enzyme levels. Nevertheless, the challenges associated with determining the kinetic parameters that underlie cellular physiology pose significant obstacles to the broader acceptance and adoption of these models within the research community. Here, we present RENAISSANCE, a generative machine learning framework for efficiently parameterizing large-scale kinetic models with dynamic properties matching experimental observations. Through seamless integration and consolidation of diverse omics data and other relevant information, like extracellular medium composition, physicochemical data, and expertise of domain specialists, we show that the proposed framework accurately characterizes unknown intracellular metabolic states, including metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations in E. colis metabolic network. Moreover, we show that RENAISSANCE successfully estimates missing kinetic parameters and reconciles them with sparse and noisy experimental data, resulting in a substantial reduction in parameter uncertainty and a notable improvement in the accuracy and reliability of the parameter estimates. The proposed framework will be invaluable for researchers who seek to analyze metabolic variations involving changes in metabolite and enzyme levels and enzyme activity in health and biotechnological studies.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

TE invasions triggered by HT may be much more abundant than previously thought. For example, previous studies in Drosophila melanogaster found 11 TE invasions over 200 the past years. A major limitation of current approaches for detecting recent invasions is the necessity for a repeat-library, which is notoriously difficult to generate. To address this, we developed GenomeDelta, a novel approach for identifying sample-specific sequences, such as recently invading TEs, without prior knowledge of the sequence. It can thus be used with model and non-model organisms. As input, GenomeDelta requires a long-read assembly and short-read data. It will find sequences in the assembly that are not represented in the short read data. Beyond identifying recent TE invasions, GenomeDelta can detect sequences with spatially heterogeneous distributions, recent insertions of viral elements and recent lateral gene transfers. We thoroughly validated GenomeDelta with simulated and real data from extant and historical specimens. Finally, we demonstrate that GenomeDelta can reveal novel biological insights: we discovered the three most recent TE invasions in Drosophila melanogaster and a novel TE with a geographically heterogeneous distribution in Zymoseptoria tritici.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.

MethodsSurveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.

ResultsThe Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.

ConclusionsUrgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak.","10.1038/s41591-024-03130-3","medrxiv",1720389909947

Archaeozoological analysis, isotope analysis, and radiocarbon dating of identifiable domestic equid remains from two contexts associated with the initial occupation of Jamestown demonstrate intense processing and consumption of the first Jamestown horses during the ""Starving Time"" winter of 1609, while paleopathological data show evidence of their use in transport. Osteological, genetic, and isotopic study of these equid remains reveal the presence of at least one adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a trans-Atlantic stopover. These results reveal the importance of equids in the survival of early European settlers and the global connectivity of early trans-Atlantic exchange in horses and donkeys, showing Caribbean and African links in the founding livestock populations and pointing towards an important and ecologically-anchored role for donkeys in the early colonial lifeways along the Eastern seaboard.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720389909947

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720389909947

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
