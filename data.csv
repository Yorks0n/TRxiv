Design: Matched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up. Setting: Florida's state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics. Participants: Matched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021. Intervention: Initial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 Main outcome measures: All-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose Results: There were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431,1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding. Conclusion: Florida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

However, disease mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Objectives: To evaluate the frequency and severity of autonomic dysfunction in a subset of carefully phenotyped, previously healthy patients with LC-POTS using a detailed protocol of autonomic, cerebrovascular, respiratory, blood, and tissue analyses. Methods: Participants in this study completed a battery of autonomic function tests, including measures of sudomotor, cardiovagal, and sympathetic adrenergic function, and head-up tilt (HUT) with transcranial Doppler measures of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv), end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2), cerebral and skeletal muscle near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and plasma catecholamines. Skin biopsy was performed at proximal and distal sites and analyzed for intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) and phosphorylated -synuclein (P-Syn). Results were compared to healthy controls (HC) [&ge;] 3 months post-COVID infection with no lasting sequelae. Results: LC-POTS participants (n=24) exhibited a greater increase in heart rate on HUT (31.1{+/-}20.3, p=0.01), and 38% exhibited elevated upright norepinephrine levels consistent with a hyperadrenergic response. CBFv did not significantly differ between LC-POTS and HC (n=10). EtCO2 and NIRS were also similar between groups. Twenty-two percent of LC-POTS and 38% of HC had decreased IENFD on skin biopsy, while 8.7% LC-POTS had dermal P-Syn aggregation on skin biopsy, compared to none of HC. Conclusions: LC-POTS was associated with widespread autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic tachycardia, sympathetic adrenergic hyperactivity, small fiber neuropathy, and dermal P-Syn deposition. Our findings support the concept of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms in most patients with POTS triggered by SARS-CoV-2.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

Since most of the neural matrix is composed of sugars, development of genetically encoded tags has been limited. Therefore, although several staining protocols exist for ECM in fixed tissue, there are no reliable matrix labels for live imaging. Here we report a viral-mediated fluorescent probe that binds to HA and labels the mouse brain ECM. The vector encodes the HA binding domain from neurocan fused to GFP and an externalization tag (AAV-Ncan-GFP), enabling transduced cells to secrete the fluorescent hyalectan into the extracellular space, thereby labeling HA. We demonstrate stable probe expression in organotypic brain slices, as well as in vivo in the mouse cortex, where it labels both perineuronal nets and interstitial matrix. We validate HA labeling through colocalization with HABP and sensitivity to hyaluronidase, and confirm the probes extracellular localization by shadow imaging. As a proof of concept, we combine AAV-Ncan-GFP with dendritic spine imaging ex vivo and calcium transient imaging in vivo, providing a real-time map of local ECM alongside neural function. The probe enables time-lapse imaging of ECM dynamics in live mice, facilitating longitudinal studies across a wide range of timescales, from minutes to days. The results establish AAV-Ncan-GFP as a valuable tool for real-time observation of brain ECM and a promising resource to explore ECM dynamics and brain function in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1746137319532

However, the underlying mechanisms driving functional {beta}-cell heterogeneity are still not fully understood. Here, we aimed to investigate how paracrine signaling, specifically GLP-1R mediated -{beta}-cell communication shapes functional {beta}-cell heterogeneity. To address this question, we sought to understand how {beta}-cell function and heterogeneity are altered when the -to {beta}-cell communication was inhibited via GLP1-R antagonist, exendin-9. To this end, we utilized confocal imaging to record calcium response in isolated islets from GCaMP6s mice and in islets from pancreatic slices from C57Bl6 mice, both before and after the application of exendin-9. We found that inhibiting -{beta}-cell communication prolonged the response-time, increased 1st phase heterogeneity, and decreased the peak of the 1st phase islets response. Additionally, it reduced 2nd phase oscillation frequency and 2nd phase heterogeneity, thereby enhancing 2nd phase coordination across {beta}-cells. These changes in oscillation frequency were also found to be more pronounced in -neighboring {beta}-cells. Additionally, we also found that inhibiting GLP1-R mediated -{beta}-cell communication disrupted the temporal consistency and -cell proximity of 1st responder and hub-cell functional {beta}-cell subpopulations in the islet.","NA","biorxiv",1746137319532

MethodsAt two time-points, we acquired T1-weighted MRI images (mean [SD] follow-up period 8.98 [2.20] years) of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD; N=32) and Bipolar Disorder (BD; N=6) and healthy controls (HC; N = 37) at two sites (Dublin, Munster). Using a brain age prediction model trained on a sample of over 10,000 subjects of the German National Cohort (GNC), we estimated individual BAG at two time-points (baseline and follow-up) using gray matter segments derived from MRI images. Employing linear-mixed-effects models, we tested main effects of diagnosis and hospitalizations during follow-up on BAG at baseline and follow-up, as well as their interaction with time respectively. In an exploratory analysis, we tested if BAG at baseline was predictive of hospitalizations during the nine-year follow-up using logistic regression and 10-fold nested cross-validation.

ResultsMDD patients showed a larger BAG compared to HC (MDD>HC: p=.039, MDD vs. BD: n.s.), while BD patients only showed a tendency for a larger BAG (p = .066). In the Munster subsample (N=52), patients with hospitalizations showed a higher BAG compared to patients without hospitalizations (p=.001). No significant group-by-time interaction could be detected. However, higher BAG at baseline was associated with the number of hospitalizations during follow-up (p=.018), however, the cross-validation of our prediction with an accuracy of 64.3 % was not significant (p=.071).

DiscussionOur results show that BAG did not change over time as a function of patients course of disease. The present study rather suggests that a higher estimation of biological aging (higher BAG) predicts future hospitalizations. Therefore, BAG may indicate a patients vulnerability to future recurrence.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

It is estimated to affect one in ten people and can be extremely debilitating. With few publicly funded long Covid clinics, most people rely on primary care providers as a first point of contact. There is currently limited understanding of the experience of accessing primary health care by adults living with long Covid in New Zealand.    Purpose  To explore the experiences of accessing primary health care by adults living with long Covid.   Methods  A narrative inquiry approach was used to capture participants lived experiences of accessing primary health care. Zoom interviews and discussions were conducted with study participants. The automatically generated transcripts were reviewed and corrected and the collated data were analysed using Braun and Clarkes thematic analysis.   Results  Eighteen people participated in the interviews. Codes were identified and, through an iterative process, themes were generated, reviewed, and named. The seven themes included lack of upskilling of primary care staff; let down by the Government; self-advocacy and its cost; and throwing money at it.   Conclusion(s)  The picture painted by participants was bleak with a sense that the world had moved on from Covid-19 and left them behind, with some experiencing a lack of support in primary health care. Better support might be achieved through a public awareness campaign for improved delivery of credible information, and greater utilisation of the allied health workforce.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

While numerous studies have established substantial genetic contribution for LOAD, the interpretation of heritability estimates remains challenging. These challenges are further complicated by the binary nature of LOAD status, where estimation and interpretation require additional considerations. Through a systematic review, we identified LOAD heritability estimates from 6 twin studies and 17 genome-wide association studies, all conducted in populations of European ancestry. We demonstrate that these heritability estimates for LOAD vary considerably. The variation reflects not only differences in study design and methodological approaches but also the underlying study population characteristics. Our findings indicate that commonly cited heritability estimates, often treated as universal values, should be interpreted within specific population contexts and methodological frameworks.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

While cholinergic activity supports cortical activation during REM sleep, direct evidence for a link between cholinergic degeneration and early REM sleep alterations in humans is still lacking. Here, we tested the long-standing hypothesis that early cholinergic denervation may be associated with REM sleep EEG slowing in older adults with and without Mild Cognitive Impairment. Twenty-four older participants (mean [standard deviation] age: 71.29 [4.85] years; 58.33% women; 25% participants with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment) without dementia or moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea underwent a night of in-laboratory polysomnography, comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation, structural MRI and molecular PET imaging with [18F]-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV), known for its sensitivity to quantify brain cholinergic innervation. Voxel-wise multiple regressions assessed the associations between REM sleep characteristics (i.e., REM sleep percentage, relative theta power and EEG slowing ratios, defined as [delta + theta]/[alpha + beta] power) and FEOBV-PET standard uptake value ratio maps corrected for partial volume effects, controlling for sex. Given that FEOBV uptake was higher in women compared to men, we also performed exploratory sex-stratified analyses adjusted for age. Higher REM sleep EEG slowing over frontal and parietal derivations was significantly associated with cortical cholinergic denervation, notably in fronto-parietal areas and the medial temporal lobe (P<0.005 level, combined with a cluster-level family-wise error correction). Exploratory sex-stratified analyses revealed that REM sleep EEG slowing was associated with cholinergic denervation in medial temporal regions in women, and neocortical regions in men. These findings provide the first direct in vivo evidence that REM sleep EEG slowing could represent a sensitive marker of cortical cholinergic denervation in older adults, prior to dementia onset. Thus, quantitative REM sleep EEG may constitute a promising marker for early diagnosis and disease-modifying interventions in Alzheimer's disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

Using genetically engineered model organisms, cell cultures, proteomic and metabolomic profiling, and human genetics, we show that ATG7 deficiency shifts PT cell metabolism and differentiation toward growth at the expense of function. ATG7 loss impairs autophagy-mediated lipid droplet homeostasis, causing their accumulation and disrupting fatty acid transfer to mitochondria, compromising energy metabolism and cellular function. In zebrafish, reintroducing human wild-type ATG7 restores homeostasis, whereas inhibiting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation induces phenotypic changes in wild-type cells. In humans, ATG7 variation associates with increased kidney disease risk, and loss-of-function variants cause tubular proteinuria and altered mitochondrial metabolism. Low ATG7 levels correlate with dedifferentiation, altered metabolic pathways, and poor renal cell carcinoma outcomes. Together, our results establish a metabolic paradigm that links autophagy to kidney epithelial cell fate specialization, with broad implications for health and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

There is broad consensus regarding the necessity to optimise the preservation of the tree of life by including evolutionary information in conservation prioritisation, a notion also endorsed by major policy frameworks. However, evolutionarily-informed prioritisations are lacking for most plants, resulting in a taxonomic imbalance in the evolutionary information incorporated in global biodiversity analyses, which has undermined conservation for decades. Here, we use comprehensive species-level phylogenetic trees, and extinction risk estimates, to generate the first global assessment of angiosperm evolutionary history at risk, and to identify phylogenetically-informed conservation priorities for the world's flowering plants. We estimate that more than one fifth of angiosperm evolutionary history is at risk of extinction in the short term. Using the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered approach, we identify 9,945 threatened plant species that disproportionately account for total evolutionary history at risk. Species and area prioritisations incorporating evolutionary history are urgently needed to correct imbalances between plants and animals, monitor the effectiveness of conservation efforts, and optimise conservation resource allocation in the face of increasing human pressures on Earth's biodiversity.","NA","biorxiv",1746137319532

Methods A rapid review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach. Searches were completed in June 2024 and included MEDLINE, Embase, American Psychological Association (APA) PsycINFO, evidence based medicine (EBM) Reviews (including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), Health Management Information Consortium, Web of Science and Google Scholar. This review included studies on LC symptoms lasting over 12 weeks, focusing on 1) non-workplace- and workplace-based support for RTW in LC patients, and/or 2) barriers and facilitators to RTW in LC patients. A quality assessment was conducted using the JBI Systematic Reviews critical appraisal tool. The data were summarised in tabular format and a narrative summary. This study was pre-registered (PROSPERO-ID: CRD42023478126). Results Twenty-five studies were included. While many studies demonstrated rigorous methodologies and low risk of bias levels, some had high and medium risk levels. Non-workplace-based support was mostly measured quantitatively and included interdisciplinary healthcare programmes, clinical interventions, and rehabilitation programmes focusing on pacing and breathing strategies. Compensation and insurance schemes were important funders of these interventions. Workplace-based support was mostly measured qualitatively. Barriers to the provision of support at organisational level included lack of understanding of LC symptoms, insufficient workplace guidance, and educational gaps among managers. Individual barriers included threat of income loss, remote working and disconnection from the workplace. Facilitators for support included recognition and validation of LC and its symptoms, and eligibility for disability benefits associated with work. Conclusions RTW is an important outcome of health related absence and should be systematically recorded in studies of people with long COVID (PwLC). The heterogeneity and unpredictability of LC symptoms create challenges for supporting working age populations. Further research is crucial to better understand the specific RTW needs for PwLC and address potential barriers and facilitators to effective support. Consistent guidelines on LC's definition, and disability status may facilitate the provision of support and the development of interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

However, current techniques remain limited by their reliance on simplified endothelial cell populations rather than a complete endothelial system. We engineered Multi-Region Brain Organoids (MRBOs) that integrate cerebral, mid/hindbrain, and complex endothelial organoids into one structure. Different from the earlier approaches based on isolated HUVECs, our endothelial organoids contain diverse vascular cell types, including vascular progenitors, mature endothelial cells, pericytes, proliferating angiogenic cells and stromal cells. Our strategy employs a sequential modulation of key developmental pathways to generate individual organoids, followed by optimized fusion conditions that maintain regional identities while supporting cellular integration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing shows that MRBOs develop discrete neural populations specific to each brain region alongside specialized endothelial populations that establish paracrine signalling networks. Integration analysis with human fetal brain data shows that MRBOs contribute to 80% of cellular clusters found in human fetal brain tissue (Carnegie stages 12-16), whereas CellChat analysis identifies 13 previously uncharacterized endothelial-neural signalling interactions. Notably, we uncover endothelial-derived factors that support the persistence of intermediate progenitor populations during hindbrain development, but not during the cerebral one thereby revealing a new role for complex endothelial populations in regional brain patterning. This platform enables matching multiple developmental regions, fully incorporating the endothelial nature at the same time providing opportunities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders in which neural-endothelial interactions are disrupted. Our engineered MRBO system establishes a foundation for investigating complex neurodevelopmental processes, providing an enabling context closer to physiological relevance.","NA","biorxiv",1746137319532

Saffron (Crocus sativus) supplementation has been linked to sleep improvements and gut microbiome changes, but its effect on sleep quality through gut microbiota-brain axis modulation remains unexplored. A randomised, placebo-controlled pilot study of saffron (30mg/day for 4-weeks) was conducted with 52 older adults (55-85 years) experiencing sleep complaints. Subjective and objective sleep quality were measured using validated questionnaires and electroencephalography-based sleep tracker respectively. A subgroup (n=26) underwent microbiome analysis. Saffron supplementation improved subjective sleep quality (p=0.02) and sleep efficiency (p=0.04). Objective measures showed reduced latency to persistent sleep (p=0.003) and sleep onset latency (p=0.03). Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis of the microbiome revealed increases in Faecalibacterium (q=0.013), Lachnoclostridium (q=0.045), Prevotella (q=0.022), UBA1819 (q=0.020) and Oscillibacter (q=0.045), while decreasing Dialister (q=0.028). Univariate analysis further indicated increases in Lachnospiraceae-UGC-001 (p=0.020) and Roseburia (p=0.03), with a decrease in Turicibacter (p=0.045) in the saffron group. Oscillibacter and UBA1819 correlated with subjective measures of sleep efficiency (r=0.63, p=0.0007) and sleep latency (r=-0.39, p=0.04. Changes in Dialister, Turicibacter and UBA1819 were correlated with several measures of objective sleep quality including wake duration, latency to persistent sleep and wake-after-sleep-onset. Four-weeks saffron supplementation improved both subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults with sleep complaints, while increasing gut bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids. These results pave the way for further randomised controlled trials exploring the links between sleep quality and gut health and may help devising new preventative strategies for age-related brain disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

However, little is known about its genetic underpinnings, and whether this overlaps with brain structure and neuropsychiatric conditions. Hence, we conducted genome-wide association study across six graph metrics of the macroscale functional networks at global, hemispheric and regional levels and their hemispheric asymmetry in 54,030 individuals. We identified seven experiment-wide significant loci and pri-oritised ten candidate genes. Both global graph metrics and hemispheric asymmetry are modestly heritable, but phenotypically and genetically form two clusters. Furthermore, cortical macro- and microstructure are causally related to global graph metrics and asymmetry, respectively, suggesting a dual structural constraint on functional network organisation. Finally, amongst twelve common neuropsychiatric conditions, only autism was genetically correlated with graph metrics of the functional network, supporting phenotypic case-control differences in functional connectivity. Overall, our results suggest different genetic axes shaping different aspects of brain functional topology and demonstrate shared biology with brain structure and autism.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

Its best-known strain is H5N1, with South- or South-East Asia a likely location for an initial outbreak. Such an outbreak would be initiated through a primary event of bird-to-human infection, followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. Early interventions would require the extraction, integration and interpretation of epidemiological information from the limited and noisy case data available at outbreak onset. We studied the implications of a potential zoonotic spillover of H5N1 influenza into humans. Our simulations used BharatSim, an agent-based model framework designed primarily for the population of India, but which can be tuned easily for others. We considered a synthetic population representing farm-workers (primary contacts) in a farm with infected birds. These primary contacts transfer infections to secondary (household) contacts, from where the infection spreads further. We simulate outbreak scenarios in such a setting, accounting for the network structure of human contacts and the stochasticity of the infection process. We further simulated multiple interventions, including bird-culling, quarantines, and vaccinations. We show how limited, noisy data for primary and secondary infections can be used to estimate epidemiological transmission parameters, such as the basic reproductive ratio R0, in realistic settings. We describe the impact of early interventions (bird-culling, quarantines, and vaccination), taken together or separately, in slowing or terminating the outbreak. An individual-based model allows for the most granular description of the bird-human spillover and subsequent human-to-human transmission for the case of H5N1. Such models can be contextualised to individual communities across varied geographies, given representative contact networks. We show how such models allow for the systematic real-time exploration of policy measures that could constrain disease-spread, as well as guide a better understanding of disease epidemiology.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1746137319532
