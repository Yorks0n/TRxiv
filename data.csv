Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores- Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

We included 1,864,637 children and adolescents under 21 from 19 childrens hospitals and health institutions in the US with at least six months of follow-up time between March 2020 and May 2023. We divided the patients into three strata: patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) during the acute phase (within 28 days) of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and patients without pre-existing CKD or AKI. We defined a set of adverse kidney outcomes for each stratum and examined the outcomes within the post-acute and chronic phases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In each stratum, compared with the non-infected group, patients with COVID-19 had a higher risk of adverse kidney outcomes. For patients without pre-existing CKD, there were increased risks of CKD stage 2+ (HR 1.20; 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and CKD stage 3+ (HR 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15-1.59) during the post-acute phase (28 days to 365 days) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, children and adolescents with pre-existing CKD and those who experienced AKI were at increased risk of progression to a composite outcome defined by at least 50% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2, End Stage Kidney Disease diagnosis, dialysis, or transplant.

Lay abstractThis study examined the impact of COVID-19 on kidney health in children and adolescents under 21 years old in the United States. Using data from the RECOVER program, we analyzed the health records of 1,864,637 young individuals from 19 hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and May 2023. The study focused on three groups: those with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), those who experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) during the initial COVID-19 infection, and those without any prior kidney issues. The results showed that children and adolescents who had COVID-19 were at a higher risk of developing serious kidney problems later on, even if they had no previous kidney conditions. This research highlights the long-term effects of COVID-19 on kidney health in young people and underscores the importance of monitoring kidney function in pediatric COVID-19 patients.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393050

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

Recent large-scale metagenome surveys record the variety of microbial life in the oceans, wastewater, human gut, and earth, with compilations encompassing thousands of public datasets. So far, large-scale microbiome studies either miss functional information or consistency in sample processing, and although they may cover thousands of locations, these are missing resolution, sparsely located, or lacking metadata. Here, we present Microflora Danica, an atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes, encompassing 10,686 shotgun metagenomes and 449 full-length 16S and 18S rRNA datasets linked to a detailed 5 level habitat classification scheme. We determine that while human-disturbed habitats have high alpha diversity, the same species reoccur, revealing hidden homogeneity and underlining the importance of natural systems for total species (gamma) diversity. In-depth studies of nitrifiers, a functional group closely linked to climate change, challenge existing perceptions regarding habitat preference and discover several novel nitrifiers as more abundant than canonical nitrifiers. Together, the Microflora Danica dataset provides an unprecedented resource and the foundation for answering fundamental questions underlying microbial ecology: what drives microbial diversity, distribution and function.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

DNA repair is especially understudied in nondividing cells like neurons, which must withstand decades of DNA damage without replicating. This lack of knowledge limits the efficiency and precision of genome editing in clinically relevant cells. To address this, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and iPSC-derived neurons to examine how postmitotic human neurons repair Cas9-induced DNA damage. We discovered that neurons can take weeks to fully resolve this damage, compared to just days in isogenic iPSCs. Furthermore, Cas9-treated neurons upregulated unexpected DNA repair genes, including factors canonically associated with replication. Manipulating this response with chemical or genetic perturbations allowed us to direct neuronal repair toward desired editing outcomes. By studying DNA repair in postmitotic human cells, we uncovered unforeseen challenges and opportunities for precise therapeutic editing.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

We determined the cryo-EM structure of one hit, SHPRH, with the nucleosome at 2.8 angstrom resolution. The structure confirms the predicted acidic patch interaction, reveals that the SHPRH ATPase engages a different nucleosomal DNA location than other SF2-type ATPases, and clarifies the roles of SHPRH's domains in nucleosome recognition.

Utilizing the scattering properties of ZnO nanoparticles, we developed a flow cytometry based sorting methodology and identified thirteen proteins with ZnO binding interfaces. Three designs promoted ZnO nucleation under conditions where traditional inorganic binding peptides and control proteins were ineffective. Incorporation of these interfaces into higher order assemblies further enhanced nucleation.

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Lineage-specific losses of stress responses were less prevalent but evolutionarily more favored than gains. In C. sativa, sub-genomes contributed equally to stress responses and homeologs with divergent stress responses typically do not exhibit high coding sequence or expression divergence.

Although a few natural products have been shown to protect bacteria from phage infection, the prevalence and diversity of chemical anti-phage defense remain largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a novel family of over 2000 lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters from Actinobacteria that participate in anti-phage defense, which we named lanthiphages. Lanthiphages colocalize with other anti-phage systems in defense islands. We demonstrate that native lanthiphage expression protects the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor against diverse phages. Heterologous expression of four additional lanthiphage pathways shows that the anti-phage function is conserved across this family of biosynthetic gene clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that lanthiphage expression leads to the production of a novel compound and alters phage transcription. Our findings highlight that biosynthetic gene clusters with anti-phage functions can be successfully identified through genomic analysis.

Here, we test this hypothesis by recording from individual neurons in the human hippocampus during a reading task. We found that cells that are selective to a particular noun are later reactivated by pronouns that refer to the cells preferred noun.

These processes occur over timescales which range from milliseconds to days. While various strategies exist to study integrin function across biological scales from cell to tissue, they are often chronic and fail to target specific cell-cell interactions acutely. We engineered cells to rapidly alter cell behavior by downregulating the surface population of 5{beta}1 integrins through hot-wired clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This method allows for inducible, specific internalization of 5{beta}1 integrins, achieving acute downregulation across various cell lines in 5-30 minutes. We show that induced internalization of 5{beta}1 decreases the cell area, causes uptake of extracellular fibronectin, and decreases the rate of tumor spheroid compaction. This targeted control of multiscale processes by rapid downregulation of this important class of cell surface receptors demonstrates that hot-wired endocytosis is a useful tool to acutely modulate cell biology.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Most of these proteins are synthesized with N-terminal presequences which serve as mitochondrial targeting signals. Presequences consistently form amphipathic helices, but they considerably differ in respect to their primary structure and length. Here we show that presequences can be classified into seven different groups based on their specific features. Using a test set of different presequences, we observed that group A presequences endow precursor proteins with improved in vitro import characteristics. We developed IQ-Compete (for Import and de-Quenching Competition assay), a novel assay based on fluorescence de-quenching, to monitor the import efficiencies of mitochondrial precursors in vivo. With this assay, we confirmed the increased import competence of group A presequences. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the presequence of the group A protein Oxa1 specifically recruits the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) containing protein TOMM34 to the cytosolic precursor protein. TOMM34 apparently serves as a presequence-specific targeting factor which increases the import efficiency of a specific subset of mitochondrial precursor proteins. Our results suggest that presequences contain a protein-specific priority code that encrypts the targeting mechanism of individual mitochondrial precursor proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated their unprecedented potential to decipher complex 'language' in biology. In this study, we introduced PlantRNA-FM, a novel high-performance and interpretable RNA FM specifically designed based on RNA features including both sequence and structure. PlantRNA-FM was pre-trained on an extensive dataset, integrating RNA sequences and RNA structure information from 1,124 distinct plant species. PlantRNA-FM exhibits superior performance in plant-specific downstream tasks, such as plant RNA annotation prediction and RNA translation efficiency (TE) prediction. Compared to the second-best FMs, PlantRNA-FM achieved an F1 score improvement of up to 52.45% in RNA genic region annotation prediction and up to 15.30% in translation efficiency prediction, respectively. Our PlantRNA-FM is empowered by our interpretable framework that facilitates the identification of biologically functional RNA sequence and structure motifs, including both RNA secondary and tertiary structure motifs across transcriptomes. Through experimental validations, we revealed novel translation-associated RNA motifs in plants. Our PlantRNA-FM also highlighted the importance of the position information of these functional RNA motifs in genic regions. Taken together, our PlantRNA-FM facilitates the exploration of functional RNA motifs across the complexity of transcriptomes, empowering plant scientists with novel capabilities for programming RNA codes in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment is designed to improve yield of low abundance sequences but has not been thoroughly explored with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) for use in clinical bacterial epidemiology. We designed CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs to enrich for the human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, by targeting multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, as well as common antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and the resistance-associated integron gene intI1. We validated enrichment performance in bacterial isolates before comparing enriched and unenriched sequencing of three human faecal samples spiked with K. pneumoniae at varying abundance. Enriched sequencing generated 56x and 11.3x the number of AMR and MLST reads respectively compared to unenriched sequencing and required approximately one third of the computational storage space. Targeting the intI1 gene often led to detection of 10-20 proximal resistance genes due to the long reads produced by ONT sequencing. We demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas9 enrichment combined with ONT sequencing enabled improved genomic characterisation outcomes over unenriched sequencing of patient samples. This method could be used to inform infection control strategies by identifying patients colonised with high-risk strains.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Here, we present cryo-electronmicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human K2P13.1 (THIK-1) and mutants in lipid nanodiscs and detergent. These reveal that, unlike other K2Ps13,18-24, K2P13.1 (THIK-1) has a two chamber aqueous inner cavity obstructed by the M4 transmembrane helix tyrosine (Tyr273, the flow restrictor). This hydrophilic barrier can be opened by an activatory mutation, S136P25, at natural break in the M2 transmembrane helix and by intrinsic channel dynamics. The structures also reveal a buried lipid in the P1/M4 intersubunit interface at a location, the PUFA site, that coincides with the TREK subfamily K2P modulator pocket for small molecule agonists18,26,27. This overlap, together with the effects of mutation on K2P13.1 (THIK-1) PUFA responses, indicates that the PUFA site lipids are K2P13.1 (THIK-1) cofactors.

However, the translational activity of single 80S ribosomes (monosomes) on mRNA is less well understood, even though these 80S monosomes represent the dominant ribosomal complexes in vivo. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine the translational activity of 80S monosomes across different tissues in Drosophila melanogaster. We discovered that while head and embryo 80S monosomes are highly translationally active, testis and ovary 80S monosomes are translationally inactive. RNA-Seq analysis of head monosome- and polysome-translated mRNAs, revealed that head 80S monosomes preferentially translate mRNAs with TOP motifs, short 5-UTRs, short ORFs and are enriched for uORFs. Overall, these findings highlight that regulation of translation initiation, and that protein synthesis is mostly performed by monosomes in head and embryo, whilst polysomes are the main source of protein production in testis and ovary.

Examples are reiki, aromatherapy, and reflexology. Salaried practitioners are employed to deliver these therapies, which are provided as palliative care, although they lack evidence of effectiveness. Such practices seem to conflict with efforts to make health care evidence based. The aim of this survey was to estimate the extent of certain pseudoscientific practices in cancer care departments in NHS hospitals in England, and to evaluate the rationale for such provision. Relevant documents were requested from NHS Trusts under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA). Main outcome measures were: number of trusts offering pseudoscientific practices in cancer departments, time to full FOIA response, presence and content of practice governance documents, and presence and quality of evidence for practices. 13.6% of eligible NHS trusts were offering pseudoscientific clinical practices. No trust provided a valid business case, or any robust evidence for the practices. The governance documents included claims about chakras, meridians, and invisible energy. Ten trusts required that informed consent be obtained from patients. This could not have been obtained because information given was misleading. Conclusions Pseudoscientific practices are embedded in the NHS in England, and governance documents show poor understanding of clinical evidence.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393050

Despite only being discovered in the 1980s, these viruses are speculated to have a much longer and more complex history within the human population than available modern data make clear. The viruses are carried by large fractions of the human population and can integrate into the human genome, leading to a wide range of clinical manifestations of varied severity. Here, we present the first nine full and two partial ancient genomes of HHV-6A and 6B, dating as far back as the Italian Iron Age (ca. 1100-600 BCE). We demonstrate that large fractions of the current HHV-6 diversity were already well established in the human population by the 14th century CE. Our data suggests that HHV-6B integrated into the human genome at the latest before the 1st-6th century CE, with two integrated clades being populated by ancient DNA genomes in our phylogeny, which further supports that they originated from likely much older ancient founder events. Additionally, we show that all known inherited chromosomally integrated (ici-)HHV-6A clades were already represented in European historical populations, confirming that ici-HHV-6A no longer integrates into the human germline within populations of European ancestry and likely endogenized in early human history. Finally, our results demonstrate the unique suitability of archaeological remains and ancient DNA for the study of the evolution of integrated viruses in human populations.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Until now, these viruses were only sporadically found in the digestive system of vertebrates. Here, we present the identification and genomic characterization of a proposed third order of viruses within the class Pokkesviricetes that currently consists of poxviruses and asfuviruses8. Members of this newly identified order we provisionally named Egovirales are commonly in the digestive system of vertebrates worldwide and are abundant in >10% of livestock animals, >2% of humans, and wild animals. Egoviruses have linear genomes up to 467 kbp in length and likely form multilayered icosahedral capsids, similar to those of asfuviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of conserved viral genes indicates that egoviruses are the sister group of poxviruses, with implications for capsid evolution. The diversity of egoviruses already far exceeds that of all known poxviruses and animal-associated asfuviruses. Phylogenetic analyses and patterns of virus distribution across vertebrates suggest that egoviruses can be either specialists or generalists associated with a single or multiple vertebrate species, respectively. Notably, one egovirus clade is human-specific, evolutionarily constrained, and spread across continents, demonstrating a long-term association between Egovirales and the human population on the global scale. Egoviruses not only expand the ecological and evolutionary scope of Pokkesviricetes, but also represent the only diverse, widespread, and abundant group of double-stranded DNA viruses infecting eukaryotic cells in the digestive system of vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

CISSc from Streptomyces coelicolor are distinct because they induce regulated cell death under stress, impacting the organisms life cycle. It remains unknown whether CISSc require accessory proteins to function.

Here we characterize the putative membrane adaptor CisA, a conserved factor in CISSc gene clusters across Streptomyces species. We show by cryo-electron tomography imaging and in vivo assays that CISSc contraction and function depend on CisA. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we provide an atomic model of the extended CISSc apparatus; however, CisA is not part of the complex. Instead, our findings show that CisA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus predicted to interact with CISSc components, thereby providing a possible mechanism for mediating CISSc recruitment to the membrane and subsequent firing.

Our work shows that CIS function in multicellular bacteria is distinct from Type 6 Secretion Systems and extracellular CIS, and possibly evolved due to the role of CISSc in regulated cell death.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

As such its measurement is crucial for understanding many aspects of animal behaviour, ecology and evolution, along with many more applications in fields ranging from optical physics, agriculture/plant sciences, human psychophysics, food science, architecture and materials sciences. The escalating threat of artificial light at night (ALAN) presents unique challenges for measuring the visual impact of light pollution, requiring measurement at low light levels across the human-visible and ultraviolet ranges, across all viewing angles, and often with high within-scene contrast.

Here I present a hyperspectral open-source imaging system (HOSI), an innovative and low-cost solution for collecting full-field hyperspectral data. The system uses a Hamamatsu C12880MA micro spectrometer to take single-point measurements, together with a motorised gimbal for spatial control. The hardware uses off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts, costing around {pound}350 in total. The system can run directly from a computer or smartphone with a graphical user interface, making it highly portable and user-friendly.

The HOSI system can take panoramic hyperspectral images that meet the difficult requirements of ALAN research, sensitive to low light around 0.001 cd.m-2, across 320-880nm range with spectral resolution of [~]9nm (FWHM) and spatial resolution of [~]0.2 degrees. The independent exposure of each pixel also allows for an extremely wide dynamic range that can encompass typical natural and artificially illuminated scenes, with sample night-time scans achieving peak-to-peak dynamic ranges of >50,000:1.

Here we present a 3.16 Angstrom resolution cryoEM structure of human THIK-1 that reveals several unique features, in particular, a tyrosine in M4 (Y273) which contributes to a lower 'Y-gate' that opens upon activation by several physiologically-relevant signalling pathways. We further demonstrate that binding of linoleic acid within a modulatory pocket adjacent to the filter also activates THIK-1, and that halothane inhibition involves a binding site within the inner cavity resulting in changes to the Y-gate. Finally, the extracellular cap domain contains positively-charged residues that line the ion exit pathway and which contribute to the unique biophysical properties of this channel.

Compartmentalized ordered membrane domains enriched with specific lipids, often termed lipid rafts, have been shown to modulate the physicochemical and mechanical properties of membranes and to drive protein sorting. Novel methods and tools enabling the visualization, characterization and/or manipulation of membrane compartmentalization are crucial to link the properties of the membrane with cell functions. Flipper, a commercially-available fluorescent membrane tension probe, has become a reference tool for quantitative membrane tension studies in living cells. Here, we report on a so far unidentified property of Flipper, namely, its ability to photosensitize singlet oxygen (1O2) under blue light when embedded into lipid membranes. This in turn results in the production of lipid hydroperoxides that increase membrane tension and trigger phase separation. In biological membranes, the photo-induced segregated domains retain the sorting ability of intact phase-separated membranes, directing raft and non-raft proteins into ordered and disordered regions, respectively, in contrast to radical-based photo-oxidation reactions that disrupt raft protein partitioning. The dual tension reporting and photosensitizing abilities of Flipper enable simultaneous visualization and manipulation of the mechanical properties and lateral organization of membranes, providing a powerful tool to optically control lipid raft formation and to explore the interplay between membrane biophysics and cell function.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

This is especially the case in challenging listening conditions, such as in real-life social environments. Autism has been associated with atypicalities in integrating audio-visual information, potentially underlying social difficulties in this population. The present study investigated multisensory integration (MSI) in speech processing among autistic (N=35) and neurotypical (N=35) adults. Participants performed a speech-in-noise task in a realistic multispeaker social scenario with audio-visual, auditory, or visual trials while their brain activity was recorded using EEG. The neurotypical group demonstrated a non-linear audio-visual interaction in alpha suppression, whereas the autistic group showed merely additive processing of these same inputs. Despite these differences in neural correlates, both groups achieved similar behavioural audio-visual facilitation outcomes. These findings suggest that although autistic and neurotypical brains might process multisensory cues differently, they achieve comparable benefits from audio-visual speech. These results contribute to the growing body of literature on MSI atypicalities in autism.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393050

This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood - and addressed - as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, our estimands. Second, we develop estimators for these effects - namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causal estimates from the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Surprisingly, milkshake consumption did not result in significant postingestive dopamine response in the striatum (p=0.62) nor any striatal subregion (p>0.33) and the highly variable interindividual responses were not significantly related to adiposity (BMI: r=0.076, p=0.51; %body fat: r=0.16, p=0.28).

Our study aims to assess the association between COVID-19 infections and subsequent kidney diseases, using influenza as a positive control and incorporating a negative control to establish clearer associations. Methods: A large retrospective cohort study with strata matching was conducted using the MarketScan database with records from Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. We used the international classification of 10th revision (ICD-10) codes to identify individuals and build three cohorts, (1) COVID-19 group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of COVID-19; (2) Influenza but no COVID-19 (positive control) group, with index dates as the diagnosis dates of Influenza; and (3) no COVID-19 / Influenza (negative control) group, with randomly assigned index dates between Jan. 2020 to Dec. 2021. The main outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To evaluate the association between COVID-19 and the new onset of kidney diseases relative to both control groups, we employed multivariable stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: The study included 939,241 individuals with COVID-19, 1,878,482 individuals in the negative control group, and 199,071 individuals with influenza. After adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, and medication histories, COVID-19 was significantly associated with increased risks of AKI (adjusted hazards ratio, aHR: 2.74, 2.61-2.87), CKD (aHR: 1.38, 1.32-1.45), and ESRD (aHR, 3.22; 95% CI, 2.67-3.88), while influenza was associated with a modestly increased risk of AKI (aHR: 1.24, 1.11-1.38) and had no impact on CKD (aHR: 1.03, 0.92-1.14), and ESRD (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.55-1.29). Time-specific analyses indicated that while the HR for AKI declined from 0-180 days to 0-540 days, the HR for CKD and ESRD remained stable, with COVID-19's risk surpassing influenza's risk throughout follow-up. Exploratory analysis also found significant impacts of COVID-19 on glomerular diseases (aHR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.50). Conclusion: In this large real-world study, COVID-19 infections were associated with a 2.3-fold risk of developing AKI, a 1.4-fold risk of CKD, and a 4.7-fold risk of ESRD compared to influenza. Greater attention needs to be paid to kidney diseases in individuals after contracting COVID-19 to prevent future adverse health outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393050

Unexpectedly, the successful recovery of rVSVs bearing the spike from SHC014, a SARS-like bat CoV, was associated with the acquisition of a novel substitution in the S2 fusion peptide-proximal region (FPPR). This substitution enhanced viral entry in both VSV and coronavirus contexts by increasing the availability of the spike receptor-binding domain to recognize its cellular receptor, ACE2. A second substitution in the spike N-terminal domain, uncovered through forward-genetic selection, interacted epistatically with the FPPR substitution to synergistically enhance spike:ACE2 interaction and viral entry.

Actinoporins are a family of -pore-forming proteins that bind specifically to sphingomyelin-containing lipid membranes, where they oligomerize and form transmembrane pores. The numerous contacts they form with the lipid membrane make them an exemplary object for studying the different roles that lipids play in the structure and function of membrane proteins. Through a comprehensive cryo-electron microscopic analysis of a pore formed by an actinoporin Fav from the coral Orbicella faveolata, we show that the octameric pore interacts with 112 lipids in the upper leaflet of the membrane. The structures of Fav pores formed on different lipid membranes reveal the different roles of lipids and demonstrate that the actinoporin surface is perfectly suited for binding multiple receptor sphingomyelin molecules. When cholesterol is present in the membrane, it forms nanodomains associated with the pore, leading to a tighter arrangement of lipids, which in turn increases the stability of the pores. Atomistic simulations support the structural data, show that the protein-bound lipids are not mobile, and reveal additional effects of the pore on the lipid membrane. Overall, these data reveal a complex network of protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions, and an underrated role of lipids in the structure and function of transmembrane protein complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Despite the approval of an ASO and the optimism it brings to the field, the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of therapeutic SOD1 modulation can be improved. Here, we developed a chemically stabilized divalent siRNA scaffold (di-siRNA) that effectively suppresses SOD1 expression in vitro and in vivo. With optimized chemical modification, it achieves remarkable CNS tissue permeation and SOD1 silencing in vivo. Administered intraventricularly, di-siRNASOD1 extended survival in SOD1-G93A ALS mice, surpassing survival previously seen in these mice by ASO modalities, slowed disease progression, and prevented ALS neuropathology. These properties offer an improved therapeutic strategy for SOD1-mediated ALS and may extend to other dominantly inherited neurological disorders.

Human genetic studies established a causal role for protein assembly in neurodegeneration2. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown, which is limiting progress in developing clinical tools for these diseases. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the structures of the protein filaments to be determined from patient brains1. All diseases studied to date have been characterised by the self-assembly of a single intracellular protein in homomeric amyloid filaments, including that of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) Types A and B3,4. Here, we used cryo-EM to determine filament structures from the brains of individuals with FTLD-TDP Type C, one of the most common forms of sporadic FTLD-TDP. Unexpectedly, the structures revealed that a second protein, annexin A11 (ANXA11), co-assembles with TDP-43 in heteromeric amyloid filaments. The ordered filament fold is formed by TDP-43 residues G282/284-N345 and ANXA11 residues L39-L74 from their respective low-complexity domains (LCDs). Regions of TDP-43 and ANXA11 previously implicated in protein-protein interactions form an extensive hydrophobic interface at the centre of the filament fold. Immunoblots of the filaments revealed that the majority of ANXA11 exists as a [~]22 kDa N-terminal fragment (NTF) lacking the annexin core domain. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections confirmed the co-localisation of ANXA11 and TDP-43 in inclusions, redefining the histopathology of FTLD-TDP Type C. This work establishes a central role for ANXA11 in FTLD-TDP Type C. The unprecedented formation of heteromeric amyloid filaments in human brain revises our understanding of amyloid assembly and may be of significance for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Insufficient abundance of energy carriers -as caused by the additional burden of artificial genetic circuits- shifts a cell's priority to survival, also harming the functionality of the genetic circuit. Moreover, recent works have shown the importance of energy expenditure in information transmission. Despite living organisms being non-equilibrium systems, non-equilibrium models capable of accounting for energy dissipation and non-equilibrium response curves are not yet employed in genetic design automation (GDA) software. To this end, we introduce Energy Aware Technology Mapping, the automated design of genetic logic circuits with respect to energy efficiency and functionality. The basis for this is an energy aware non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model of gene expression, capturing characteristics like energy dissipation -which we link to the entropy production rate- and transcriptional bursting, relevant to eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes. Our evaluation shows that a genetic logic circuit's functional performance and energy efficiency are disjoint optimization goals. For our benchmark, energy efficiency improves by 37.2% on average when comparing to functionally optimized variants. We discover a linear increase in energy expenditure and overall protein expression with the circuit size, where Energy Aware Technology Mapping allows for designing genetic logic circuits with the energy efficiency of circuits that are one to two gates smaller. Structural variants improve this further, while results show the Pareto dominance among structures of a single Boolean function.

Here, we investigate how subjective, physiological, and behavioural indicators of arousal and attentional state vary as a function of cardiac activity and brain-heart coupling. Combined electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and pupillometric records were obtained from 25 healthy human adults during the performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART). Thought-probes were intermittently administered during the SART to collect subjective reports of attentional state (i.e., on-task, mind-wandering, mind-blanking) and vigilance level (i.e., alertness). Mind-wandering and mind-blanking reports increased in frequency with time-on-task, but were associated with distinct behavioural profiles. Mind-blanking was further characterised by more profound decreases in heart-rate and pupil size than mind-wandering, and late modulation of the heartbeat-evoked potential. Besides attentional state, lower heart-rate predicted decreased vigilance and pupil size, while heart-rate variability predicted more impulsive behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings reveal that cardiac parameters afford complementary information about arousal states and attentional dynamics, illustrating the complexity of task disengagement from a cognitive and physiological perspective.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

We develop an inference framework to test existing population genetics models based on the joint distribution of allelic effect sizes and frequencies of trait-associated variants. A majority of traits have GWAS results that are inconsistent with neutral evolution or long-term directional selection (selection against a trait or against disease risk). Instead, we find that most traits show consistency with stabilizing selection, which acts to preserve an intermediate trait value or disease risk. Our observations also suggest that selection may reflect pleiotropy, with each variant influenced by associations with multiple selected traits.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Understanding how the pattern of differences in polygenic score predictions across individuals intersects with variation in ancestry can provide insights into the evolutionary forces acting on the trait in question, and is important for understanding health disparities. However, because most polygenic scores are computed using effect estimates from population samples, they are susceptible to confounding by both genetic and environmental effects that are correlated with ancestry. The extent to which this confounding drives patterns in the distribution of polygenic scores depends on patterns of population structure in both the original estimation panel and in the prediction/test panel. Here, we use theory from population and statistical genetics, together with simulations, to study the procedure of testing for an association between polygenic scores and axes of ancestry variation in the presence of confounding. We use a general model of genetic relatedness to describe how confounding in the estimation panel biases the distribution of polygenic scores in a way that depends on the degree of overlap in population structure between panels. We then show how this confounding can bias tests for associations between polygenic scores and important axes of ancestry variation in the test panel. Specifically, for any given test, there exists a single axis of population structure in the GWAS panel that needs to be controlled for in order to protect the test. Based on this result, we propose a new approach for directly estimating this axis of population structure in the GWAS panel. We then use simulations to compare the performance of this approach to the standard approach in which the principal components of the GWAS panel genotypes are used to control for stratification.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

The aging ovary assumes a fibro-inflammatory milieu which negatively impacts gamete quantity and quality as well as ovulation. Here we tested whether the systemic delivery of anti-inflammatory (Etanercept) or anti-fibrotic (Pirfenidone) drugs attenuates ovarian aging in mice. We first evaluated the ability of these drugs to decrease the expression of fibro-inflammatory genes in primary ovarian stromal cells. Whereas Etanercept did not block Tnf expression in ovarian stromal cells, Pirfenidone significantly reduced Col1a1 expression. We then tested Pirfenidone in vivo where the drug was delivered systemically via mini-osmotic pumps for 6-weeks. Pirfenidone mitigated the age-dependent increase in ovarian fibrosis without impacting overall health parameters. Ovarian function was improved in Pirfenidone-treated mice as evidenced by increased follicle and corpora lutea number, AMH levels, and improved estrous cyclicity. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Pirfenidone treatment resulted in an upregulation of reproductive function-related genes at 8.5 months and a downregulation of inflammatory genes at 12 months of age. These findings demonstrate that reducing the fibroinflammatory ovarian microenvironment improves ovarian function, thereby supporting modulating the ovarian environment as a therapeutic avenue to extend reproductive longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

P-TEFb, comprising cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)9 and cyclin T1, is a key transcription elongation kinase, which also regulates co-transcriptional splicing and mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. Chemical inhibition of SF3B1, a component of the splicing factor U2 snRNP, decreases P-TEFb recruitment to chromatin and mirrors the effect of P-TEFb inhibition on transcription. However, the mechanism of this effect of SF3B1 inhibitors was unclear. Here we show that SF3B1 inhibition causes rapid nuclear export of P-TEFb and loss of SF3B1 phosphorylation. SF3B1 is in complex with P-TEFb on chromatin with the elongation/splicing factor HTATSF1 and the splicing factor SNW1. SF3B1 inhibition causes the nuclear export of SNW1, but not of HTATSF1. The chromatin association of AFF4, an interaction partner of P-TEFb, is also affected by SF3B1 inhibition. Surprisingly, SF3B1 inhibition promotes degradation of SRSF2, a splicing factor known to help recruit P-TEFb to chromatin. Our results indicate that SF3B1 inhibition affects P-TEFb recruitment to genes via multiple pathways. Together, these interactions ensure efficient coupling of transcription and splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Intracellular growth requires the function of the Icm/Dot type-IVb secretion system, which translocates more than 300 proteins into host cells. A screen was performed to identify L. pneumophila proteins that stimulate MAPK activation, using Icm/Dot translocated proteins ectopically expressed in mammalian cells. In parallel, a second screen was performed to identify L. pneumophila proteins expressed in yeast that cause growth inhibition in MAPK pathway-stimulatory high osmolarity medium. LegA7 was shared in both screens, a protein predicted to be a member of the bacterial cysteine protease family that has five carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeats. Three conserved residues in the predicted catalytic triad of LegA7 were mutated. These mutations abolished the ability of LegA7 to inhibit yeast growth. To identify other residues important for LegA7 function, a generalizable selection strategy in yeast was devised to isolate mutants that have lost function and no longer cause growth inhibition on high osmolarity medium. Mutations were isolated in the two carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeats, as well as an inter-domain region located between the cysteine protease domain and the ankyrin repeats. These mutations were predicted by AlphaFold modeling to localize to the face opposite from the catalytic site, arguing that they interfere with the positive regulation of the catalytic activity. Based on our data, we present a model in which LegA7 harbors a cysteine protease domain with an inter-domain and two carboxyl-terminal ankyrin repeat regions that modulate the function of the catalytic domain.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

The lack of paired sequencing experiments severely restricts the analysis of microRNA-gene regulatory networks. We therefore explored whether protein-coding gene expression can be quantified from transcript fragments present in sRNAseq experiments. We first considered studies containing matched total RNA and small RNA from four human tissues and recovered transcript fragments from the small RNA experiments. We found that the expression levels of protein-coding gene transcripts from sRNAseq datasets was comparable to those from total RNAseq experiments (R2 ranging 0.33-0.76). We then analysed the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes from the same sRNAseq experiments and demonstrated that known microRNA-target interactions are, as expected, inversely correlated with the expression profiles of these microRNA-mRNA pairs. To confirm the utility of this approach, we applied our method to investigate microRNAs and their targets in breast cancer patient samples for which only sRNAseq was performed and only microRNAs studied. We again identified a clear inverse correlation between the expression of microRNAs and mRNAs that they are predicted to regulate (i.e. presence of a target site). We also found that upregulation of mir-429 is associated with the downregulation of QKI, an RNA-binding protein, in breast cancer samples. In conclusion, although the analysis of mRNA fragments to study gene expression from sRNAseq experiments may have its limitations, it can be very informative in the study of microRNA-mRNA interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Here we address three long-standing questions concerning senescence. First, we show that the ATM kinase is solely responsible for the induction of replicative senescence. Senescence was delayed by ATM inhibition (ATMi) or overexpression of TRF2, the shelterin subunit dedicated to ATM repression. In contrast, there was no evidence for ATR signaling contributing to replicative senescence even when ATMi was combined with ATR inhibition. Second, we show ATMi can induce apparently normal cell divisions in a subset of senescent cells, indicating that senescence can be reversed. Third, we show that the extended replicative life span at low (physiological) oxygen is due to diminished ATM activity. At low oxygen, cells show a decreased ATM response to dysfunctional telomeres and genome-wide DSBs compared to 20% oxygen. As this effect could be reversed by NAC, the attenuated response of ATM to critically short telomeres and the resulting extended life span at low oxygen is likely due to ROS-induced formation of cysteine disulfide-bridges that crosslink ATM dimers into a form that is not activated by DSBs. These findings show how primary human cells detect shortened telomeres and reveal the molecular mechanism underlying the telomere tumor suppressor pathway.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Changes in the rate of blood flow manifest in altered shear stress, which activates signaling cascades that drive vascular remodeling. Consistently, dysregulation of the endothelial response to fluid shear forces and aberrant flow patterns both lead to pathological conditions, including impaired blood vessel development and atherosclerosis. Despite its importance, the mechanisms driving the coordinated cell behavior underlying vascular remodeling are not fully understood. Combining classical cell biological approaches with advanced image analysis, mathematical modeling, biomimetic strategies, and in vivo studies, we identify the planar cell polarity (PCP) protein Vangl1 as an enforcer of flow-dependent cell dynamics in the vascular system. We demonstrate that shear stress triggers the relocation of Vangl1 from an internal reservoir to the plasma membrane at the initiation of cell remodeling. Membrane enrichment of Vangl1 is mediated by a Coronin1C-dependent shift in the equilibrium between endo- and exocytosis and results in the spatial reorganization of another essential PCP protein, Frizzled6 (Fzd6). The resulting mutual exclusion of the core PCP proteins Fzd6 and Vangl1 augments differential junctional and cytoskeletal dynamics along the flow axis. Loss of Vangl1 limits the ability of endothelial cells to respond to shear forces in a coordinated fashion, resulting in irregular cell alignment along the flow direction and erroneous vessel sprouting. Together, these studies introduce core PCP signaling as a determinant of collective cell dynamics and organization of the vascular system.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Here, we developed make-or-break Prime Editing (mbPE) that allows for precise and effective genetic engineering in the opportunistic human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast to traditional prime editing in which a nicking Cas9 is employed, mbPE harnesses wild type Cas9 in combination with a pegRNA that destroys the seed region or protospacer adjacent motif. Since most bacteria poorly perform template-independent end joining, correctly genome-edited clones are selectively enriched during mbPE. We show that mbPE can be used to introduce point mutations, deletions and targeted insertions, including protein tags such as a split luciferase, at selection efficiencies of over 93%. mbPE enables sequential genome editing, is scalable, and can be used to generate pools of mutants in a high-throughput manner.

However, limited microscopic understanding of it exists, particularly for anatomical asymmetry where there are few well-established animal models. In humans, most of the brain shows subtle, population-average, regional asymmetries in cortical thickness or surface area. In addition, a macro-scale twisting called the cerebral petalia exists in which the right hemisphere protrudes anteriorly relative to the left. Here, we ask whether neuroanatomical asymmetries can be observed in mice, leveraging 6 different neuroimaging cohorts of animals from 5 different research groups ([~]3,500 animals in total). We found an anterior-posterior pattern of volume asymmetry in mice, where anterior regions are larger on the right while posterior regions are larger on the left. This pattern appears driven by a similar trend in surface area asymmetry and is supported by a concordant pattern of positional asymmetries. The cerebral hemisphere as a whole appears shifted anteriorly on the right while the brainstem and cerebellum appear shifted anteriorly on the left. These results together indicate a small torsion of the brain is present in mice, similar to the cerebral petalia in humans. By establishing a signature of anatomical brain asymmetry in mice, we aim to provide a foundation for future studies to probe the mechanistic underpinnings of anatomical brain asymmetry seen in humans - a feature of the brain with extremely limited understanding.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Understanding indirect assortment is crucial for correctly adjusting for assortative mating, and for understanding intergenerational transmission. We attribute previous inconsistencies to idiosyncratic models and inconsistent use of relevant terms. In this paper, we develop a new framework for understanding indirect assortative mating and provide updated definitions of key terms. We then develop a model (the iAM-ACE-model) that can use partners of twins and siblings to distinguish the degree of assortment on genetic, social, and individual characteristics. We also expand this model to include children of twins and siblings (the iAM-COTS model), allowing us to explain parent-offspring similarity while accounting for indirect assortative mating and gene-environment correlations. We apply the models on educational attainment using 1,529,144 individuals in 209,792 extended families from Norwegian registry data and the Norwegian Twin Registry. The analysis suggests that partners correlate .67 (95% CIs: .66, .70) on a latent sorting factor associated with educational attainment, which we estimate to be about 30% (26%, 35%) heritable, 42% (37%, 47%) sibling-shared environment, 8% (4%, 13%) twin-shared environment, 17% (16%, 19%) gene-environment correlations, and 3% (2%, 5%) non-shared environment.

Thus, extensive genome mining of microbiomes is underway to identify biosynthetic gene clusters or BGCs that can be profiled as particular natural products, and computational methods have been developed to address this problem using machine learning. However, existing tools are ineffective due to a small training dataset, dependence on old genome mining tools, lack of relevant genomic descriptors, and prevalent class imbalance. This work presents a new tool, NPBdetect, that can detect multiple bioactivities and has been designed through rigorous experiments. Firstly, we composed a larger training set using MIBiG database and a test set through literature mining to build and assess the model respectively. Secondly, the latest antiSMASH genome mining tool was used to obtain BGC and introduced new sequence-based descriptors. Thirdly, neural networks are used to build the model by dealing with class imbalance issues through the class weighting technique. Finally, we compared the NPBdetect tool with an existing tool to show its efficacy and real-world utility in detecting several bioactivities with high confidence.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Despite their collective contribution towards global respiratory morbidity and mortality and potential to inform the future trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 endemicity, they are infrequently sequenced. We therefore developed a 1200bp amplicon-based whole genome sequencing scheme targeting all four seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. The Vivaldi method was applied retrospectively and prospectively using Oxford Nanopore Technology to approximately 400 seasonal coronavirus infections diagnosed in Nottingham, UK, from February 2016 to July 2023. We demonstrate that the amplicon multiplex strategy can be applied agnostically to determine complete genomes of five different species from two coronaviral genera. 304 unique seasonal coronavirus genomes of greater than 95% coverage were achieved: 64 for 229E, 85 for NL63, 128 for OC43 and 27 for HKU1. They collectively indicated a dynamic seasonal coronavirus genomic landscape, with co-circulation of multiple variants emerging and declining over the UK winter respiratory infection season, with further geographical distinction when compared to a global dataset. Prolonged infection with concomitant intra-host evolution was also observed for both Alpha- (NL63) and Betacoronaviruses (OC43). This data represents the largest single cohort of seasonal coronavirus genomes to date and also a novel amplicon scheme for their future global surveillance suitable for widespread and easy adoption in the post-SARS-CoV-2 era of viral genomics.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393050

Although non-human models have led to fundamental discoveries about the organization of the nervous system midline by the floor plate, an experimental model of human floor plate would enable broader insights into regulation of human neurodevelopment and midline connectivity. Here, we have developed stem cell-derived organoids resembling human floor plate (hFpO) and assembled them with spinal cord organoids (hSpO) to generate midline assembloids (hMA). We demonstrate that hFpO promote Sonic hedgehog-dependent ventral patterning of human spinal progenitors and Netrin-dependent guidance of human commissural axons, paralleling non-human models. To investigate evolutionary-divergent midline regulators, we profiled the hFpO secretome and identified 27 evolutionarily divergent genes between human and mouse. Utilizing the hMA platform, we targeted these candidates in an arrayed CRISPR knockout screen and reveal that GALNT2, a gene involved in O-linked glycosylation, impairs floor plate-mediated guidance of commissural axons in humans. This novel platform extends prior axon guidance discoveries into human-specific neurobiology with implications for mechanisms of nervous system evolution and neurodevelopmental disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Epigenomic features, such as post-translational modification of histones and chromatin accessibility, are key determinants of transcription factor binding and thereby play an important role in determining transcriptional responses to the tissue environment. It is unknown to what extent the epigenetic landscape of peripheral monocytes is rewired by cancer and how this could shape their transcriptional response upon recruitment to the tumor microenvironment. Here we used a combination of genome-wide assays for mRNA expression, chromatin accessibility and multiple histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) in a mouse model to investigate changes in the epigenomic landscape of peripheral monocytes. We then linked these epigenetic alterations to gene expression changes in monocytes occurring in the periphery or during tumor infiltration. We found that the distal tumor caused extensive remodeling of both H3K4me3+ promoters and H3K4me1+ enhancers in peripheral monocytes. Specifically, this involved the repression of interferon-responsive promoters and enhancers as well as the establishment of enhancers harboring binding motifs for transcription factors downstream of inflammatory and cytokine signaling pathways. The enhancers altered in the periphery could be linked to sustained gene expression changes which were less likely to be reversed in the tumor microenvironment. In addition, genes activated upon tumor infiltration showed prior epigenetic priming in peripheral monocytes. Overall, these results indicate that the epigenomic landscape of peripheral monocytes is altered in response to a distal tumor, and this could shape the transcriptional response of monocytes when they encounter microenvironmental signals upon infiltrating the tumor.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Recent advancements in proteomic techniques revealed the presence of acetylation in thousands of non-histone proteins. Here, we conducted extensive meta-analysis of 48 acetylomes spanning diverse organisms, including archaea, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worms, plants, insects, crustacea, fish, and mammals. Our analyzes revealed a predominance of a single acetylation site in a protein detected in all studied organisms, and proteins heavily acetylated, with >5-10 acetylated-sites, were represented by Hsp70, histone or transcription GTP-biding domain. Moreover, using gene enrichment approaches we found that ATP metabolic processes, glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pathways and oxidative stress response are among the most acetylated cellular processes. Finally, to better explore the regulatory function of acetylation in glycolysis and oxidative stress we used aldolase and superoxide dismutase A (SODA) enzymes as model. For aldolase, we found that K147 acetylation, responsible to regulate human enzyme, conserved in all phylogenic clade, suggesting that this acetylation might play the same role in other species; while for SODA, we identified many lysine residues in different species present in the tunnel region, which was demonstrated for human and Trypanosoma cruzi, as negative regulator, also suggesting a conserved regulatory mechanism. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the conservation and functional significance of lysine acetylation in different organisms emphasizing its roles in cellular processes, metabolic pathways, and molecular regulation, shedding light in the extensive function of non-histone lysine acetylation.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

While Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast is used extensively in research and biotechnology, it is a unicellular organism capable of only limited multicellular states. Here we expand the possibilities for engineering multicellular behaviours in yeast by developing modular toolkits for two key mechanisms seen in multicellularity, contact-dependent signalling and specific cell-to-cell adhesion. MARS (Mating-peptide Anchored Response System) is a toolkit based on surface-displayed fungal mating peptides and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling which can mimic juxtacrine signalling between yeasts. SATURN (Saccharomyces Adhesion Toolkit for multicellUlar patteRNing) surface displays adhesion-proteins pairs on yeasts and facilitates the creation of cell aggregation patterns. Together they can be used to create multicellular logic circuits, equivalent to developmental programs that lead to cell differentiation based on the local population. Using MARS and SATURN, we further developed JUPITER (JUxtacrine sensor for Protein-protein InTERaction), a genetic sensor for assaying protein-protein interactions in culture, demonstrating this as a tool to select for high affinity binders among a population of mutated nanobodies. Collectively, MARS, SATURN, and JUPITER present valuable tools that facilitate the engineering of complex multicellularity with yeast and expand the scope of its biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

SWI/SNF subunits are among the most frequently mutated genes in cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders. These mutations are often heterozygous loss-of-function alleles, indicating a dosage-sensitive role for SWI/SNF subunits in chromatin regulation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate SWI/SNF subunit dosage to ensure proper complex assembly remain largely unexplored. We performed a genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, using epigenome editing in mouse embryonic stem cells, and identified Mlf2 and Rbm15 as regulators of SWI/SNF complex activity. First, we show that MLF2, a poorly characterized chaperone protein, regulates a subset of SWI/SNF target genes by promoting chromatin remodeling activity. Next, we find that RBM15, part of the m6A RNA methylation writer complex, controls m6A modifications on specific SWI/SNF mRNAs to regulate protein levels of these subunits. Misregulation of m6A methylation causes overexpression of core SWI/SNF subunits leading to the assembly of incomplete complexes lacking the catalytic ATPase/ARP subunits. These data indicate that targeting modulators of SWI/SNF complex assembly may offer a potent therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with impaired chromatin remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we investigated how interactions between GABAARs and nAChRs influence dopaminergic axon excitability. Direct axonal recordings showed that benzodiazepine application suppresses subthreshold axonal input from cholinergic interneurons (CINs). In imaging experiments, we used the first temporal derivative of presynaptic calcium signals to distinguish between direct- and nAChR-evoked activity in dopaminergic axons. We found that GABAAR antagonism with gabazine selectively enhanced nAChR-evoked axonal signals. Acetylcholine release was unchanged in gabazine suggesting that GABAARs located on dopaminergic axons, but not CINs, mediated this enhancement. Unexpectedly, we found that a widely used GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin, inhibits axonal nAChRs and should be used cautiously for striatal circuit analysis. Overall, we demonstrate that GABAARs on dopaminergic axons regulate integration of nicotinic input to shape presynaptic excitability.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393050

Pathological anxiety is prevalent in up to 59% of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis complex (TSC)2, a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes for Tuberin (Tsc2) and/or Hamartin (Tsc1) that together comprise the eponymous protein complex. Here, we generated cell type-specific heterozygous knockout of Tsc2 in cells expressing oxytocin receptor (OTRCs) to model pathological anxiety-like behaviors observed in TSC patient population. The stress of prolonged social isolation induces a sustained negative affective state that precipitates behavioral avoidance, often by aberrant oxytocin signaling in the limbic forebrain3,4. In response to social isolation, there were striking sex differences in stress susceptibility in conditional heterozygote mice when encountering situations of approach-avoidance conflict. Socially isolated male mutants exhibited behavioral avoidance in anxiogenic environments and sought more social interaction for buffering of stress. In contrast, female mutants developed resilience during social isolation and approached anxiogenic environments, while devaluing social interaction. Systemic and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-specific inhibition of downstream effector of TSC, the integrated stress response (ISR), rescued behavioral approach toward anxiogenic environments and conspecifics in male and female mutant mice respectively. Further, we found that Tsc2 deletion in OTRCs leads to OTR-signaling elicited network suppression, i.e., hypofrontality, in male mPFC, which is relieved by inhibiting the ISR. Our findings present evidence in support of a sexually dimorphic role of prefrontal OTRCs in regulating emotional responses in anxiogenic environments, which goes awry in TSC. Our work has broader implications for developing effective treatments for subtypes of anxiety disorders that are characterized by cell-autonomous ISR and prefrontal network suppression.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

These communication patterns can be comprehensively mapped using noninvasive functional imaging, resulting in functional connectivity (FC) networks. Despite its popularity, FC is a statistical construct and its operational definition is arbitrary. While most studies use zero-lag Pearsons correlations by default, there exist hundreds of pairwise interaction statistics in the broader scientific literature that can be used to estimate FC. How the organization of the FC matrix varies with the choice of pairwise statistic is a fundamental methodological question that affects all studies in this rapidly growing field. Here we comprehensively benchmark the topological and geometric organization, neurobiological associations, and cognitive-behavioral relevance of FC matrices computed using a large library of 239 pairwise interaction statistics. We comprehensively investigate how canonical features of FC networks vary with the choice of pairwise statistic, including (1) hub mapping, (2) weight-distance trade-offs, (3) structure-function coupling, (4) correspondence with other neurophysiological networks, (5) individual fingerprinting, and (6) brain-behavior prediction. We find substantial quantitative and qualitative variation across FC methods. Throughout, we observe that measures such as covariance (full correlation), precision (partial correlation) and distance display multiple desirable properties, including close correspondence with structural connectivity, the capacity to differentiate individuals and to predict individual differences in behavior. Using information flow decomposition, we find that differences among FC methods may arise from differential sensitivity to the underlying mechanisms of inter-regional communication, with some more sensitive to redundant and some to synergistic information flow.

Effective antimicrobial therapy reduces complications and mortality; however, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in many endemic countries. Prevention through vaccination is possible through recently-licensed Gavi-supported typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs), and national immunisation programs are currently being considered or deployed in several countries where AMR prevalence is known to be high. Pathogen whole genome sequence data are a rich source of information on Typhi variants (genotypes or lineages), AMR prevalence, and mechanisms. However, this information is currently not readily accessible to non-genomics experts, including those driving vaccine implementation or empirical therapy guidance.

ResultsWe developed TyphiNET (https://www.typhi.net), an interactive online dashboard for exploring Typhi genotype and AMR distributions derived from publicly available pathogen genome sequences. TyphiNET allows users to explore country-level summaries such as the frequency of pathogen lineages, temporal trends in resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials, and the specific variants and mechanisms underlying emergent AMR trends. User-driven plots and session reports can be downloaded for ease of sharing. Importantly, TyphiNET is populated by high-quality genome data curated by the Global Typhoid Pathogen Genomics Consortium, analysed using the Pathogenwatch platform, and identified as coming from non-targeted sampling frames that are suitable for estimating AMR prevalence amongst Typhi infections (no personal data is included in the platform). As of February 2024, data from a total of n=11,836 genomes from 101 countries are available in TyphiNET. We outline case studies illustrating how the dashboard can be used to explore these data and gain insights of relevance to both researchers and public health policy-makers.

ConclusionsThe TyphiNET dashboard provides an interactive platform for accessing genome-derived data on pathogen variant frequencies to inform typhoid control and intervention strategies. The platform is extensible in terms of both data and features, and provides a model for making complex bacterial genome-derived data accessible to a wide audience.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

Previous research has uncovered symbiosis tradeoffs, including suppression of the NF-{kappa}B immune pathway in cnidarians hosting intracellular algae and correlations between symbiotic state and pathogen susceptibility. Here, we used a multiomic approach to characterize symbiotic states of the facultatively symbiotic coral Oculina arbuscula by generating genotype-controlled fragments of symbiotic and aposymbiotic tissue. Metabarcoding of 16S rRNA showed no difference in bacterial communities between symbiotic states. Consistent with previous whole-organism RNA-seq studies, whole-organism proteomics revealed differential abundance of proteins related to immunity, consistent with immune suppression during symbiosis. Moreover, single-cell RNAseq identified diverse cell clusters within six cell types across symbiotic states. Specifically, the gastrodermal cell cluster containing algal-hosting cells from symbiotic tissue had higher expression of nitrogen cycling and sugar transport genes than gastrodermal cells from aposymbiotic tissue. Furthermore, lower expression of genes involved in immune regulation, including NF-{kappa}B pathway genes, was observed in these gastrodermal cells from symbiotic tissue. However, no differences in gene expression in the immune cell cluster were observed between symbiotic states. This work reveals a compartmentalization of immune system suppression in specific gastrodermal cells in symbiosis, which likely limits symbiosis tradeoffs by dampening immunity in algal hosting cells while still maintaining general organismal immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

HARs include transcriptional enhancers with human-specific activity and have been implicated in the evolution of the human brain. However, our understanding of how HARs contributed to uniquely human features of the brain is hindered by a lack of insight into the genes and pathways that HARs regulate. It is unclear whether HARs acted by altering the expression of gene targets conserved between HARs and their chimpanzee orthologs or by gaining new gene targets in human, a mechanism termed enhancer hijacking. We generated a high-resolution map of chromatin interactions for 1,590 HARs and their orthologs in human and chimpanzee neural stem cells (NSCs) to comprehensively identify gene targets in both species. HARs and their chimpanzee orthologs targeted a conserved set of 2,963 genes enriched for neurodevelopmental processes including neurogenesis and synaptic transmission. Changes in HAR enhancer activity were correlated with changes in conserved gene target expression. Conserved targets were enriched among genes differentially expressed between human and chimpanzee NSCs or between human and non-human primate developing and adult brain. Species-specific HAR gene targets did not converge on known biological functions and were not significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes, suggesting that HARs did not alter gene expression via enhancer hijacking. HAR gene targets, including differentially expressed targets, also showed cell type-specific expression patterns in the developing human brain, including outer radial glia, which are hypothesized to contribute to human cortical expansion. Our findings support that HARs influenced human brain evolution by altering the expression of conserved gene targets and provide the means to functionally link HARs with novel human brain features.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393051

Episodic memory enables us to remember events from the past whereas spatial memory enables us to form a map-like representation of the environment. Interestingly, these seemingly different functions rely on the same brain structure: the hippocampus. Yet, how the hippocampus supports both at the same time remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypotheses that the hippocampus supports these two systems either via a common coding mechanism or via a parallel processing mechanism. To this end, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with an episodic life-simulation task and a spatial virtual reality task to manipulate episodic and spatial context associations of objects. We then investigated fMRI adaptation effects between these objects as a result of shared contexts. We found that the fMRI signal in the anterior hippocampus scaled with the combined prediction of shared episodic and spatial contexts, in line with the idea of a common coding mechanism. We found no evidence for a parallel processing mechanism, as there were no differences between episodic and spatial effects. The common coding effect for episodic and spatial memory dovetails with the broader notion of domain-general hippocampal cognitive maps.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

We then undertook mechanistic studies to test causality for the observed associations using the zebrafish larval Mycobacterium marinum infection model. Transcriptional profiling of human immune recall responses to tuberculin skin test (TST) challenge, a surrogate for immune responses to TB in the lung, revealed that type I interferon activity in the TST transcriptome was inversely associated with radiological disease severity. Abrogation of type I interferon signalling, achieved by CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis of stat2, led to increased susceptibility of zebrafish larvae to M. marinum infection, as a result of reduced recruitment of myeloid cells required to restrict mycobacterial growth, to the site of disease. Our data support a host protective role for type I interferon responses in mycobacterial infection, with potential applications for risk-stratification of adverse outcomes and development of a host-directed therapy to mitigate against severe disease.

However, the transition to high-definition ST significantly increased sparsity and dimensionality, posing computational challenges in discerning cell identities, understanding neighborhood structure, and identifying differential expression - all are crucial steps to study normal and disease ST samples. Here we present STHD, a novel machine learning method for probabilistic cell typing of single spots in whole-transcriptome, high-resolution ST data. Unlike current binning-aggregation-deconvolution strategy, STHD directly models gene expression at single-spot level to infer cell type identities. It addresses sparsity by modeling count statistics, incorporating neighbor similarities, and leveraging reference single-cell RNA-seq data. We demonstrated that STHD accurately predicts cell type identities at single-spot level, which automatically achieved precise segmentation of global tissue architecture and local multicellular neighborhoods. The STHD labels facilitated various downstream analyses, including cell type-stratified bin aggregation, spatial compositional comparison, and cell type-specific differential expression analyses. These high-resolution labels further defined frontlines of inter-cell type interactions, revealing direct cell-cell communication activities at immune hubs of a colon cancer sample.

In Ghana, no published studies have been conducted to evaluate the quality of COVID-19 data submitted onto the national web-based platform, District Health Information Management System version 2 (DHIMS-2) during the COVID-19 period. In this regard, this study seeks to assess the estimates and determinants of COVID-19 data quality in the DHIMS-2 in the Ahafo region of Ghana.

MethodsA facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed, with a desk review of COVID-19 records in DHIMS-2 and primary data sources (registers and monthly reporting forms). This study involved all 23 different levels of healthcare facilities that reported on COVID-19 in the Ahafo region from March 2020 to December 2022. We assessed COVID-19 data quality using three dimensions of completeness, accuracy, and timeliness according to the World Health Organization data quality guide. Mixed-effect logistic regression was then employed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 data quality at a 95% confidence interval.

ResultsThe overall COVID-19 data quality was estimated at 35.9% (95%CI=32.6%, 39.4%) while the rate of the data dimensions of timeliness, completeness, and accuracy were 50.2% (95%CI=46.7%, 53.8%), 50.6% (95%CI=47.1%, 54.2%), and 72.4% (95%CI=69.1%, 75.5%) respectively. It was found that the availability of a functional data validation team at the health facilities (AOR=18.3; 95%CI=1.62, 20.7; p= 0.019), training of data managers in COVID-19 data management (AOR=9.37; 95%CI=2.56, 34.3; p=0.001), and data managers with two-year professional training (certificate background) (AOR=3.42; 95%CI=1.95, 12.2; p=0.025) were independently associated with COVID-19 data quality.

ConclusionThe overall COVID-19 data quality in the Ahafo region was quite poor. Dimensionally, while the rate of data timeliness was high, that of data completeness, and accuracy were relatively low. The interaction of the independent correlates of COVID-19 data quality requires the healthcare system to identify stringent measures to strengthen the health information system to enhance planning and decision-making, especially during disease outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393051

However, unlike the interactions between chromatin segments, the strength of chromatin-lamina interactions and their dependence on cellular environment are not well understood. Here, we develop a theory to predict the size and shape of peripheral heterochromatin domains by considering the energetics of chromatin-chromatin interactions, the affinity between chromatin and the nuclear lamina and the kinetics of methylation and acetylation9in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Through the analysis of super-resolution images of peripheral heterochromatin domains using this theoretical framework, we determine the nuclear lamina-wide distribution of chromatin-lamina affinities. We find that the extracted affinity is highly spatially heterogeneous and shows a bimodal distribution, indicating regions along the lamina with strong chromatin binding and those exhibiting vanishing chromatin affinity interspersed with some regions exhibiting a relatively diminished chromatin interactions, in line with the presence of structures such as nuclear pores. Exploring the role of environmental cues on peripheral chromatin, we find that LAD thickness increases when hMSCs are cultured on a softer substrate, in correlation with contractility-dependent translocation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) from the cytosol to the nucleus. In soft microenvironments, chromatin becomes sequestered at the nuclear lamina, likely due to the interactions of HDAC3 with the chromatin anchoring protein LAP2{beta} ,increasing chromatin-lamina affinity, as well as elevated levels of the intranuclear histone methylation. Our findings are further corroborated by pharmacological interventions that inhibit contractility, as well as by manipulating methylation levels using epigenetic drugs. Notably, in the context of tendinosis, a chronic condition characterized by collagen degeneration, we observed a similar increase in the thickness of peripheral chromatin akin to that of cells cultured on soft substrates consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the microenvironment in shaping genome organization and highlight its relevance in pathological conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393051

These events constitute a nationwide trauma with major ramifications for public mental health. This article presents an evidence-based model for the prediction of the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to the terrorist attack and the war.

Main bodyThe creation of the model consisted of several steps. Firstly, the Israeli population was divided into six groups based on the intensity, context, and type of traumatic exposure (direct exposure to terror, close proximity to terror, soldiers in combat and support units, intense exposure to rocket attacks, moderate exposure to rocket attacks, and indirectly affected communities), and the population size of each group was assessed using official national databases. Secondly, an estimation of the expected prevalence of PTSD in each of the exposure groups was based on a review of the relevant literature. A random-effects meta-analysis of the prevalence rates was conducted separately per each exposure group. Finally, the predicted number of PTSD causalities in the population was calculated by multiplying the group size and the PTSD prevalence estimation. Based on population size and estimated PTSD prevalence within each exposure category, the model predicts that approximately 5.3% (N=519,923) of the Israeli population (95% prediction interval, 160,346-879,502), may develop PTSD as a result of the terrorist attack and the war.

ConclusionsThe predicted number of individuals with PTSD following mass trauma is expected to be considerable. The presented model can assist policymakers, clinicians, and researchers in preparing and devising adequate interventions for the mental health needs of large populations. Moreover, this model can be applied in other instances of mass-trauma exposure.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393051

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface and to a new and highly relevant livestock species, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1719612393051

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393051

Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates.

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1719612393051

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1719612393051
