The physical principles guiding this centromere positioning remain unknown. Here, we reveal that human core centromeres are directed to the chromatin surface by repulsion of centromere-associated proteins - independent of condensin-mediated loop extrusion and microtubule engagement. Using cellular perturbations, biochemical reconstitution, and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations, we show that chromatin surface localisation emerges from repulsion between condensed chromatin and both the kinetochore and the highly negatively charged centromere protein, CENP-B. Together, these elements form a centromeric region composed of two domains with opposing affinities, one favouring integration within the mitotic chromosome and the other favouring exposure to the surrounding cytoplasm, thereby driving surface positioning. Tethering synthetic negatively charged proteins to chromatin was sufficient to recapitulate this surface localisation in cells and in vitro, indicating that electrostatic repulsion is a key determinant of surface localisation. These findings demonstrate that centromere layering is not hardwired by chromatin folding patterns but instead emerges from phase separation in chromatin. Our work uncovers electrostatic polarity as a general and programmable mechanism to spatially organise chromatin.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Although numerous photo-crosslinking approaches have been successfully employed, they often suffer from common limitations, including low reaction yields, the need for long exposure times, and irradiation-induced cellular damage from heat, desiccation, or side reactions. We recently showed that 365 nm light-emitting diodes (LEDs) enable rapid, bioorthogonal protein-DNA crosslinking in living cells, incurring minimal photodamage. Here we generalize this approach and demonstrate that high-intensity, longwave UV light reduces the irradiation time for in-cell photo-crosslinking reactions by up to 1000-fold, allowing protein-drug, protein-protein, protein-DNA and protein-RNA interactions to be fixed within seconds. Benchmarking this rapid photo-activation for the analysis of RNA-interacting proteomes responding to RNA-binding drugs, we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative advantages of controlled, high-intensity UV irradiation, uncovering emergent experimental opportunities that were previously inaccessible to light-activated chemistry in intact cells and tissues.","[{""name"":""German Research Foundation (DFG)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""492625837;""},{""name"":""Bavarian Research Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AZ-1444-20C;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Here we show that two major lineages of fungi, Glomeromycotina and Microsporidia, lost DNA polymerase complexes involved in replication and translesion synthesis. Catalytic and non-catalytic subunits of DNA polymerases are co-eliminated, consistent with their physical and functional interactions described in other eukaryotes. We detect lineage-specific variation in genome-wide mutation rates, showing that DNA polymerase gene losses correlate with increased genetic variation. We find that the Glomeraceae family of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi has lived for ~360 My without a leading strand replisome, raising the question of how these fungi can replicate DNA. We provide evidence that the cell cycle of Rhizophagus irregularis is active when in symbiosis with a host, but not without. This indicates a higher level of integration between AM fungi and plants than previously appreciated, and suggests the existence of a regulatory or functional contribution provided by a host to the fungal cell cycle. We propose that alternative modes of DNA replication and cell cycle provide mutational opportunities for fungal adaptation, and play roles in the evolution of endosymbioses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

These phenotypes persist through the night phases, suggesting a readiness for the daylight environment that is routinely experienced despite the intervening dark periods (Dupuis & Ojeda et al. 2025). Here, we investigate how prior acclimation impacts algal fitness upon a change in daylight intensity and how quickly Chlamydomonas can reprogram its photoprotective strategy in a diurnal context. We performed a systems analysis of synchronized populations acclimated to diurnal LL when subjected to HL days and of populations acclimated to diurnal HL when subjected to LL days. In the latter case, diurnal photoacclimation decreased fitness during the first day at a new light intensity: HL-acclimated cells barely increased in size over the first LL period, and they failed to complete a cell cycle. However, although LL-acclimated cells showed severe photodamage after 6 hours of HL, they recovered chloroplast form and function later that afternoon and successfully divided at nightfall. These cells rapidly altered their thylakoid membrane ultrastructure, increased their photoprotective quenching capacity, and decreased their inventory of photosystem and antenna proteins by the end of the first HL day. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed rapid induction of thousands of genes, including those encoding proteases, chaperones, and other proteins involved in the chloroplast unfolded protein response. These results show that the alga is highly flexible and competent to rapidly acclimate to changes in diurnal light intensity.","[{""name"":""Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006wxqw41"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GBMF9203;""},{""name"":""US Department of Energy Office of Science"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Office of Biological and Environmental Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0114b2m14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE-AC05-76RL01830;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1S10OD025063;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

A small proportion of stem cells avoid the mutational damage caused by carcinogens in tobacco and are more abundant in the lungs of former smokers than ongoing smokers, indicating unexplained tissue-level genomic recovery. This mirrors epidemiological risk, which falls rapidly after quitting smoking. Somatic evolutionary mechanistic hypotheses have been proposed to explain these observations. Here, we present a computational framework to model each of these hypotheses within the upper airway epithelial stem cell population over the entire patient lifetimes of a cohort with diverse smoking histories. Applying a mechanistic learning approach based on a set of biologically informed metrics to single cell-derived whole-genome sequencing data, we identified subtle differences between epithelia modelled under different combinations of hypotheses. A slow-cycling subpopulation of stem cells, combined with suppression of immune predation of highly mutated stem cells while smoking, best matched observed data, a result converged upon by multiple distinct machine learning methodologies. Our findings, drawing on an evolutionary model of mutagen exposure at a whole-lifetime scale that is not feasible to model in vivo, reveal the mechanisms behind reduction in lung squamous cell carcinoma risk on cessation of smoking and inform future therapeutic interventions to prevent lung cancer initiation.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/W025051/1;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research UK"",""id"":""https://ror.org/054225q67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EDDCPGM100002;CDEPIL-Jan24/100032;C11496/A30025;DRCPFA-Nov23/100003;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/P034616/1;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219478/Z/19/Z;211179/Z/18/Z;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UF130039;""},{""name"":""UCL Hospitals Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05mz0pr34"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Rosetrees Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04e3zg361"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UCL Biomedical Research Centre"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03r9qc142"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Due to the lack of an internal protein synthesis machinery, they entirely depend on the import of target proteins to carry out their functions within peroxisomes. While the process of cargo/receptor recognition is well understood, knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the subsequent translocation steps, including cargo release and receptor recycling, is lacking behind. Here, we provide structural and functional evidence on the role of Pex8 in these processes. First, we show that Pex8 in yeast is essential for peroxisomal cargo translocation, irrespective of the mechanism of receptor/cargo recognition. Next, we reveal that Pex8 binds through an irregular twelvefold HEAT repeat array to a short three-helical bundle within the otherwise unfolded N-terminal domain of the Pex5 receptor. Impairing this interaction abolishes peroxisomal protein translocation. It is complemented by a secondary autonomous Pex8 cargo-like interaction site with the C-terminal domain of Pex5, thus generating a bipartite interaction between the two proteins. Our data support a model in which Pex5/Pex8 complex formation allows assembly with the peroxisomal Pex2/Pex10/Pex12 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to initiate recycling of the receptor. In summary, our findings provide in-depth insight into the transition from cargo release into peroxisomes to receptor recycling, which is essential to uncover the overall process of the peroxisomal cargo translocation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Using deep PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing, combined with reference-guided scaffolding based on near-complete C. speciosa genome, we generated assemblies of 259.1 Mbp (C. itosakura) and 312.6 Mbp (C. jamasakura), with both >98% BUSCO completeness. Consistent with their natural histories, C. itosakura showed low heterozygosity, while C. jamasakura displayed high genomic diversity. Comparative genomic analyses revealed structural variations, including large chromosomal inversions. Notably, the availability of both the previously published C. speciosa genome and our new C. itosakura genome enabled the reconstruction of proxy haplotypes for both parental lineages of 'Somei-yoshino'.

However, the efficacy of VERG varies across species. In this study, we tested two commonly used viral vectors, barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) and foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV), for their ability to induce virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) in rice (Oryza sativa L.). While both vectors successfully altered gene expression in wheat (Triticum aestivum), they failed to do so in six rice cultivars from different subspecies, despite rigorous optimization of inoculation methods and environmental conditions. The BSMV vector carrying antisense phytoene desaturase (PDS) sequences did not induce the expected photobleaching phenotype, and FoMV-driven GFP expression was absent in rice. These findings contrast with previous reports of successful VERG in other monocots and suggest that intrinsic resistance mechanisms exist in rice which may inhibit or reduce viral vector efficacy. Our results highlight the species-specific limitations of VERG and underscore the need for alternative viral systems or novel vector designs for functional genomics research in rice. By sharing our unsuccessful attempts, we aim to prevent redundant efforts and encourage further exploration of VERG in Oryza species.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of the United Kingdom (BBSRC)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X010953/1; BBS/E/RH/230003A;""},{""name"":""Institutional Internationalization Program (PRINT) from Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Rio Grande do Sul State Research Support Foundation (FAPERGS)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22/2551-0000394-0/RITES;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Several lysine methyltransferases which methylate non-histone substrates are overexpressed in a number of cancers and are believed to be key drivers of cancer progression. There is great incentive to identify the lysine methylome, as this is a key step in identifying drug targets. While numerous computational models have been developed in the last decade to identify novel lysine methylation sites, the accuracy of these model has been modest, leaving much room for improvement. In this work, we leverage the most recent advancements in deep learning and present a transformer-based model for lysine methylation site prediction which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.

Using public long-read sequencing data from 2,668 donors, we build a near-complete map of common alleles in TCR V, D, and J genes, revealing amino acid variation at almost every position within V genes. We discover pervasive evidence of natural selection on TCR genes, including balancing selection on a TRAJ gene recognizing an immunodominant influenza epitope and positive selection on a TRAV gene. We find TCR allelic polymorphism alters core functional properties of T cells, including thymic fate commitment, phenotypes in diseased tissues, and cell-surface receptor abundance. Collectively, our findings position inherited variation in TCR genes as a key axis of immunological diversity that may shape interindividual differences in immune responses.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Hordeum erectifolium, a wild relative of barley (H. vulgare), is adapted to intermittent and prolonged drought and saline soils, making it an excellent model for stress-adaptation research. We assembled a chromosome-scale, annotated reference genome of H. erectifolium comprising 3.85 Gbp, and identified 71,475 genes supported by a tissue-specific gene expression atlas. Comparative morphological, physiological, and transcriptomic analyses under water limitation were conducted with cultivated and wild barley. H. erectifolium displayed a greater density of leaf veins and sclerenchyma cells, alongside rapid leaf rolling upon dehydration. Genomic comparisons revealed structural variations, independent transposon-driven evolution, and copy number expansions of desiccation-responsive gene families relative to barley. The transcriptional responses of H. erectifolium and barley to water limitation suggested contrasting drought-adaptation strategies: metabolic downregulation and survival prioritization in H. erectifolium versus maintenance of metabolic activity and competitiveness in barley. Our data suggest that H. erectifolium is genetically primed for survival under drought through anatomical adaptations, gene family expansion, efficient shutdown of growth-related metabolism, and rapid recovery upon rehydration.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101002085;949873;""},{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390686111;456082119;252965955;""},{""name"":""ERDF Programme Johannes Amos Comenius"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CZ.02.01.01/00/22_008/0004581;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

We aimed to map the production of scientific publications worldwide in terms of democracy and freedom of press ratings of countries. Democracy ratings used the Democracy Index in 2024 and in 2006 (when first released by the Economist Intelligence Unit) and Freedom of Press ratings used the 2024 index by Reports Without Borders. The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press. Proportions of publications originated from countries with problematic or worse situations were 81%, 91%, 61%, 62%, and 63% for political, economic, legislative, sociocultural, and safety/security dimensions, respectively. Results were similar when limited to articles published in 2024 in journals with continuous annual presence in Scopus during 2006-2024. In conclusion, most published science originates from countries struggling or suffering in democracy and/or freedom of press. The deeper causes and implications of this emerging landscape require further study.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.","[{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MURI N00014-23-1-2768;MURI W911NF2410228;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01MH131715-01;R01MH11559;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21AG077275-01A1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756937306215
