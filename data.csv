'synthetic proteins') has unlocked new frontiers of protein design. Deep learning models trained on protein sequences and experimental structures can generate novel protein designs that explore structural landscapes unseen by evolution. This approach enables the development of bespoke binders that target specific proteins and domains through new protein-protein interactions. However, successful binder generation can suffer from low in silico success rates, often requiring thousands of designs and hundreds of GPU hours to obtain enough hits for experimental testing. While commercial web-apps and workstation implementations are available for binder design, these are limited in both scalability and throughput. There is a lack of efficient open-source protein design pipelines for high-performance computing (HPC) systems that can maximise hardware resources and parallelise the workflow efficiently to generate successful binders. Here, we present 'ProteinDJ' - an implementation of a synthetic protein design workflow that is deployable on HPC systems using the Nextflow portable workflow management system and Apptainer containerisation. It automatically batches and parallelises the workload across both GPUs and CPUs, facilitating generation and testing of hundreds of designs per hour, dramatically accelerating the discovery process. Importantly, it allows central deployment of the workflow on shared HPC resources, rather than workstations restricted to individual research groups. ProteinDJ is designed to be modular and currently includes RoseTTAFold Diffusion (RFdiffusion) for fold generation, ProteinMPNN or Full-Atom MPNN (FAMPNN) for sequence design, and AlphaFold2 or Boltz-2 for prediction and validation of designs and binder-target interfaces, with supporting packages for structural evaluation of designs. We have included structure-based filters to reject problematic designs mid-stream to minimise manual inspection of designs by the user. ProteinDJ democratises protein binder design through its robust and user-friendly implementation and provides a framework for future protein design software pipelines.","[{""name"":""Australian National Health and Medical Research Council"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2008096;2026643;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Mechanotransduction feedback loops convert mechanical forces into gene-expression changes that, in turn, regulate cell behaviors such as growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. How these loops are coupled to developmental programs to ensure robust morphogenetic outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Yap-dependent mechanotransduction establishes a self-limiting positive feedback loop that drives the successful formation of semicircular canals in zebrafish. These canals form through reproducible steps of bud initiation, extension, and fusion within the otic epithelium. Local swelling of a hyaluronan-rich ECM initiates bud formation. We demonstrate that this ECM expansion activates Yap in a spatially patterned manner within the bud. Activated Yap induces its target, ccn1l1, which drives further ECM production, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ensuing rapid ECM expansion sustains bud extension. Graded perturbations to the mechanotransduction loop reduced extension, with bud fusion remaining robust at lower levels of disruption but blocked at the highest dose. Critically, the loop contains its own termination mechanism: when buds fuse, the PKA-CREB signaling is activated by the adhesion GPCR Gpr126 to suppress ccn1l1, preventing overgrowth. These findings reveal how mechanotransduction-driven positive feedback loops can be coupled to their own termination, providing developmental control through the integration of mechanical forces with transcriptional responses and morphogenetic outcomes.","[{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00HD098918;DP2115157;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006zn3t30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AR083346;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Uehara Memorial Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00gc20a07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

The integration of the Multistep L-TEAM with the TWJ method achieves high sensitivity, detecting miRNA at concentrations as low as 10 femtomolar within 50 minutes, and effectively distinguishes single-nucleotide mismatches. When CRISPR-Cas3-mediated reaction was integrated, it still proved effective for confirming the presence of the target, but its quantitative reliability requires further optimization. We developed a predictive model using machine learning to facilitate rational optimization of experimental conditions through contribution analysis and to establish a methodology for designing more favorable sequences.

To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haughey's Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex. Genomic data recovered from a Haughey's Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Their co-immunoprecipitation and overlapping loss-of-function phenotypes suggest joint function, yet how they co-regulate target mRNAs remains unclear. Here, we developed Tandem PAR-CLIP and identified a DND1-NANOS3 ribonucleoprotein that specifically recognizes an AUGAAUU heptanucleotide on target mRNAs, termed the NANOS3-dependent DND1 Recognition Element (N3-DRE). mRNAs containing 3'UTR N3-DREs are aberrantly upregulated in DND1- or NANOS3-deficient germ cells and encode key cell-cycle and epigenome regulators, such as CDK1. Genome editing showed that the N3-DRE is essential for Cdk1 repression in mouse PGCs in vivo. A 1.7-[A] crystal structure of the ternary complex of DND1, NANOS3, and CDK1-N3-DRE RNA revealed a continuous RNA-binding surface that confers high-affinity, sequence-specific recognition. Together, these findings define the molecular and functional basis of N3-DRE-mediated mRNA regulation in germ cell development. Moreover, we provide a paradigm of two RNA-binding proteins with low (DND1) or no (NANOS3) intrinsic sequence-specificity, jointly building a high-information-content RNA sequence motif that is different from the sum of their individual preferences. Because RNA-binding protein specificities are typically studied individually, rather than in the context of ribonucleoproteins, this type of two-factor authorization may be an underappreciated mechanism to protect posttranscriptional gene regulatory networks from aberrant expression of an individual ribonucleoprotein component.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006zn3t30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00j4k1h63"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

However, limited genomic data from individuals dating between 45,000 and 20,000 years ago still restricts our understanding of population dynamics and admixture during the Upper Palaeolithic. Before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5 to 19 cal kya), Gravettian culture-associated populations were widespread and genetically diverse, comprising at least two distinct genetic groups, referred to as the Fournol and Vestonice clusters. We present genome-wide data from three Gravettian-associated individuals: two from cave sites in the Franco-Cantabrian region (Chufin and Isturitz) and one from Italy (Ostuni1b). These data reveal previously undetected gene flow linking the ancestry of 34,000-year-old individuals from Sungir (Russia) to Gravettian individuals from Western Europe, challenging the prevailing model of population continuity from the Aurignacian to the Solutrean. As osseous remains are scarce for this time period, DNA from sediments deposited by ancient humans opens a new possibility to obtain genomic data. We thus examine sedimentary DNA from Solutrean Layer 122 at El Miron Cave (Cantabria, ~22,000 cal BP), recovering approximately 16,000 human SNPs, among the highest yields reported from a Palaeolithic context. Generating these data required over 1.15 billion sequencing reads, illustrating both the potential of sediment DNA for autosomal analysis and the technical challenges of the approach.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Computational models suggest that insects remember panoramic snapshots to return to goal locations. To what extent these snapshots represent retinotopic images or whether salient landmarks are stored isolated from the panorama remains unclear. With a newly designed spatial-memory task, we show that honeybees employ two different strategies for learning visual cues. In essence, they learn visual patterns as panoramic snapshots and three-dimensional objects as single entities. Freely walking honeybees were challenged to locate a rewarded feeder in the presence of visual patterns or objects. Selectively perturbing the panorama degraded the orientation behaviour only when visual patterns were present but not when objects were available. Presenting visual patterns and objects simultaneously and setting these cues in conflict revealed that honeybees primarily rely on a landmark-based navigation strategy. Making the spatial information of the objects ambiguous did not induce disorientation because the honeybees then relied on the visual patterns for finding the feeder. Altogether, our results suggest two independent visual memories operating in parallel, one dedicated to local landmarks and a second one for visual patterns that could be interpreted as distal cues. Notably, in rats, the spatial tuning of some hippocampal cells has been shown to be either anchored to local or distal cues. Our results provide the first hints that a distinction between local and distal cues may also be present in the insect brain.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BE 8388/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data. METHODS The KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin). Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates). RESULTS The rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV025280, INV077266;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""226432/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773830;""},{""name"":""Trond Mohn Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TMF2019TMT03;""},{""name"":""SARA project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Africa, through a grant from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs within the Fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Health Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UK Vietnam MRC Newton Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/N029399/1 RG83380;""},{""name"":""National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

We found that information from multiple innately aversive and attractive sensory modalities converges onto a common output neuron of the learning circuit, specifically the Mushroom Body output neuron, MBON-m1. We discovered that this neuron is required for navigating both attractive odor and aversive temperature cues and is activated by attractive cues, such as food odour and sugar, and inhibited by different aversive cues, such as cooling, salt, or non-food odors.

However, harnessing this variation for agriculture hinges on our ability to detect, quantify, catalog, and utilize genetic diversity. {middle dot} Here, we explore seven complete genomes of the emerging biofuel crop pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) drawn from across the species's current genetic diversity to catalogue variation in genome structure and content. {middle dot} Across this new pangenome resource, we find contrasting evolutionary modes in different genomic regions. Gene-poor, repeat-rich pericentromeric regions experience frequent rearrangements, including repeated centromere repositioning. In contrast, conserved gene-dense chromosome arms maintain large-scale synteny across accessions, even in fast-evolving immune genes where microsynteny breaks down across species but the macrosynteny of gene cluster positioning is maintained. {middle dot} Our findings highlight that multiple elements of the genome experience dynamic evolution that conserves functional content on the chromosome scale but allows rearrangement and presence-absence variation on a local scale. This diversity is invisible to classical reference-based approaches and highlights the strength and utility of pangenomic resources.

Although these lesions comprised only 0.2% of the epithelial compartment, they displayed geographic diversity, immune exclusion, metabolic rewiring, and DNA copy number changes among lesions and normal fallopian tube epithelium discovered alterations in STIC-associated genes and the pathways they control.

This was first made possible by fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (Fucci) technology, which distinguishes specific cell cycle phases through the reciprocal degradation of fluorescently tagged, truncated forms of human CDT1 and GMNN proteins. Fucci genetic systems have been successfully implemented in transgenic mice, zebrafish, and axolotls. To date, no viable, stably expressing Fucci line has been developed in an avian species. Although a range of continuously improving Fucci constructs have been developed in recent years, existing in vivo Fucci models remain limited because they rely on older reporter technology that fails to distinguish cells in S, G2, and M phases or to label cells in early G1. As a result, these models can be challenging to interpret and their utility for continuous cell tracking and precise analysis of cell-cycle dynamics is limited. Here, we introduce FuChi, a multicistronic Fucci-expressing chicken line incorporating a newly optimised reporter construct comprising of an mCerulean-tagged Histone H1.0 linker protein fused via a self-cleaving 2A peptide to the tandem Fucci(CA) cell cycle biosensor, with additional epitope tags included for detection in fixed tissues. We show that this system accurately discriminates and tracks cells in G1, S, G2, and M phases both in vitro and in vivo, enabling faithful visualisation of cell cycle status in intact tissues and organs. Using FuChi embryos, we mapped proliferation dynamics across developing tissues, analysed cell cycle states of migrating cells, and performed live imaging of early embryos. These latter experiments revealed that transition from S phase may be a key morphogenetic event during gastrulation as mesendoderm cells egress from the primitive streak to form embryonic structures including the prechordal plate. Pairing this advanced reporter with the intrinsic experimental advantages of the chicken embryo, positions FuChi as a premier in vivo system for studying cell-cycle kinetics in development, delivering clear technological improvements over current Fucci models. FuChi chickens provide a powerful new resource for studying embryonic development, organ growth, tissue homeostasis, disease processes, and infection responses.","[{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/D/10002071;BBS/E/RL/230001C;""},{""name"":""National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02w0kg036"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NC/T002328/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

While tiller bud formation is primarily under strong genetic control, bud outgrowth into functional tillers is strongly influenced by physiological and environmental cues. However, integration of environmental cues to genetic regulators for controlling tiller outgrowth remains poorly understood. Nitrogen availability is one of the most critical environmental factors regulating tiller outgrowth. Therefore, we investigated the effects of Nitrogen on the early stages of bud outgrowth and dissected the genetic module mediating nitrogen-mediated tiller outgrowth. Both nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) triggered tiller outgrowth and induced largely overlapping transcriptional responses, although nitrate acted with a temporal delay. Phytohormone signaling emerged as the central interface linking nitrogen supply to the early stages of bud outgrowth, with cytokinin - auxin antagonism playing a key role. Cytokinin promoted bud outgrowth by repressing the TCP transcription factor OsTB1, the key inhibitor of tillering, via Cytokinin Response Factors OsERF53/54. OsERF53/54 further reduced polar auxin transport by repressing OsPIN1a, which in turn, promoted bud activation. Conversely, auxin promoted bud dormancy by inducing OsTB1 and OsPIN1a via OsARF11/16. Adequate nitrogen supplies induced cytokinin signaling while inhibiting auxin signaling and transport in tiller buds, thereby triggering bud outgrowth. Together, we identify a key regulatory role of auxin cytokinin antagonistic module for integrating nitrogen signals to determine tiller bud fate.","[{""name"":""Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BT/Ag/Network/Rice/2019–20;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaeotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that {Delta}dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that {Delta}dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that {Delta}dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt. Altogether, these findings expand our knowledge of the Dma familys role in OMV biogenesis and demonstrates their importance in Bacteroides physiology.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors.

The repressed var genes have a distinct genome organization where they localize as a cluster near the nuclear periphery and are bound by PfHP1 (P. falciparum Heterochromatin Protein 1). However, the mode of regulation of var genes by PfHP1 remains unclear. In this study, we show that PfHP1 undergoes phase separation in vitro in an RNA and DNA-dependent manner. Single-molecule DNA tethering experiments further revealed that AT-rich DNA sequences act as nucleation sites for the assembly and compaction of PfHP1-mediated heterochromatinization. We have also identified point mutations in the IDRs (intrinsically disordered regions) of PfHP1 that disrupt its phase separation as well as DNA compaction in vitro. To assess the dynamic properties of PfHP1 condensates in vivo, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in GFP tagged PfHP1 parasites, which revealed rapid fluorescence recovery, supporting their fluidity and phase separation behaviour. Ectopic expression of PfHP1 phase separation and DNA compaction mutants led to dispersed nuclear localization of PfHP1, in contrast to the punctate appearance of the wild-type protein and altered chromatin binding at var genes. These results were corroborated with DiCre/loxP-based conditional expression of the same PfHP1 mutants, which also led to the de-repression of multiple var genes (as many as 54 out of 60 var genes), mimicking the phenotype of PfHP1 depletion mutants. Hi-C sequencing of PfHP1 mutants revealed loss of interactions in the heterochromatic regions, indicating that PfHP1 phase separation is an essential mechanism for repressive cluster formation.

Modelling approaches have enabled researchers to traverse the vast search space of genetic circuits more efficiently, while machine learning has proven useful for designing parts and predicting their function or evolutionary properties. Generative algorithms have the potential to leverage these features to design entire genetic circuits from the sequence level, but have only recently begun to be applied to synthetic biological applications. Here, we show that even simple generative models like the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) can produce novel genetic circuits that match complex dynamic functions such as signal adaptation. Using in silico RNA simulation, we construct a dataset of RNA sequences and convert them to circuits via RNA interaction predictors, allowing us to estimate functional features alongside evolutionary stability and interpret model-learned features. Our model generates diverse distributions of circuits that match their target adaptation specification well, even when limited to small training data sets. Structures in the embedding space correspond to motifs previously identified as crucial for adaptation and reflect the design rules for adaptable circuits. Framing adaptation as a single design objective outperforms other input representations, reflecting the importance of choosing the correct data encoding for generating genetic circuits.

However, scaffolds that recruit kinases to subcellular locations and promote signal transduction have only been described in few species. Notably, no scaffold was thought necessary for the MAPK cascade promoting sexual differentiation in fission yeast. Here, we identify the hemi-arrestin protein Sms1 as a structurally novel scaffold of this MAPK cascade. Interactions with PIP2 and the pheromone receptor-coupled G subunit target Sms1 to plasma membrane patches, where it assembles the active cascade by binding each MAP kinase. These interactions are essential for signal transduction and local signal interpretation for polarised growth. Phosphorylation, including by the MAPK itself, antagonises Sms1 membrane translocation, establishing a negative feedback that underlies polarity patch turnover and prevents untimely mating attempts. Thus, Sms1 is a MAPK scaffold with canonical functions despite its distinct structural fold, highlighting convergent evolution of MAPK scaffolds across eukaryotes.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""176396;191990;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SexYeast;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

One major way in which eukaryotic cells sense their surroundings is via G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), which share a seven-transmembrane architecture and G-protein-mediated downstream signaling. While mammalian GPCRs are well-characterized and represent important drug targets, their fungal counterparts remain poorly understood. In the corn pathogen Ustilago maydis, we now uncover a GPCR-based mechanism that allows the fungus to scout the host environment to sense whether it has entered into the plant tissue. During infection, the fungus secretes the protein Pit2, which is cleaved by host apoplastic-cysteine proteases, releasing a peptide ligand hidden within Pit2. This ligand activates the fungal GPCR Gpe1 strongly promoting fungal proliferation after initial host penetration. Comparative analyses reveal conservation of the Gpe1/Pit2 system, with co-evolutionary signatures preserving receptor-ligand specificity. Furthermore, this GPCR system recognizing hidden peptide ligands shows conceptual similarities to the fungal pheromone mating system, without sharing sequence similarity. Our findings reveal a co-evolved mechanism between fungus and host that encodes environmental context into a protein scaffold, establishing a novel paradigm for host-dependent signaling with implications for inter-organismic communication.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""390686111;458090666;551864487;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MPS-NITMB-00005320;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Here, we use computational analysis and modeling to show that connectivity asymmetry supports high working-memory capacity, whereas increasing reciprocity reduces memory capacity and representational diversity in reservoir-computing models of recurrent neural networks. We systematically examine synthetic architectures inspired by mammalian cortical connectivity and find that sparse, modular, and hierarchical networks achieve superior performance, relative to random, small-world, or core-periphery graphs, but only when reciprocity is constrained. Validated on directed macaque and marmoset connectomes, these results indicate that restricting reciprocal motifs yields functional benefits in sparse networks, consistent with an evolutionary strategy for stable, efficient information processing in the brain.

Despite this, the high dimensionality of molecular representations greatly complicates its sampling, analysis, and visualization. A popular approach to overcome problem is to project these representations to a ""human-manageable"" subspace, usually containing only two dimensions. Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques are by far the preferred strategy, following the reasoning that their flexibility can accommodate any arbitrary distribution originally present in the high-dimensional space. However, this ignores the elevated computational cost of these methods and the difficulty in tuning their hyper-parameters. Here, we show that basic properties of the metrics used in the original space can be used to infer the shape of the chemical space, which in turns suggests an optimal strategy to project chemical information to lower dimensions. The key insight is to realize that, no matter the set of molecules, their fingerprint representation can be considered to lie on a hyper-spherical surface. The smooth nature of this manifold means that we can use clustering to identify locally-dense sectors of chemical space, and selectively project them simply using linear (hyper-parameter free) methods, like principal component analysis. This approach surpasses non-linear techniques in several neighborhood preservation metrics, while only requiring a fraction of the computational cost.

Using bispecific antibodies to target anti-PD-1 to individual T cell subsets, we demonstrate that intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can independently drive immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that respond to anti-PD-1 exhibit a shared dysfunctional gene program, characterized by tumor-reactivity, terminal exhaustion, effector capacity, and reduced translational activity.

Here, we utilize all-atom molecular dynamics computer simulations to elucidate the binding mechanisms of an hIAPP aggregation inhibitor (YX-I-1) and an aggregation accelerator (YX-A-1) to disordered monomers of wild-type hIAPP and the naturally occurring pathogenic S20G hIAPP variant associated with early-onset T2D.

We dissect the interactions that stabilize binding of each molecule to wild-type and S20G hIAPP and characterize conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding. In all ligand-bound ensembles, distinct fragments of YX-I-1 and YX-A-1 are sequestered from solvent upon binding while other fragments remain solvent-exposed.

Here we review and evaluate contemporary methods for detecting CCMs in aquatic plants. Physiological methods including gas exchange and isotopic analyses provide valuable insights in terrestrial plants but face significant challenges in aquatic systems. Biochemical assays of organic acid accumulation reliably detect CCMs in aquatic species but may struggle to detect weak or non-canonical CCMs in submerged plants.

While adaptive in natural environments, these responses can lower yield and increase susceptibility to stress in agricultural systems. We tested whether soybean breeding over the past century has altered shade avoidance and associated trade-offs. Twenty-one Canadian cultivars released between 1922 and 2018 were grown in pots under either control or shade-avoidance-inducing light conditions, achieved by altering reflected light spectrum without reducing photosynthetic radiation. Plants exposed to shade-avoidance inducing light grew taller and suffered greater thrips damage, consistent with expectations of increased stem elongation and reduced defense. More recent cultivars showed higher susceptibility to thrips than older ones. Breeding progress in seed yield was driven largely by greater biomass allocation to seeds and a reduction in branching. However, under shade-inducing light, the yield improvements were smaller, pointing to shade avoidance as a limiting factor. Our results indicate that while soybean breeding has improved yield and shifted morphology towards ideotypes suited for high-density stands, persistent shade avoidance responses constrain breeding progress and increase herbivore susceptibility. Breeding strategies that reduce sensitivity to neighbor cues may therefore improve soybean productivity and resilience.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192537;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Typically, lysosomes are globular in morphology. However, in activated macrophages exposed to lipopolysaccharides, lysosomes undergo a dramatic reorganization to expand and become tubular in morphology. This tubulation phenomenon requires microtubules and dynein and kinesin motor activities regulated by lysosomal Rab7 and Arl8b GTPases. A key property of lysosomes is their acidic milieu established by the V-ATPase; the acidic gradient across the lysosomal membrane is ideal for hydrolytic activity, but this also powers other functions including membrane transport. Here, we sought to determine if V-ATPase and the acidic lysosomal pH were important for LPS-mediated lysosome tubulation in macrophages. We found that disruption of the V-ATPase prevented lysosome tubulation and collapsed preformed tubules. However, the V-ATPase also controls mTORC1 activity, which we previously showed promotes tubulation. In comparison, alkalization with NH4Cl did not interfere with mTORC1 activity, and yet, this also prevented lysosome tubulation. Moreover, clamping the pH to either acidic or alkaline values caused tubules to collapse, indicating that the gradient across the membrane is required for tubulation, rather than a specific pH value. Dissipation of lysosomal pH did not alter global microtubule organization, nor did it cause a collapse of lysosome movement, suggesting that motors remained associated with lysosomes. Interestingly, while LPS did not alter the global lysosomal pH nor the average pH of spherical and tubular lysosomes, we observed that growing tubules typically had a more acidic peripheral tip. We propose that localized gradients of acidic pH across the lysosomal membrane may directly or indirectly coordinate motor activity to enable tubulation.","[{""name"":""Canadian Institutes of Health Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gavpb45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PJT-166047;PJT-197934;""},{""name"":""Canada Foundation for Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000az4664"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32957;38151;""},{""name"":""Canada Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0517h6h17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""950-232333;""},{""name"":""Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation, and Trade"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""38151;""},{""name"":""Toronto Metropolitan University"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05g13zd79"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

They enable compositional generalization, a mechanism that could explain the brain's adaptability, where independent modules representing different parts of the environment can be selected according to context. We trained an RNN to predict future frames in a visual environment defined by independent latent factors and their corresponding dynamics. We found that the network learned to solve this task by developing a compositional internal model. Specifically, it had disentangled representations of the static latent factors, and formed distinct, modular clusters, each selectively implementing a single dynamic. This modular and disentangled architecture enabled the network to exhibit compositional generalization, accurately predicting outcomes in novel contexts composed of unseen combinations of dynamics. Our findings present a powerful, unsupervised mechanism for learning the causal structure of an environment, suggesting that predicting the future can be sufficient to develop generalizable world models.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

In sexually reproducing populations, the challenge of finding mates at low densities can impose a strong demographic Allee effect. When such a population falls below the Allee threshold, either through a reduction of the population size or an increase in the threshold, successful adaptation relies on overcoming the Allee effect, which gets increasingly difficult as the population declines. Despite mate-finding Allee effects being common, most models of evolutionary rescue assume that mating is assured even at low densities. Here, we set up a population genetic model for evolutionary rescue of a population below its Allee threshold. For the analysis, we combine stochastic computer simulations with mathematical arguments. As expected, mate limitation can severely impede rescue but the extent differs across sexual systems. We further show that mate limitation shifts the optimal sex ratio for dioecious populations, alters optimal evolutionary routes when there are trade-offs between increasing mate-finding efficiency and fecundity, and enhances the importance of standing genetic variation relative to de novo mutants. Overall, our results highlight the importance of accounting for positive density dependence in the assessment of a population's scope for evolutionary rescue.","[{""name"":""Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h531d29"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGPIN–2021-03207;DGECR-2021-00114;""},{""name"":""Department of Science and Technology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0101xrq71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INSPIRE SHE;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Nonetheless, audiovisual temporal coherence can offer a complementary advantage in auditory selective attention tasks. We developed an audiovisual speech-in-noise test to assess the benefit of visually conveyed phonetic information and visual contributions to auditory streaming. The test was a video version of the Children's Coordinate Response Measure with a noun as the second keyword (vCCRMn). The vCCRMn allowed us to measure speech reception thresholds in the presence of two competing talkers under three visual conditions: a full naturalistic video (AV), a video which was interrupted during the target word presentation (Inter), thus, providing no lipreading cues, and a static image of a talker with audio only (A). In each case, the video/image could display either the target talker, or one of the two competing maskers. We assessed speech reception thresholds in each visual condition in 37 young ([&le;]35 years old) normal-hearing participants. Lipreading ability was independently assessed with the Test of Adult Speechreading (TAS). Results showed that both target-coherent AV and Inter visual conditions offer participants a listening benefit over the static image audio-only condition, with the full AV target-coherent condition providing the most benefit. Lipreading ability correlated with the audiovisual benefit shown in the full AV target-coherent condition, but not the benefit in the Inter target-coherent condition.

Theory predicts that increased genome size may confer an advantage in populations with small effective size. However, contradictory evidence for the correlation with environmental variation, and limited understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms, has cast doubts on the adaptive role of genome size variation. To address this, we studied two Hordeum species which were collected at the same sites along a wide range of environments but different in life habit (annual/perrenial) and mating strategy (self/out-crossing). We observed significant variation in genome size, with differences of up to 10% consistently detected in both species. Mating system influenced only the proportion of variation maintained within populations but not the overall range of genome size. In both species, drought emerged as the primary environmental factor associated with genome expansion, with transposable elements (TE) accumulation identified as the main driver of this expansion. Genome-wide association studies revealed that TE silencing is the key mechanism regulating genome size, and that selection favors smaller genomes among individuals growing at suitable habitats. Under increasingly stressful conditions, the regulation of TE activity fades, leading to TE accumulation and genome expansion, thereby increasing genetic variation available for selection. This integrative study provides a comprehensive view of how genome size is regulated in natural populations and highlights its exaptive role in inducing genetic variation under environmental stress.","[{""name"":""Israel Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""United State-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""German-Israeli Foundation (GIF)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""I-2501-204.12-2018;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Cell-based studies have contributed to a widely accepted model in which the import factor Importin 9 (IPO9) acts in concert with the actin filament-severing protein cofilin to transport actin into the nucleus. The classical nuclear localization signal on cofilin is thought to anchor IPO9 to cofilin-bound actin monomers, driving the formation of an import-competent tripartite actin*cofilin*IPO9 complex. In striking contradiction to this established model of actin import, we demonstrate that IPO9 directly binds to monomeric actin with mid-nanomolar affinity and, rather than promoting IPO9*actin complex formation, cofilin competitively inhibits binding of IPO9 to actin. We further report competitive binding for monomeric actin between IPO9 and the canonical actin monomer-sequestering protein, profilin. As cofilin and profilin are both capable of binding actin monomers at the barbed face, our results are consistent with a model in which IPO9 binds an overlapping portion of this interface. In further support, we demonstrate that IPO9 modestly occludes the barbed face of actin monomers, decreasing the rate of filament formation, and exhibits minimal filamentous actin binding. Finally, we identify unexpected affinity between the nuclear import release factor RanGTP and monomeric actin; however, a tripartite IPO9*actin*RanGTP complex does not form. The competitive interactions observed between IPO9 and cytoplasmic actin-binding proteins suggest dynamically coupled equilibria mediate the nuclear transport of actin monomers.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35- GM145373;""},{""name"":""Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/052nngb38"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CRF Fletcher Scholar;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation. These findings establish ORF7a as a key modulator of host metabolic reprogramming and highlight mitochondrial pathways as potential therapeutic targets in COVID-19.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Aged lysosomes in brain, heart, muscle and adipose accumulate glycerophosphodiesters and cystine, metabolites that are causally linked to juvenile lysosomal storage disorders like Batten disease. Levels of these metabolites increase linearly with age, preceding organismal decline. Caloric restriction, a lifespan-extending intervention, mitigates these changes in the heart but not the brain.

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

The mechanisms that facilitate immunostimulatory ligand release from microbes during infection are largely undefined. Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS. WTA therefore operates as a meta-regulator of inflammation, by controlling the availability of microbial ligands that stimulate innate immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI167993;R37AI116550;T32AI7061;K08AI193234;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-123-24;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DK34854;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

In most aerobic photosynthetic organisms such as {beta}-cyanobacteria and all plants, the key CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco strictly relies on dedicated chaperones for its assembly. Why these chaperones were recruited is unclear, as they are absent and not required in other prokaryotic autotrophs. By retracing the evolution of Rubisco-chaperone interactions, we find that Rubiscos dependence on chaperones evolved neutrally and not by adaptive optimization, and that this may be reversed without compromising catalytic function. Our work shows how chaperones are broad modifiers of their clients sequence spaces that can become totally essential through non-adaptive processes.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101040472;""},{""name"":""Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05r7n9c40"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Philipps University of Marburg"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01rdrb571"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 684-2022;""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska&#8209;Curie Actions"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101106795;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337803

Species frequency varied with geography and substrate, but the majority of species commonly present in vineyards were also found in non-vineyard arboreal environments, representing a potential source for vineyard colonization and exploitation of sugar from grapes. Species varied in both copper and sulfite resistance, but only Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed elevated resistance in vineyard compared to non-vineyard samples.

While this crisis has been widely discussed in other fields, its impact on physical therapy research has received little attention.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to provide an overview of the current state of physical therapy research practices that could suggest low replicability.

MethodsWe assessed the research practices in all original research articles published in official journals of national physical therapy associations in the USA (Physical Therapy), Canada (Physiotherapy Canada), the UK (Physiotherapy), and Australia (Journal of Physiotherapy) between 2022 and 2024.

ResultsA total of 465 original research articles were identified. Of these, 28% were preregistered, 0% were replication studies or registered reports, and 12% provided open data. Sample size justification was reported in 37% of quantitative studies and 23% of qualitative studies. Despite an average time from submission to publication of 400 days, only 1% of manuscripts were preprinted. Among quantitative studies, 33% stated a hypothesis, while 63% relied on significance testing. Of the reported significant p-values, 39% fell within the fragile range (.01[&le;] p<.05), substantially exceeding the expected 26% under 80% power and suggesting questionable research practices. Hypotheses were supported in 83% of cases, indicating an unreasonably high rate of positive results. A marked difference in the number of p-values just above and just below the significance threshold suggested publication bias.

ConclusionThese results suggest shortcomings in the reproducibility, replicability, and transparency of the physical therapy literature. Addressing these issues requires the adoption of best practices, including registered reports, justifying sample sizes, publishing negative results, and sharing data and code. Delays in implementing these practices risk exacerbating bias in the literature and undermining the scientific credibility of physical therapy research.

We present Spacelink, a unified framework that models spatial variability of a gene at both whole-tissue and cell-type resolution using an adaptive mixture of data-driven spatial kernels and summarizes it using an Effective Spatial Variability (ESV) metric. Spacelink achieved up to 3.2x higher detection power over eight existing global SVG and cell-type SVG methods while showing consistently superior FDR control across 34 different simulation settings and also showed superior cross-platform concordance in matched tissue Visium and CosMx datasets. Applied to 3 healthy CosMx human tissues (brain cortex, lymph node, liver), Spacelink revealed that SVGs are highly informative for 113 complex traits and diseases (average N = 340,406). Spacelink showed up to 2.2x higher disease informativeness over competing methods in tissue-relevant complex diseases and traits, conditional on putative non-spatial expression-level confounders. Applied to a mouse organogenesis Stereo-seq atlas (8 developmental stages), Spacelink identified 145 genes with stage-associated ESV within brain independent of mean expression, that are enriched in pathways like Wnt signaling and Rap1 signaling characterizing early and late development, respectively. Integration with in vivo Perturb-seq targeting 35 de novo ASD risk genes revealed that perturbations in excitatory neurons and astrocytes preferentially altered spatially structured downstream gene programs (1.7-2.2x higher average ESV across stages than other cell types), many of which were enriched for polygenic autism GWAS loci. In neurodegeneration, analysis of 32 Visium dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology stages identified 334 genes with decreasing ESV along amyloid burden (enriched for glycolysis) and 216 genes with decreasing ESV along tau tangle accumulation (enriched for apoptotic pathways). Several AD risk genes (PKM, CLU, GPI) showed conserved reductions in spatial variability with AD pathology in both human and 5xFAD mouse, with PKM linking to a colocalized splicing QTL and amyloid burden QTL variant. These results highlight the utility of Spacelink in decoding spatially variable gene programs that connect tissue architecture to disease genetics.","[{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R00HG012203;R01HG014008;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30CA008748;""},{""name"":""Amazon (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04mv4n011"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02yrq0923"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ADSF-21-816675;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30AG10161;P30AG72975;""},{""name"":""National Institute on Aging"",""id"":""https://ror.org/049v75w11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AG17917;R01AG015819;U01AG072572;U01AG046152;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development. These insights may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for anemia.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 CA015910;RO1 CA025560;R01 CA001120;R01 CA148828;R01 CA245546;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DK095201;U2C DK129445;""},{""name"":""National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Intramural Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/023ny1p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL148333;R01 HL157062;F31 HL172674-02.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

The ability to access brain signals reliably and continuously over many years post-implantation is crucial for iBCIs to be effective and feasible. This study investigates the signal characteristics and long-term stability of neural activity recorded with a stent-electrode array over 1 year post-implant.

MethodsWe report on five participants with paralysis who were enrolled in an early feasibility clinical trial of an endovascular iBCI (Stentrode; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05035823). Each participant was implanted with a 16-channel stent-electrode array, deployed in the superior sagittal sinus to record bilaterally from the primary motor cortices. Neural activity was recorded during home-based sessions while the participants performed a set of standardized tasks. Metrics including motor signal strength during attempted movement, resting state signal features, and electrode impedances were quantified over time.

ResultsMotor-related modulation in neural activity was exhibited in the high-frequency bands (30-200 Hz) during attempted movements, with rest and attempted movement states showing sustained differentiation over time. Impedance and resting state band power for most channels did not change significantly over time.

ConclusionsThese findings provide strong evidence that the endovascular BCIs may be suitable for long-term neural signal acquisition in the home environment, demonstrating the ability to record movement-related modulation over one year.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759097337804

Previous simulation studies have shown that early treatment initiation is critical to maximize the therapeutic response in antiviral treatment in an acute viral infection such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. A recent experimental study demonstrated that late therapy initiation can lead to diminished antiviral potency. However, most VD model simulations with varying treatment initiation time accounted only for the effect of initiation condition (i.e., state of different cell populations when the therapy started), the loss of drug potency has been under-investigated. This may overestimate the antiviral effect, potentially resulting in suboptimal dose selection. To this end, we aimed to characterize relationship between the drug potency (EC50) and the timing of drug addition, using nirmatrelvir and GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Viral load data were obtained from in vitro experiments with various drug concentrations and treatment initiated between 0 to 3 days post infection. EC50 values were fitted for each treatment initiation group and were found to vary with the timing of treatment initiation in both drugs. Also, a VD model with time-varying EC50 provided better fits than a constant EC50 model (BIC = 1667.90 vs. 1677.84). Further simulations also indicated that a constant EC50 model overestimated the antiviral efficacy when treatment started late. These findings highlighted the importance of considering EC50 shift when optimizing dosage regimens for patients presenting late.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

Social information transmission has been observed amongst individuals in fish schools, bird flocks, and human groups, but the neural mechanisms for detecting socially transmitted information are poorly understood. By studying the schooling glassfish Danionella cerebrum, here we demonstrate that escape from danger is enhanced by visual perception of other escaping fish. We found that neural populations in the midbrain optic tectum and dorsal thalamus are activated by the rapid escape of social partners. These neurons are also driven by the sudden disappearance of virtual social partners, yet unaffected by disappearing stimuli without social relevance. Virtual fish schools that escape or disappear were sufficient to cause observers to escape, even in the absence of direct threats. These results demonstrate that rapid social-off detection in visual circuits enables the detection of socially transmitted threat information, which may be a particularly effective strategy for animals capable of rapid movement but limited visual range. These results show how neural computations in individuals enables rapid information sharing in animal collectives.","[{""name"":""UC San Diego J.

Indeed, in sensory-cognitive experiments participants tend to align their respiration to the upcoming expected trials and their respiratory phase relates to neurophysiological processes reflecting changes in neural excitation, attention or arousal. However, it remains unclear whether this alignment is a passive entrainment to a task's overall rhythm or an active process selectively aligning respiration based on the demands of individual events. We here tested this by recording respiration during three visual discrimination experiments that manipulated trial importance by either imposing different response deadlines or by manipulating trial value and difficulty. Our results show that participants align their respiration more consistently around stimulus onset for trials with short deadlines or trials presenting high-value and high-difficulty. These findings demonstrate that respiratory alignment is dynamically modulated on a trial-by-trial basis according to the anticipated required effort or task demands. Hence we conclude that respiration serves as an active tool to strategically allocate cognitive resources for sensory-motor challenges.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

To gain further insight into the events that drive longitudinal growth, we combined BONCAT-based labeling of newly synthesized proteins with high-resolution imaging and determined that the in-series addition of sarcomeres is mediated by a process that involves transverse splitting at the Z-lines of pre-existing sarcomeres. Collectively, our findings not only challenge the long-standing view that mechanically induced growth is uniformly governed by mTORC1, but they also lay the framework for a new understanding of the molecular and structural events that drive this process.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid.

Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of collinear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

We tested the hypothesis that area V4 contains signals that could support recognition memory. Our task increased difficulty, allowing comparisons of neuronal population responses on correct and error trials. We observed signatures of several proposed memory mechanisms including magnitude coding, repetition suppression, sparse coding, and population response consistency, but only sparse coding and population response consistency predicted behavior. Familiar images also evoked faster dynamics, consistent with pattern completion. These findings demonstrate that the building blocks of fast, high-capacity memory are present in mid-level sensory cortex, highlighting its role in distributed memory networks.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Drug Abuse"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fq5cm18"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5T90DA059109-03;""},{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY034723;R01EY022930;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1NS121913;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""542961SPI;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word ""hand"" still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

Sideways locomotion is a defining feature of true crabs (Brachyura) and may have contributed to their ecological success. Yet, the evolutionary origin of this unique behavior remains unknown. Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.","[{""name"":""Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from The Japan Science Society"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-4086;2025-4060;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

However, the conditions and mechanisms that lead to the robust induction of respiratory IgA responses following mucosal vaccination remain poorly understood. It is also currently debatable whether mucosal vaccination is still warranted given that most individuals in developed countries have established a hybrid immunity from vaccination and infection. Here we characterized respiratory mucosal immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination or both in humans. We found that hybrid immunity resulted in moderately increased respiratory IgA and neutralizing antibody responses compared to infection or vaccination alone. However, a direct comparison of hybrid immunity and a mucosal adenovirus-based booster vaccination in animal models revealed that respiratory booster immunization elicited markedly stronger and more durable respiratory IgA, T cell response, and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, supporting the promise of respiratory mucosal vaccination. Mechanistically, we found that mucosal booster immunization induced local IgA- secreting cells in the respiratory mucosa, aided by pulmonary CD4+ T cells in situ. Strikingly, local IL-21-producing Blimp-1+ Th1 effector cells were critical in mediating the CD4+ T cell help for respiratory IgA production. Furthermore, lung macrophages were important for this respiratory IgA response via the production of TGF-{beta}.

Collectively, our results uncover a local cellular network supporting enhanced respiratory IgA responses, with implications for the development of optimal mucosal immunization strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens.","[{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

To investigate how task similarity and training regime interact during learning, we trained participants on spatial and conceptual learning tasks that shared either similar or distinct underlying structures, using either interleaved or blocked regimes. Interleaving the two tasks hindered performance when their structures were similar, compared to when they were different. In contrast, blocked training produced the opposite effect: it improved performance and facilitated transfer across similar tasks. This effect, however, emerged only when participants first learned the conceptual task, followed by the spatial task, suggesting an asymmetric interaction between task order and structural similarity. We also replicated our results using a neural network model, providing converging evidence for the computational principles governing the interplay between training regime and structural similarity in multi-task learning.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-CoG GEOCOG 724836;""},{""name"":""Kavli Institute"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262/F50;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

Human participants learned sequences of environments in immersive virtual reality. They then learned novel environment transitions connecting previously separate sequences. During subsequent fMRI, participants predicted multiple steps into the future in both the newly connected sequence and control sequences that remained separate. The hippocampus integrated representations of the connected sequence, such that activity patterns became more similar across trials for the connected sequence vs. the unconnected sequences. These integrated sequence representations in the hippocampus emerged soon after learning, incorporated representations of the initial sequences as well as new activity patterns not previously present in either sequence, and predicted participants ability to update their predictions in behavior. Together, these results advance our understanding of how structured knowledge dynamically emerges in service of adaptive behavior.","[{""name"":""National Eye Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wkg3b53"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01EY034436;Zuckerman Institute Seed Grant for MR Studies;CU-ZI-MR-S-0016;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759097337804

We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

This study identified more than 421 million single-nucleotide variants and indels and more than 600 million copy-number and structural variants. Small variants had 756 million molecular effects annotated. Of 7.7 million polymorphic variants having an allele frequency (AF) of more than 5% in EGP, 1,348 have a predicted deleterious effect on a protein. Characterization with respect to global variation shows that EGP represents a genetic continuum encompassing the range of African, Asian, and European populations. It is best described by two Arabian, an Eurasian, and an African component, with the predominant Arabian component linked to mitochondrial haplogroups J and T that are commonly attributed to the Middle East. Various aneuploidies of sex chromosomes were detected in 93 individuals overall, and aneuploidy of chromosome 21 was identified in 41 individuals. Median inbreeding coefficient and cumulative runs of homozygosity (ROHs) lengths were increased due to extensive consanguinity, were largest in the groups with Arabian main ancestry components, and were higher than reported for Qatar. Families were identified based on genetic relatedness and classified into 264 families with unrelated parents and 247 families with third- and fourth-degree consanguineous parents. Representative consanguineous pedigrees of families in EGP were outlined. Cumulative ROHs were affected by the main ancestry component and significantly increased in offspring of consanguineous parents, with a pronounced difference between 3rd and 4th-degree relatedness. Investigation of cumulative AFs of variants causing Mendelian diseases highlighted genes related to alpha- and beta-thalassemia (HBB, HBA2) and showed a high burden of variants causing severe recessive diseases, metabolic and retinal disorders, and hearing loss. In summary, EGP represents a landmark effort in characterizing the genetic diversity of the Emirati population, leveraging the largest Middle Eastern cohort reported to date.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759097337804
