XPro1595 selectively neutralizes pathological soluble TNF while preserving neuroprotective transmembrane TNF signaling, offering a mechanistically distinct approach from current amyloid-targeting therapies.

MethodsThe MINDFuL trial was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted across 35 centers in eight countries. Participants aged 50-85 years with Early AD (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia) and elevated inflammatory biomarkers received weekly subcutaneous injections of XPro1595 (1.0 mg/kg) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the Early Mild Alzheimers Cognitive Composite (EMACC). A prospectively defined biomarker-enriched population included amyloid-positive participants with a high inflammatory burden (ADi), defined by the presence of [&ge;]2 inflammatory markers.

ResultsOf 206 randomized participants, 200 comprised the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and 100 comprised the ADi population. In the mITT analysis, no significant difference was observed in the EMACC (p=0.672). However, the ADi population showed promising signals across multiple clinical endpoints favoring XPro1595, including the EMACC (Cohens d = 0.27), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, d = 0.23), particularly the subfactor agitation/hyperactivity (d = 0.37), and a patient-reported outcome: Goal Attainment Scale (GAS, d = 0.18). These results were consistent with biomarker changes that favored XPro1595, as plasma pTau217 (d = -0.18) and GFAP (d = -0.19) were attenuated in the ADi population. In addition, many effect sizes were larger when assessing participants with higher drug exposure. Notably, no amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) were observed, even though [~]70% of the participants were APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers, and one-third had baseline microbleeds.

ConclusionsWhile XPro1595 did not meet the primary endpoint in the overall population, participants with biologically-defined AD and high inflammatory burden demonstrated consistent trends toward cognitive benefit and neuropsychiatric improvement. The complete absence of ARIA distinguishes XPro1595 from amyloid-targeting therapies and supports its potential for use in combination strategies and potentially for those at a higher risk of ARIA. These findings support selective TNF inhibition as a promising therapeutic approach for persons with AD and elevated inflammatory burden.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1759270142273

While open models for unconstrained ""minibinder"" design have shown great experimental promise, methods for designing binders in specific formats, such as antibodies, have lagged behind in experimental success rates. In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information. Using mBER, we designed two libraries comprising over 1 million VHH binders against 436 diverse targets. We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%. Through mBER, we demonstrate that format-specific binder design is possible with no additional training of underlying folding and language models. This work represents the largest reported de novo protein design and validation campaign, and one of the first open-source methods to demonstrate double-digit percentage experimental success rates for antibody binder design.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Today, images of biological structures can be acquired using different imaging technologies and at increasing resolutions. However, identifying relevant structural features in three-dimensional (3D) images remains a significant challenge. 3D image segmentation is usually performed using deep-learning segmentation models. Such models are trained on manually annotated and segmented, dataset-specific images. Consequently, they rarely generalize across datasets. Here, we overcome these limitations with TopoTome, an unsupervised 3D image segmentation and analysis algorithm. TopoTome is based on topological data analysis, and conceptually distinct from standard clustering and deep learning image analysis models. It encodes the 3D image directly in topological space. Then, it performs unsupervised clustering to detect and segment features represented by salient and spatially coherent voxel intensity gradients. We demonstrate on simple, complex, synthetic and real-world 3D image data that it outperforms all 3D clustering algorithms. Its segmentation ranks with or outperforms best-in-class deep learning 3D image segmentation software. Beyond image segmentation, it provides streamlined topological data analysis of 3D images, advancing 3D image analysis from conventional mesh volumetry to structural topology. Owing to its conceptually different topological data analysis core, TopoTome does not need prior information and tuning to generalize across different imaging modalities, including fluorescence microscopy and X-ray computed tomography. We show it also readily generalizes across biological subjects, such as different species, organs and cells. TopoTome is thus one of the most versatile and accurate unsupervised 3D image segmentation algorithms.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

However, due to the challenges of differentiating goat remains from that of sheep using traditional archaeozoological approaches, there are few specimens specifically identified as goat. To address this we employed genetic, proteomics, and archaeozoological techniques to assess faunal remains from the Late Bronze assemblage of Haughey's Fort (Armagh) and medieval assemblage of Carrickfergus (Antrim). We identify these specimens as goats using proteomics and genetics, and additionally determine their molecular sex. Genomic data recovered from a Haughey's Fort goat reveals a three-millenia genetic connection between herds in the Late Bronze Age, medieval period, and the indigenous Irish breed extant today, the Old Irish Goat. We additionally find varying levels of inbreeding within goats from the settlement of Carrickfergus, suggesting possible mixed use of herds within medieval Irish society. Our results demonstrate the continuing potential of combining archaeological and biomolecular techniques to clarify existing ambiguities and at the same time reveal new facets of the past.","[{""name"":""EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/K039660/1; EP/M028127/1;""},{""name"":""Northern Way Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""885729-AncestralWeave;101055195-ANSOC;""},{""name"":""Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""21/PATH-S/9515(T);GOIPG/2023/4390;""},{""name"":""AHRC Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Using beCasKAS in primary human T-cells, we observe that mRNA-encoded ABE8e and PAMless ABE8e-SpRY base editors have distinct off-target profiles that can be mitigated by optimizing mRNA dose.

Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at [~]10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.

Significance StatementThis study tested resonance properties of the infant visual system upon perturbation. For the visual stimulation at discrete frequencies between 2 and 30Hz, the infant brain responded at 4Hz independent of the stimulation frequency. Following broadband stimulation, a perceptual echo at 4Hz emerged - resonating the 4Hz component of visual information over several cycles. These findings reveal that the 4Hz theta rhythm is an inherent processing dynamic of the infant visual system, contrasting with the 10Hz rhythm found in adults. The processing dynamics of the human visual system undergo fundamental changes from infancy into adulthood.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""KO 6028/1-1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Objective: To deeply characterize FF-fibroblasts and identify programs governing their differentiation and activation. Methods: GeoMx spatial transcriptomics was applied to IPF lung regions, comparing carefully delineated FF (excluding overlying epithelium) with areas of established fibrosis, to derive an FF-specific signature. This signature was projected onto a large single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset to identify an FF-specific fibroblast cluster, facilitating its deep characterization. Measurements and Main Results: GeoMx revealed 272 increased genes in FF; this FF-signature was validated against several independent spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. FF-signature genes were highly enriched in a specific cluster of fibroblasts in the IPF scRNA-seq dataset. MMP11 was the most specific gene of the FF-fibroblast cluster, and was validated using in situ RNA hybridization. Furthermore, higher MMP11 bronchoalveolar lavage protein levels were found in progressive pulmonary fibrosis and were associated with worse outcome in Cox regression (HR 4.54, 95% CI 1.24-15.8). Cell-cell interaction analysis with fibroblasts and adjacent aberrant basaloid cells, detected signals that may induce the FF-fibroblast signature, including from TGF-{beta} superfamily ligands. Using trajectory and transcription factor (TF) analysis we show that the trajectory from non-FF to FF-specific fibroblasts is correlated with activation of EMT-associated TFs and deactivation of AP-1 family TFs. Conclusions: We identified transcriptional programs governing FF-fibroblasts, for which MMP11 serves as a novel highly-specific biomarker with prognostic significance. We highlight potential regulators whose targeting may curb pulmonary fibrosis progression.","[{""name"":""Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Association of Friends"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Here, we employ a suite of tools for rapid lysosomal isolation to construct a multi-tissue atlas of the metabolite changes that murine lysosomes undergo during aging. Aged lysosomes in brain, heart, muscle and adipose accumulate glycerophosphodiesters and cystine, metabolites that are causally linked to juvenile lysosomal storage disorders like Batten disease. Levels of these metabolites increase linearly with age, preceding organismal decline. Caloric restriction, a lifespan-extending intervention, mitigates these changes in the heart but not the brain. Our findings link lysosomal storage disorders to aging-related dysfunction, uncover a metabolic lysosomal ""aging clock,"" and open avenues for the mechanistic investigation of how lysosomal functions deteriorate during aging and in age-associated diseases.

While motors and lysosomal surface adaptors driving this movement are well studied, how the microtubule cytoskeleton specifies lysosomal transport and its coupling to mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling remains unclear. Here, we show that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide nutrient-responsive lysosome positioning. Using super-resolution imaging and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that lysosomes carrying active mTORC1 preferentially traffic along tyrosinated microtubules to reach the cell periphery, whereas detyrosinated microtubules restrict their motility. Nutrient stimulation enhances this outward transport, while concurrently suppressing microtubule detyrosination through mTORC1-S6K1 signaling, likely via inhibition of vasohibin activity. This ensures selective expansion of tyrosinated microtubule tracks to sustain mTORC1 signaling. Strikingly, in cancer cells where aberrant mTORC1 activity correlates with altered microtubule tyrosination, restoring microtubule detyrosination rescues mTORC1 hyperactivation and suppresses cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Thus, demonstrating that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide the positioning of nutrient-responsive lysosomes. These findings uncover a crosstalk between mTORC1 and tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination status that couples nutrient availability to lysosomal dynamics and identify microtubule tyrosination as a regulatory node with therapeutic potential in cancer.","[{""name"":""Anusandhan National Research foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANRF CRG/2022/008391;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Historically, studies have focused on vesicle exo- and endocytosis and their release machinery at synapses, and much less is known about non-synaptic exocytosis. If and how vesicles can access the plasma membrane along the axonal shaft, overcoming the insulating layer of the membrane-associated periodic scaffold, remains unclear. Here, we used fast live-cell imaging of mature cultured hippocampal neurons expressing the vamp2-pHluorin reporter to map sponta-neous exocytosis along axons. We detected non-synaptic exocytic events along the axon shaft that concentrated at the axon initial segment. Perturbation of the membrane-associated actin-spectrin skeleton revealed its role in regulating shaft exocytosis, similarly to its recently demonstrated role in shaping axonal endocytosis. To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits. Overall, our work reveals a new process of spontaneous exocytosis along the axon shaft, and how the axonal submem-brane skeleton shapes a heterogeneous landscape that uniquely segregates vesicular trafficking events.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-20-CE13-0024;ANR-21-CE42-0015;ANR-20-CE16-0021;""},{""name"":""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EQ202103012966;""},{""name"":""Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AOE 16 “Espoir en tête” 2021;""},{""name"":""CPER-FEDER"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PA0014842;""},{""name"":""AMIDEX"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AMX-19-IET-002;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101001332;""},{""name"":""European Innovation Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05cx8cy07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pathfinder Open;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EMBO-2020-IG-4734;""},{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EOSS6-0000000260;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

In Arabidopsis thaliana, PLANT PEPTIDE CONTAINING SULFATED TYROSINE (PSY) peptides and their receptors (PSYRs) mediate growth-stress trade-offs, yet the transcriptional regulation of these genes remains poorly understood. Here, we mapped transcription factor (TF)-promoter interactions for nine PSY and three PSYR genes by combining high-throughput yeast one-hybrid screening with DAP-seq data, uncovering 1,207 interactions that reveal both shared and gene-specific regulatory relationships. Functional analysis of 25 TF mutants identified 12 regulators that significantly influence shoot and root growth, most acting as repressors. Of these, CYTOKININ RESPONSE FACTOR 10 (CRF10) emerged as a strong growth inhibitor. We found a CRF10 binding motif in the PSYR3 promoter using DAP-seq data and validated by eY1H. Guided by these insights, we applied CRISPR/Cas9-mediated promoter editing to precisely delete functional TF-binding sites. Removal of this motif, or its surrounding region, reduced PSYR3 expression and enhanced root growth, yielding variants that retained root length comparable to the crf10 mutant but displayed reduced susceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. Together, our results define the global TF-promoter interaction network of the PSYR/PSY pathway and identify CRF10 as a key transcriptional regulator of PSYR3-mediated signaling. More broadly, our work demonstrates that cis-regulatory editing can systematically fine-tune gene expression, generate predictable growth traits, and provide a TFBS-targeted framework for engineering plant growth-defense balance.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH MIRA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""#R35 GM148173;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

How do memories that are seemingly inaccessible persistently influence cognitive processes and behaviors throughout life? Rodent studies have demonstrated that forgotten infantile memories remain encoded as latent ""infantile memory engrams"" (iEngrams) within neuronal circuits, capable of memory reinstatement under artificial experimental conditions. Still, the network mechanisms underpinning the natural reinstatement of a forgotten infantile memory are unknown. Here, we show that infantile memories, though physiologically irretrievable in adults, remain stored within hippocampal circuits and their engrams contribute to hippocampal network dynamics. Crucially, reinstating these memories requires a carefully orchestrated network process. An initial contextual reminder primes the hippocampal network to increase activity of the iEngram during a subsequent aversive reminder, which tags iEngram neurons for offline reactivation. This reactivation facilitates the integration of previously latent infantile memories with novel neuronal ensembles, reinstating behavior consistent with the original memory. These findings critically advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying physiological memory encoding, retrieval, and reinstatement across development. Furthermore, they delineate the temporal boundaries and underlying physiological substrate of the process by which a latent representation becomes associated with a novel neuronal substrate, suggesting potential interventions to prevent the maladaptive reinstatement of traumatic infantile memories.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ERC-ST2019 850769;""},{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CEGP3_194220;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Database mining uncovered endogenous viral elements in a broad spectrum of eukaryotes, spanning algae, fungi, and parasitic protists highlighting that giant virus integration is both widespread and evolutionarily persistent. Orthologous clustering of 2.5 million proteins identified 135,998 orthogroups representing comprehensive metabolic capabilities, such as enrichment of genes involved in aromatic compound degradation (commonly associated with bioremediation) in Algavirales genomes.

We recorded neural populations from three areas of the primate frontal cortex involved in decision making to characterize neural dynamics while animals performed a standard RL task. By combining behavioral and neuron population analysis, we found a neural subspace in midcingulate (MCC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) that precisely tracked value computations.

Understanding the mechanism behind OMV biogenesis in Bacteroides spp. is necessary to determine their role in the gut. Recent studies showed that mutation of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 1 increased OMV production in Bacteroides thetaeotaomicron (Bt) by regulating members of its downstream regulon. Additional members of the Dma family have been identified, but very little is known regarding their roles in Bt. Here, we investigate the role of Dual Membrane-spanning Anti-sigma factor 2 (Dma2) in controlling OMV biogenesis in Bt. We employ biochemical and proteomic analyses to show that mutation of dma2 increases OMV production in a manner that is dependent on the expression of its cognate sigma factor, das2. The precise mechanism by which dma2 increases OMV biogenesis remains elusive. However, transcriptome analyses revealed that {Delta}dma2 has decreased expression of select polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that primarily target host-associated glycans. Follow-up comparative proteomics showed that the PUL repertoire was most impacted in the OMV fraction. In vitro growth assessments showed that {Delta}dma2 exhibits delayed growth in the presence of select host-associated glycans. Colonization studies in mice revealed that {Delta}dma2 is outcompeted by the wild-type in the gut, which indicates that dma2 is a key determinant of colonization fitness in Bt. Altogether, these findings expand our knowledge of the Dma familys role in OMV biogenesis and demonstrates their importance in Bacteroides physiology.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

However, we know that environmental cues can also regulate AgRP neurons, since cues that predict future food intake rapidly inhibit AgRP neurons. But is the converse true: can the prediction of future fasting rapidly activate AgRP neurons? Here we show that such rapid fasting activation of AgRP neurons does occur. This fasting response is driven by excitatory input from paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing Sim2, which are bidirectionally sensitive to predictions of future energy state. In this way, cognitively-processed contextual information conveyed by PVH-Sim2 neurons strongly activates AgRP neurons. Lastly, chronic silencing of PVH-Sim2 neurons causes persistent hypophagia. This PVH-Sim2 to AgRP neuron circuit, by anticipating and preventing negative energy balance, provides an important new dimension of hunger regulation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Carnosine dipeptidase II (CNDP2) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that hydrolyzes Cys-Gly and plays an important role in maintaining intracellular cysteine (Cys) homeostasis. CNDP2-mediated hydrolysis of Cys-Gly promotes Cys mobilization and contributes to the replenishment of intracellular GSH levels. CNDP2 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers and has been implicated in tumor cell proliferation and progression. This mechanism may enhance cancer cell survival by causing resistance to oxidative stress, which indicates that CNDP2 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.

Although bestatin (BES) has been identified as a CNDP2 inhibitor, its limited specificity and suboptimal drug-like properties have limited its therapeutic potential. In this study, we performed an in silico screen of a small-molecule compound library and identified KKL-35 as a novel CNDP2-binding molecule. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that KKL-35 interacts within the catalytic pocket. Biochemical assays confirmed that it inhibits CNDP2 enzymatic activity, albeit with lower potency compared with BES. Despite its modest intrinsic activity, KKL-35 exhibits favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, which are characterized by a low topological polar surface area (TPSA), reduced molecular flexibility, and well-balanced lipophilicity. This positions it as an attractive and tractable starting point for lead optimization. Taken together, these findings establish KKL-35 as a validated CNDP2 inhibitor and a promising lead compound for the development of more selective therapeutics targeting CNDP2-mediated cancer cell metabolism.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Results: snRNA-seq revealed distinct AMPK isoform distribution: {gamma}1 was ubiquitously expressed, whereas {gamma}3 was enriched in glycolytic myofibers in both mouse and human skeletal muscle. Ex vivo, glucose uptake stimulated by either AICAR or MK-8722 was abolished in im{gamma}1-/-/{gamma}3-/- muscle, and MK-8722-induced blood glucose lowering was significantly blunted in vivo. AICAR but not MK-8722-stimulated muscle glucose uptake was abolished in im{gamma}3-/-, whereas both activators fully retained effects on glucose uptake and glucose lowering in im{gamma}1-/- mice. Conclusions: While {gamma}1 predominates in stabilizing the AMPK2{beta}2{gamma}1 complex, it is dispensable for AMPK activator-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, whether mediated via the nucleotide-binding or ADaM site.","[{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF21OC0070257;NNF23SA0084103;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Retinoids have been reported to exhibit antiviral potentials against multiple viral infections. In the present study, Tretinoin (TR) or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was evaluated for its anti-CHIKV activity using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models. TR was able to impede CHIKV infection efficiently in Vero and physiologically relevant muscle cells, C2C12, with drastic reduction in the viral RNA, proteins and progeny formation. The IC50 of TR against CHIKV was estimated to be 20.05 {micro}M and 19.71 {micro}M in Vero and C2C12 cells, respectively. In addition, the inhibition was effective during entry as well as in the early stages of post CHIKV-infection. Notably, TR showed remarkable virucidal activity. Next, global transcriptome profile demonstrated that the signaling by Retinoic acid pathway was highly upregulated after CHIKV infection and Retinoic acid receptors (RAR), specifically RAR-{beta} are the key mediators for the anti-CHIKV effect of TR. Further, the drug was also capable to modulate CHIKV-induced inflammatory responses by reducing the phosphorylated MAPKs, NF-{kappa}B and proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, TR protected C57BL/6 mice from CHIKV challenge by diminishing viral burden leading to reduced clinical scores and better survival. Similar observation was also noticed in the ex vivo model of CHIKV-infected hPBMC-derived monocyte-macrophage populations. In conclusion, this work demonstrated the repurposing potential of TR against CHIKV infection for the first time, encouraging its clinical validation towards future therapeutics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Structural analyses reveal that constitutive Leucine Rich Repeat-Malectin interactions preconfigure IGP1 for ligand recognition and that the receptor features a highly specific sugar-binding pocket in the LRR domain capable of distinguishing fine variations in glycan structures.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a unifying theoretical framework, most empirical studies of animal learning behavior have focused on non-stationary environments (e.g. changing reward probabilities in a known task), as opposed to acquiring an entirely new task from scratch. Here we introduce a statistical framework to infer reinforcement learning rules directly from single-animal behavior. Applied to mice learning a perceptual decision-making task, our approach reveals that policy-gradient-like rules capture de novo task learning better than classical temporal-difference algorithms. By fitting flexible parametric learning rules, we uncover systematic deviations from standard RL models, including side-specific learning rates and negative reward baselines. Together, these parameters account for side-biased learning, as well as forgetting and consecutive errors due to aversive responses to incorrect trials. Extending the framework with latent, dynamic learning rates further reveals that animals adapt their learning rates over training and across curricula. These results provide a statistical account of how animals learn from scratch and highlight key departures from classical reinforcement learning algorithms.","[{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SCGB AWD543027;""},{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""9R01DA056404-04;1R01EY033064;U19NS104648;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Camera trapping has become an indispensable tool in wildlife ecology, generating vast datasets that require efficient and robust analytical workflows. The R package camtrapR was originally developed for preparing and managing camera trap data for subsequent analysis in external modeling packages like unmarked. It has since become a standard tool in the field for this purpose. 2. Here, we introduce a major update that transforms camtrapR from a data preparation tool into a comprehensive, end-to-end analytical platform. The centerpiece of this evolution is the surveyDashboard(), a novel code-free graphical user interface that guides users through the entire analysis pipeline, from data import to final predictions. This update also incorporates enhanced data import functionalities for major standards like Wildlife Insights and Camtrap DP, a complete workflow for fitting community occupancy models, and streamlined tools for environmental covariate extraction. 3. The interactive dashboard provides an integrated environment for the entire analytical process. Users can perform essential exploratory analyses, such as generating species accumulation curves and mapping species detections, before proceeding to model fitting. The interface supports the interactive construction of both single-species and multi-species (community) occupancy models. The dashboard's covariate preparation tools generate inputs for both model fitting and for creating spatial predictions of species occupancy. 4. Furthermore, the update introduces a comprehensive workflow for fitting Bayesian community occupancy models using JAGS or NIMBLE. This allows for hierarchical modeling of species- and community-level responses to environmental drivers, providing deeper insights into wildlife communities. The workflow includes tools for model assessment, such as convergence diagnostics and posterior predictive checks for goodness-of-fit. 5. By integrating a powerful, code-free interface with advanced backend modeling functions, this major update to camtrapR aims to make robust and reproducible camera trap data analysis accessible to a wider audience, including ecologists, wildlife managers, and students. This paper serves as the new definitive reference for the expanded functionality of camtrapR as a comprehensive tool for modern camera trap studies.","[{""name"":""United States Agency for International Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01n6e6j62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""7204402CA00001;""},{""name"":""Bundesministerium für Forschung, Technologie und Raumfahrt"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""16LW0439;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

The thermodynamic details of the underlying process have been previously examined, but the mechanistic details remain largely underexplored owing in part, to a lack of suitable technologies capable of assessing nanoscopic membrane disruption events. Key open questions include: how do detergents remodel the membrane structure at sub-solubilizing concentrations? And what is the sequence of morphological transitions that lead up to solubilization? Here, we introduce a single-colour assay based on the fluorescence de-quenching of membrane-integrated fluorophores as a sensitive and generalizable tool to probe nanoscale membrane remodelling events induced by detergents. We demonstrate, using fluorescence spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting, that the widely used detergent Triton X-100 triggers substantial morphological changes at concentrations below its critical micellar concentration. Moreover, by taking advantage of single vesicle fluorescence lifetime imaging and scanning electron microscopy, we reveal that the swelling step involves a morphological transition from spherical vesicles to toroidal structures, providing direct evidence for detergent-driven membrane reorganization prior to solubilization. Our findings support and refine a multistep model of detergent-induced membrane solubilization, positioning fluorescence de-quenching as a tool for detecting conformational intermediates. We show that the fluorescence de-quenching approach performs robustly across multiple cyanine-based probes and experimental conditions and its nanoscale sensitivity provides a platform from which to interrogate membrane perturbations induced by a wide variety of molecular disruptors, including those with important biomedical significance.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/V034030/1;EP/V047663/1;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer’s Research UK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF2019-A-001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Using bispecific antibodies to target anti-PD-1 to individual T cell subsets, we demonstrate that intratumoral CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can independently drive immune remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. The CD8+ and CD4+ T cells that respond to anti-PD-1 exhibit a shared dysfunctional gene program, characterized by tumor-reactivity, terminal exhaustion, effector capacity, and reduced translational activity. Notably, rather than acting through transcriptional rewiring, anti-PD-1 reinvigorates dysfunctional T cells by overcoming this translational barrier, resulting in restored effector function. Altogether, these results reveal dysfunctional T cells as initiators of early tissue responses to PD-1 blockade and identify a novel mode of their therapeutic reinvigoration through restoration of translational control.","[{""name"":""Melanoma Research Alliance"",""id"":""https://ror.org/025ck6r46"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Oncode Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01n92vv28"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Asher Biotherapeutics"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Stevin Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

We have recently shown that mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells co-transduced with cytokine-binding synthetic velocity receptors (VRs, referred to as CAR TV cells) demonstrate increased motility, improved infiltration in solid primary tumors, and lead to a better anti-tumor effect compared to CAR T cells that do not express VRs. However, it is metastasis that causes the vast majority of cancer related deaths and is difficult to target clinically, indicating an urgent unmet need. We show that these CAR T cells engineered to be hyper-migratory using VRs are highly effective against liver metastasis of ovarian cancer along different stages of the metastatic cascade. Mesothelin-targeting CAR TV cells expressing synthetic or native receptors responsive to the cytokine Interleukin-5 improved the survival of mice bearing an extremely high or terminal level of metastatic burden compared to CAR T cells that did not express VRs. Against newly established metastatic lesions and lesions undergoing metastatic outgrowth, CAR TV cells showed a robust anti-cancer effect resulting in an improved prognosis compared to control CAR T cells.

While decades of research have mapped cortical circuits of attention, the causal roles of deep hubs such as the basal ganglia and thalamus remain poorly understood in the healthy human brain. Objectives/Hypothesis: To test whether low intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) of two nodes in the basal ganglia-thalamic network, the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the pulvinar, causally alters visual attention. We hypothesized that TUS-induced modulations in attentional performance would be site specific, reflecting distinct circuit functions. Results: Across sessions, focal TUS accelerated reaction time in a visual search task, indicating augmented attention. Reaction time improvements were observed after stimulation relative to baseline. A dissociation emerged across sites: both GPi and pulvinar enhanced reaction times, but pulvinar yielded more robust benefits for target present trials at peripheral eccentricities, and improved search efficiency in the same trials. Conclusions: These findings provide causal evidence that human attentional control can be steered at deep subcortical sites.

While prefrontal cortex is crucial for this process, it remains unknown how planning is implemented in neural circuits. Prefrontal representations were recently discovered in simpler sequence memory tasks, where different populations of neurons represent different future time points. We demonstrate that combining such representations with the ubiquitous principle of neural attractor dynamics allows circuits to solve much richer problems including planning. This is achieved by embedding the environment structure directly in synaptic connections to implement an attractor network that infers desirable futures. The resulting  spacetime attractor excels at planning in challenging tasks known to depend on prefrontal cortex. Recurrent neural networks trained by gradient descent on such tasks learn a solution that precisely recapitulates the spacetime attractor - in representation, in dynamics, and in connectivity. Analyses of networks trained across different environment structures reveal a generalisation mechanism that rapidly reconfigures the world model used for planning, without the need for synaptic plasticity. The spacetime attractor is a testable mechanistic theory of planning. If true, it would provide a path towards detailed mechanistic understanding of how prefrontal cortex structures adaptive behaviour.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219525/Z/19/Z;225926/Z/22/Z;219627/Z/19/Z;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""GAT3955;GAT3755;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LT0040/2024-L;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 651-2023;""},{""name"":""Fondation Fyssen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05ebnp485"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

These trends are then used to address fundamental questions in the field, including the discovery of potential novel anti-cancer therapies, improvements to species conservation efforts, and understanding how cancer has influenced the evolution of multicellularity. They thus must be robust. This study demonstrates that when estimated on captive species those trends are heavily influenced by their scientific and public popularity, and that accounting for this bias can substantially alter their direction and magnitude. Hence, we reanalysed published captive vertebrate datasets examining the associations between neoplasia, malignancy, and lethal tumour prevalences with body mass, longevity, life history traits, and germinal cells mutation rates. When we included proxies of species popularity in our analyses, the previously reported weak effect of body mass on tumour and malignancy prevalences disappeared entirely. Similarly, the previously reported positive relationship between germline mutation rate and cancer mortality was eliminated after controlling for popularity bias. For life history traits, the effect of clutch size on cancer neoplasia and malignancy prevalences in birds doubled in magnitude, and while the negative trend between gestation length and tumour prevalence in mammals was not greatly affected, our analyses revealed that baseline tumour prevalences were underestimated for popular animals. Finally, the previously observed association between hemochorial placentation and cancer mortality in mammals was eliminated when confounding variables were included. Collectively, these results demonstrate that current comparative analyses based on tumour prevalence in captive animals are heavily influenced by species' scientific and public popularities. Future studies utilising such datasets should incorporate measures of species popularity as confounding variables to ensure more robust conclusions and misleading research directions.","[{""name"":""The Hoffmann Family"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""ANR EVOSEXCAN"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-23-CE13-0007;""},{""name"":""CNRS (IRP CANECEV)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

These peaks were located in regions enriched in retrotransposable elements, particularly L1Tc and VIPER, near strand switch regions, areas of high GC content, and at the boundaries between conserved genes and virulence-factor multigene families. Conclusion: Notably, Hi-C analysis revealed that centromeres may act as structural boundaries contributing to genome compartmentalization and frequently engage in 3D spatial clustering, suggesting a role in higher-order nuclear architecture. Overall, our study provides a high-quality reference genome for the Dm28c strain, presents the first genome-wide centromere map in T. cruzi, and offers novel insights into centromere-mediated 3D genome organization","[{""name"":""Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""18/15553-9; 21/03219-0, 13/07467-1;""},{""name"":""CNPq"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""312142/2021-8;""},{""name"":""Faperj"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""E26/200.384/2023;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SwitchDecoding 101044320;""},{""name"":""Fundação Butantan"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""001/0708/000.244/2025;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

This is largely due to prior research being limited primarily to ecological studies of wild birds. We investigated the dawn chorus under controlled laboratory conditions using an animal model, the zebra finch. We found that birds became hormonally aroused in the dark long before initiating dawn singing, and that suppression of spontaneous singing by darkness enhanced their intrinsic motivation to sing. This elevated motivation subsequently triggered a rebound of intensive singing at dawn. Moreover, dawn singing accelerated refinement of song structure, supporting its role as intensive vocal exercise to optimize song performance after overnight silence. These findings provide mechanistic and functional explanations for the dawn chorus.","[{""name"":""Korea Brain Research Institute basic research program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23-BR-01-01, 24-BR-01-01, and 25-BR-01-01;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K06796;""},{""name"":""ACRO Incubation Grants of Teikyo University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas-premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mice's behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load. We thus provide a framework for how task representations across the cortex reconfigure to support cognitive processes.","[{""name"":""EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 384-2020;""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""U19NS132720;K99MH120047;R00K99MH120047;""},{""name"":""SCGB"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AWD543027;""},{""name"":""C.V.

The avian lower jaw provides a potentially rich source of additional character data, yet fusion of the individual bony elements composing the avian post-dentary complex has impeded efforts to explore its phylogenetic signal. Here, we use high-resolution CT-scanning to separate the individual bony elements of the mandibles of several immature crown birds and key fossil taxa, and use those data to assess support for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses for fossils near the origin of crown birds. Results: We find that evidence from Asteriornis fails to support interpretations of derived mandibular similarities with palaeognaths, and instead strongly favours galloanseran, and specifically galliform, affinities. Our results also illustrate striking similarities in the architecture of the lower jaws between the toothed ornithurine Ichthyornis, Pelagornithidae and Vegavis, which, in addition to the absence of derived features linking them to Galloanserae, highlights questions regarding the phylogenetic position of these perennially controversial taxa. Conclusions: Our data reveal new insight into patterns of morphological evolution near the origin of the avian crown group while raising new phylogenetic questions, emphasising the potential untapped value of detailed comparative investigations of morphological complexes such as the post-dentary complex of the mandible for informing the early evolutionary history of crown birds.","[{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/X015130/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

Here, we introduce a vertically integrated platform for simultaneously tracking single-cell migration and assessing CC under confinement. Our system integrates cell engineering via multiplexed sensors for cell-cycle, actin, and tubulin, as well as photopatterned engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) islands of defined sizes. It also features an automated, high-throughput pattern-aware imaging pipeline (Fab2Mic) that enables on-pattern, joint migration-CC assessment in the same live cells. Since the local microenvironment plays a critical role in metastasis by constraining cell behaviors within spatial boundaries, we used an HT1080 fibrosarcoma model as an illustrative case. Where static phenotyping yielded 40% G1 and 60% S/G2/M, with larger cell areas and tubulin spread in the S/G2/M phase, dynamic phenotyping via live-cell imaging confirmed CC-linked motility, with faster instantaneous velocities in G1, exemplifying the CC-migration correlations. These phenotypes were modulated by the spatial confinement imposed by the engineered ECM islands. Stronger confinement reduced cell area and tubulin spread and increased the frequency of abnormal CC events, particularly Long G1 states on smaller engineered ECM islands. It also induced a confinement-specific S/G2/M-G1 mitotic slippage, observed only under our confined conditions. Together, this vertically integrated system suggests that confinement may continuously tune migration-CC coupling and provides a deployable pipeline for CC-aware mechanobiology and screening. Moreover, we stress how dynamic imaging provides access to variables that are difficult or impossible to infer from static snapshots, including velocity and CC timing.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852560;""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education, Universities and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0166hxq48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R20ZE54CTK;""},{""name"":""European Commission"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00k4n6c32"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101153603;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142273

We developed a predictive model using machine learning to facilitate rational optimization of experimental conditions through contribution analysis and to establish a methodology for designing more favorable sequences.

We investigated the effects of nitrogen, one of the critical environmental factors, on the early stages of tiller bud outgrowth. Comprehensive temporal transcriptomic analyses in response to two nitrogen forms, nitrate (NO -) and ammonium (NH +), identified gene-regulatory networks for nitrogen-triggered tiller outgrowth, with phytohormone signaling as the central interface. Pharmacological, molecular, and genetic experiments established cytokinin-auxin antagonism as a central regulator of the nitrogen-mediated tillering. Cytokinin promoted bud outgrowth by repressing the TCP transcription factor OsTB1, the key inhibitor of tillering, via Cytokinin Response Factors OsERF53/54. OsERF53/54 further reduced polar auxin transport by repressing OsPIN1a to promote bud activation. Conversely, auxin promoted bud dormancy by inducing OsTB1 and OsPIN1a via OsARF11/16. Both NO - and NH + triggered tiller outgrowth and induced largely overlapping transcriptional responses, with a temporal delay for NO -.

Here, we used a collection of 97 genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes to ecogenomically characterise the genus. Our analyses suggest that the genus Methylobacter may contain more species than previously thought, with >30 putative species clusters. Some species clusters shared >98.65% sequence identity of the full-length 16S rRNA gene, demonstrating the need for genome-resolved species delineation. The ecogenomic differences between Methylobacter spp. include various combinations of methane monooxygenases, multigene loci for alternative dissimilatory metabolisms related to hydrogen, sulphur cycling, and denitrification, as well as other lifestyle-associated functions. Additionally, we describe and tentatively name the two new Methylobacter species, which we recently cultured from sediment of a temperate eutrophic fishpond, as Methylobacter methanoversatilis, sp. nov. and Methylobacter spei, sp. nov.

Modelling approaches have enabled researchers to traverse the vast search space of genetic circuits more efficiently, while machine learning has proven useful for designing parts and predicting their function or evolutionary properties. Generative algorithms have the potential to leverage these features to design entire genetic circuits from the sequence level, but have only recently begun to be applied to synthetic biological applications. Here, we show that even simple generative models like the conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) can produce novel genetic circuits that match complex dynamic functions such as signal adaptation. Using in silico RNA simulation, we construct a dataset of RNA sequences and convert them to circuits via RNA interaction predictors, allowing us to estimate functional features alongside evolutionary stability and interpret model-learned features. Our model generates diverse distributions of circuits that match their target adaptation specification well, even when limited to small training data sets. Structures in the embedding space correspond to motifs previously identified as crucial for adaptation and reflect the design rules for adaptable circuits. Framing adaptation as a single design objective outperforms other input representations, reflecting the importance of choosing the correct data encoding for generating genetic circuits. Finally, we show that functional and evolutionary properties can be prompted simultaneously, providing a proof-of-concept for the combined design of phenotype and evotype.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

We show that isolated Paleocene placental assemblages from China (1) reached high tooth size disparity early in the Paleocene, (2) tracked regional and global environmental changes in their dental shape later in the Paleocene, and (3) achieved maximum dental shape-performance integration near the end of the first 10 Myr post-K-Pg. This  brawn before bite transformation, coupled with prolonged dental shape versus performance variability, favors a scenario whereby many living orders of placental mammals were borne out of phenotypically and functionally plastic ancestral assemblages, including those in tropical south China, during the Paleocene.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

While infection is known to impair mitochondrial function and enhance glycolysis, the role of viral accessory proteins in these alterations remains unclear. Here, we investigate the metabolic impact of the accessory protein ORF7a. Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation.

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

Why these chaperones were recruited is unclear, as they are absent and not required in other prokaryotic autotrophs. By retracing the evolution of Rubisco-chaperone interactions, we find that Rubiscos dependence on chaperones evolved neutrally and not by adaptive optimization, and that this may be reversed without compromising catalytic function. Our work shows how chaperones are broad modifiers of their clients sequence spaces that can become totally essential through non-adaptive processes.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101040472;""},{""name"":""Max Planck Institute for Terrestrial Microbiology"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05r7n9c40"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Philipps University of Marburg"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01rdrb571"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 684-2022;""},{""name"":""Marie Sk&#322;odowska&#8209;Curie Actions"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101106795;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

The mechanisms that facilitate immunostimulatory ligand release from microbes during infection are largely undefined. Using the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we describe wall teichoic acid (WTA) as a critical mediator of DNA release from bacterial cells during infection. Mechanistically, we found that the -glycosylated form of WTA, generated by the enzyme TarM, is the primary mediator of bacterial DNA release within macrophages. This process is antagonized by the enzyme O-acetyltransferase, which prevents WTA attachment to peptidoglycan. This competition among peptidoglycan modifying enzymes determines activation of cytosolic DNA receptors AIM2 and cGAS. WTA therefore operates as a meta-regulator of inflammation, by controlling the availability of microbial ligands that stimulate innate immunity.","[{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01AI167993;R37AI116550;T32AI7061;K08AI193234;""},{""name"":""Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01gd7b947"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DRG-123-24;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DK34854;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

Although pain states increase vulnerability to opioid use disorders, the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction remain incompletely understood. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a key site for opioid actions, and emerging evidence suggests that pain states and opioid experience both induce transcriptional, molecular, and circuit adaptations in the VTA that contribute to motivated behaviors. However, the transcriptional responses of distinct VTA cell types to each of these factors (alone or in combination) have not been identified. Here, we employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing to comprehensively define transcriptional alterations in the rat VTA to acute morphine administration in a chronic inflammatory pain model. We report that morphine induces gene expression changes primarily in glial cells and dopamine neurons, with minimal effects in other neuronal cell types. Surprisingly, VTA astrocytes and oligodendrocytes exhibited the most robust transcriptional responses to opioid exposure, despite lacking detectable opioid receptor expression. Among the most highly regulated glial genes was Fkbp5, which encodes a co-chaperone protein that acts in concert with heat shock proteins to modulate stress responses. Using pharmacological and CRISPR-based approaches in rat glial cells and human astrocytes, we demonstrate that regulation of Fkbp5 is mediated indirectly through glucocorticoid signaling rather than direct opioid receptor activation. These findings reveal that glial cells within reward circuits undergo profound transcriptional reprogramming in response to opioids through indirect, stress-hormone mediated mechanisms, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-neuronal contribution to opioid-induced neural adaptations.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DA053743;R01DA054714;K99MH127244;""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Neurobiology of Brain Disorders Award;""},{""name"":""UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention and Intervention"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Pilot Award;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

In the brain parenchyma, it is executed by microglia, which are encumbered by large numbers of apoptotic debris generated during development, in adult neurogenic niches, aging, and brain diseases. Emerging evidence suggest that phagocytosis is not limited to garbage disposal, but triggers adaptations in the phagocytes that may have a functional impact. To test it we developed an in vivo model of superphagocytosis induced by low cranial irradiation (LCI, 2Gy) that specifically induced apoptosis in the neurogenic niche of the adult hippocampus, synchronizing microglia in a phagocytic state within 6h and leading to full clearance by 24h. Single cell RNA sequencing and metabolomics revealed an unexpected oxidative stress in post-phagocytic microglia, accompanied by catabolic shutdown, mitochondrial remodeling, increased expression of galectin 3, and production of polyamines that led to cell death and compensatory proliferation. To test whether these changes impaired subsequent microglial phagocytosis, we used a glioblastoma model treated with sequential irradiation to induce tumor cell apoptosis. The phagocytosis efficiency of tumor-associated microglia/macrophages was comparable in the first and second apoptotic challenge, suggesting that the metabolic remodeling induced by phagocytosis was adaptive and destined to sustain their functionality. Finally, we assessed the functional impact of post-phagocytosis adaptations using galectin 3 deficient mice under LCI. We found that the recovery of the neurogenic niche after LCI strongly depended on galectin 3, demonstrating the regenerative capacity of post-phagocytic microglia. Overall, our data unveils the complexity of post-phagocytosis adaptations in microglia, underscoring their unexplored therapeutic potential in brain disorders.","[{""name"":""Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation Competitiveness"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RTI2018-099267-B-I00;PID2022-136698OB-I00;RYC-2013-12817;""},{""name"":""Basque Government"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00pz2fp31"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IT1473-22;PIBA 2020_1_0030;""},{""name"":""Tatiana Foundation Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P-048-FTPGB 2018;""},{""name"":""Alzheimer's Association"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0375f4d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AARG-NTF-24-1304352;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

We evaluated the accuracy, including plasmid reconstruction, of Nanopore long-read only genome assemblies of Enterobacterales.

We sequenced 92 genomes from clinical Enterobacterales isolates, collected in England under a national surveillance program, with long-read Nanopore (R10.4.1, Dorado v5.0.0 super-high-accuracy basecalled) and short-read Illumina (NovaSeq) sequencing approaches. Genomes were assembled using three long-read only (Flye; Hybracter long; Autocycler), and three hybrid assemblers (Hybracter hybrid; Unicycler normal; bold). Three polishing modalities (Medaka v2 with subsampled or un-subsampled long-reads; Polypolish + Pypolca with short-reads) were investigated.

Autocycler circularised the most chromosomes (87/92 [95%]). Plasmid sequence reconstruction was comparable between all assemblers except Flye, all recovering 90-96% of plasmids, although the  ground truth was uncertain. Flye performed worse than other assemblers on almost all metrics. Autocycler + Medaka (un-subsampled long-reads) was the most accurate long-read only assembler/polisher combination, comparable to hybrid assemblies (median 0 [IQR:0-0] SNPs and 0 [IQR:0-1] indels per genome; quality value/Q score, 100 [IQR: 64-100]), with only 4/92 genome sequences having >10 SNPs/indels. Medaka polishing with un-subsampled long-reads resulted in small improvements in indels but not SNPs for both Flye and Autocycler assemblies. Seven-locus MLST, antimicrobial resistance, virulence, and stress gene annotation was equivalent across assembler/polisher combinations.

Nanopore long-read only bacterial genome assembly with Autocycler combined with Medaka polishing (using un-subsampled reads) is similarly accurate and possibly more complete than hybrid assemblies, representing a viable alternative for incorporating high-quality genomic data, including plasmids, into Enterobacterales surveillance.

Impact StatementNanopore long-reads have historically been too error-prone to use alone for accurate bacterial genome assembly, necessitating additional Illumina short-reads to achieve structurally complete and accurate  hybrid genome assemblies for public health surveillance. This increases cost and complexity. Previous studies have shown that recent improvements in Nanopore chemistry (R10.4.1 flowcell) and basecalling (super-high accuracy) allow high-quality long-read only assemblies on a small number of laboratory reference strains. This is the first evaluation, to our knowledge, to assess Nanopore long-read only genome assembly compared with hybrid assembly on a large number of clinical isolates. In addition, this is the first large-scale evaluation of the recently released automated consensus long-read assembly tool, Autocycler.

We show that Autocycler long-read only assemblies are more structurally complete for chromosomal sequences, while reconstructing a similar number of plasmids to other long-read and hybrid assemblers. Most long-read polished, Autocycler-assembled genome sequences have 0 errors (median: 0 SNPs/indels) relative to a short-read polished (hybrid) Autocycler assemblies, enabling accurate annotation of key genes.","[{""name"":""National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

This necessitates continuous RBC production, resulting in [~]200 billion new RBCs made per day to maintain oxygen delivery. Despite this enormous biosynthetic demand, the metabolic pathways supporting erythropoiesis are poorly understood. We profiled metabolites across four independent models of elevated erythropoiesis and a consistent increase in aspartate levels emerged when compared to controls. This suggested a potential role for aspartate metabolism in RBC production. To test this, we deleted the aspartate aminotransferases Got1 or Got2 globally or in an erythroid-specific manner. Loss of either enzyme resulted in anemia, with Got2 deficiency producing a more severe phenotype. Individual loss of either Got or dual Got deletion led to an erythroid defect, where early progenitors accumulated. In human and mouse models of erythropoiesis, GOT1 and GOT2 loss had opposing impacts on aspartate despite exhibiting similar anemic phenotypes, suggesting an aspartate-independent function for these enzymes. GOT1 and GOT2 are also components of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), which regulates NAD(H) homeostasis. However, conditional deletion of another MAS enzyme, Mdh1, did not cause anemia, and alleviating NADH reductive stress in GOT2-deficient cells with cytoplasmic bacterial NADH oxidase (LbNOX) failed to restore erythropoiesis. Instead, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses revealed dysregulation of chromatin histone modifications in GOT-deficient erythroid cells, implicating epigenetic dysfunction as a driver of defective erythropoiesis. Collectively, these findings identify a previously unrecognized role for GOT1 and GOT2 as a central link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation during erythroid development. These insights may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for anemia.","[{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R37 CA015910;RO1 CA025560;R01 CA001120;R01 CA148828;R01 CA245546;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00adh9b73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 DK095201;U2C DK129445;""},{""name"":""National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Division of Intramural Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/023ny1p48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL148333;R01 HL157062;F31 HL172674-02.;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of collinear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.","[{""name"":""University at Buffalo, State University of New York"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01y64my43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TJK laboratory startup funds;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data.

METHODSThe KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin).

Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates).

RESULTSThe rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004).

CONCLUSIONS

Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.","[{""name"":""Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV025280, INV077266;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""226432/Z/22/Z;""},{""name"":""European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773830;""},{""name"":""Trond Mohn Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TMF2019TMT03;""},{""name"":""SARA project (Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance in Africa, through a grant from the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs within the Fonds de solidarité pour les projets innovants (FSPI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Health Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""UK Vietnam MRC Newton Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/N029399/1 RG83380;""},{""name"":""National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Protection Research Unit in Healthcare Associated Infections and Antimicrobial Resistance"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIHR207397;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors1-5, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5U19NS113201;5R01DA05975;1K99DA060290;""},{""name"":""Simons Collaboration on Global Brain"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

However, this knowledge is fragmented across resources and often is not directly accessible for analytical methods. We developed OmniPath (https://omnipathdb.org/), a database combining diverse molecular knowledge from 168 resources. It covers causal protein-protein, gene regulatory, miRNA, and enzyme-PTM (post-translational modification) interactions, cell-cell communication, protein complexes, and information about the function, localization, structure, and many other aspects of biomolecules. It prioritizes literature curated data, and complements it with predictions and large scale databases. To enable interactive browsing of this large corpus of knowledge, we developed OmniPath Explorer, which also includes a large language model (LLM) agent that has direct access to the database. Python and R/Bioconductor client packages and a Cytoscape plugin create easy access to customized prior knowledge for omics analysis environments, such as scverse. OmniPath can be broadly used for the analysis of bulk, single-cell and spatial multi-omics data, especially for mechanistic and causal modeling.

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions.

This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells. In sum, our data reveal the complexity of chromatin re-establishment following DNA replication, and suggest an asymmetric chromatin assembly intermediate on each daughter chromatid. These pathways have implications for essential chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and gene silencing at replication forks.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""851564;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Vidi.233.038;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DP2-HG012442;""},{""name"":""W.

Both lineages employ pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), yet plant mechanisms for sensing Gram-positive bacterial MAMPs remain poorly understood. Wall teichoic acids (WTAs), anionic glycopolymers unique to Gram-positive bacteria, are shown here to activate salicylic acid signaling, defense priming, and a non-canonical programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that glycosylated WTAs from diverse Gram-positive species elicit these responses and provide genetic evidence that their recognition depends on two members of the plant-specific CYSTEINE-RICH RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (CRK) gene family, which is absent in animals and whose function remains elusive. These findings reveal WTAs as a novel class of MAMPs in plants and highlight CRKs as key components in their perception.","[{""name"":""DFG"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RI 2920/3-1;GRK 2172;INST 186/1277-1 FUGG;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

LP.8.1 was designated a Variant Under Monitoring by the WHO in January 2025 due to its potential to displace prior circulating variants. Informed by early growth modeling and antigenic analysis, we selected LP.8.1 as a candidate strain for the 2025-2026 vaccine season. Here, we describe the development of updated LP.8.1-matched mRNA vaccine compositions encoding either the full-length spike protein for mRNA-1273 (monovalent) or the membrane-anchored receptor-binding and N-terminal domains for the mRNA-1283 vaccine. Initial in vitro characterization, including structural analysis, demonstrated robust antigen expression and intact antigenic features. Immunogenicity of both vaccines were evaluated in murine models following immunization as either a primary series in naive animals or as a booster dose. LP.8.1-matched vaccines elicited strong neutralizing antibody responses against the homologous LP.8.1 strain and more recently emerging JN.1-lineage subvariants, including XFG and NB.1.8.1. Notably, the mRNA-1283 vaccine expressing LP.8.1 induced higher mean neutralization titers than the mRNA-1273 version across multiple variants. These data demonstrate the immunogenicity and breadth of both LP.8.1-based mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1283 vaccines in the context of ongoing JN.1 lineage evolution and support the selection of LP.8.1 as the updated vaccine antigen for the 2025-2026 season.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274

We developed highly efficient, in vivo RNA electroporation-based single-cell gene editing to investigate neuronal responses to loss of fast inhibition. Using CRISPR-Cas9 components delivered as RNA, we knocked out GABA-A receptor {beta} subunits in individual layer 2/3 cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex, eliminating fast inhibition. In vivo patch-clamp recordings revealed that cortical neurons adapted to inhibition loss through two sequential mechanisms: a transient reduction of excitatory synaptic input, followed by intrinsic membrane property changes that decreased input resistance. This sequential adaptation program ultimately prevented target neurons from contributing spikes to the cortical network. Our RNA-based single-cell gene editing approach enables investigation of cellular responses independent of network effects, providing new insights into neuronal homeostasis and gene function in individual cells in vivo.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1759270142274
