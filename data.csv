ObjectiveAssess the duration and severity of autonomic dysfunction in adults with Long COVID and evaluate its impact on function and quality of life.

DesignA follow-up survey of a subset of participants from a cross-sectional online survey of adults with Long COVID. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction.

Participants526 adults (ages 20-65) with a history of Long COVID

Main measuresThe Composite Autonomic Symptom 31 (COMPASS-31) score, the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, the prevalence of new postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and predictors of autonomic dysfunction, including POTS

Key results71.9% of Long COVID patients had a COMPASS-31 score >20, suggestive of moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction. The median symptom duration was 36 [30-40] months, reaching up to 3.5 years after SARS-CoV-2 infection. 37.5% of Long COVID patients could no longer work or had to drop out of school due to their Long COVID illness. 40.5% were newly diagnosed with POTS following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ConclusionsEvidence of persistent moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was seen in 71.9% of Long COVID patients in our study, with a 36-month median symptom duration, suggesting that enduring autonomic dysfunction is highly prevalent in the Long COVID population. Moderate to severe autonomic dysfunction was significantly correlated with impaired function and capacity, highlighting the need to address POTS and other manifestations of autonomic dysfunction as a key component of Long COVID management.","NA","medrxiv",1729375757016

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757016

However, the translational potential of spatial transcriptomics is still limited by its high cost, hindering the assembly of large patient cohorts needed for robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Path2Space, a deep learning model trained on spatial transcriptomics data to predict spatial gene expression directly from histopathology slides. Studying breast cancer, the model was first trained on one ST breast cancer patients cohort and further independently tested and validated on two other ST cohorts. Path2Space identifies 4,500 genes whose spatial expression is robustly predicted in all three cohorts, markedly more accurate than existing ST predictors. Second, we show that based on the inferred ST, Path2Space accurately infers cell-type abundances in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Thirdly, Applying Path2Space to the TCGA breast cancer cohort we identify three TME spatially grounded subsets of patients that have markedly different survival rates. Fourth, analyzing two large breast cancer patients cohorts treated with trastuzumab, we show that the heterogeneity of the inferred HER2 levels across the tumor microenvironment is predictive of response, concordant with the bystander hypothesis. Finally, we developed a spatially interpretable model for predicting trastuzumab response directly from the H&E-slides. This model's performance surpasses that of existing response prediction models that use measured bulk multi-omics data. Path2Space is the first approach capable of robustly delineating the tumor microenvironment on an unprecedented scale directly from the tumor slides. It heralds the upcoming development of robust spatially grounded biomarkers of patients survival and treatment that promises to transform precision oncology in both the developed and developing worlds.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757016

Host-pathogen co-evolution can cause rapid diversification or loss of pathogen genes encoding host-exposed proteins. The molecular mechanisms that underpin such sequence dynamics remains poorly investigated at the scale of entire pathogen species. Here, we focus on AvrStb6, a major effector of the global wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, evolving in response to the cognate receptor Stb6, a resistance widely deployed in wheat. We comprehensively captured effector gene evolution by analyzing a global thousand-genome panel using reference-free sequence analyses. We found that AvrStb6 has diversified into 59 protein isoforms with a strong association to the pathogen spreading to new continents. Across Europe, we found the strongest differentiation of the effector consistent with high rates of Stb6 deployment. The AvrStb6 locus showed also a remarkable diversification in transposable element content with specific expansion patterns across the globe. We detected the AvrStb6 gene losses and evidence for transposable element-mediated disruptions. We used genome-wide association mapping data to predict virulence emergence and found marked increases in Europe, followed by spread to subsequently colonized continents. Finally, we genotyped French bread wheat cultivars for Stb6 and monitored resistant cultivar deployment concomitant with AvrStb6 evolution. Taken together, our data provides a comprehensive view of how a rapidly diversifying effector locus can undergo large-scale sequence changes concomitant with gains in virulence on resistant cultivars. The analyses highlight also the need for large-scale pathogen sequencing panels to assess the durability of resistance genes and improve the sustainability of deployment strategies.

Author summaryInteractions between plants and their specialized pathogens are often mediated by a sophisticated molecular dialogue. Effectors produced by pathogens serve to manipulate the host but may also be used by the host to trigger defence mechanisms upon recognition. Deploying plants carrying a resistance gene against a specific effector could lead to rapid adaptation in the pathogen. Here, we unraveled such dynamics at the scale of the global distribution range of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. The effector is encoded by the gene AvrStb6 located in a polymorphic region of a chromosome near the telomere. We find selfish elements (i.e. transposable elements) repeatedly inserted nearby the gene, which has likely facilitated the rapid sequence evolution. The effector diversified among continents, and we could predict that the sequence changes likely helped escape recognition by the host receptor. Our study provides one of the most comprehensive views how a crop pathogen diversified a major effector in response to host resistance factors. Such studies facilitate devising more durable deployment strategies of host resistance in order to maintain crop yield.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757016

Monitoring the health of pregnant women and newborns during this period involves systematic prenatal and postpartum examinations, guided by indicators established under the national medical insurance system, collectively termed gestational phenotypes. However, our understanding of the genetic basis of these phenotypes and their intricate relationship with maternal long-term health outcomes remain markedly limited. We conducted comprehensive genetic investigations into 122 gestational phenotypes among 121,579 Chinese pregnancies. These phenotypes included anthropometric metrics, comprehensive blood biomarker measurements, and common gestational complications and outcomes. We identified 3,845 genetic loci, 1,385 of which are novel. Our analyses revealed gestation-specific genetic effects, ranging from proportion 0% to 100% for 23 phenotypes, highlighting genes and pathways predominantly enriched in response to hormones, growth and immune function. Longitudinal trajectory genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses of repeated measures across 24 complete blood cell phenotypes revealed that 17.8% of the genetic variants exhibited significant interactions with gestational timing across five gestational and postpartum periods. Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses of 220 mid- and old-age phenotypes suggested causal associations between gestational phenotypes and the risk of chronic diseases in later life.

Sema4ab is expressed by macrophages and gene ablation doubles the rate of regenerative neurogenesis. Disruption of the sema4ab receptor plxnb1a/b, expressed by spinal progenitor cells, also moderately increases regenerative neurogenesis. In addition, single cell transcriptomics reveals altered interactions between macrophages and multiple additional cell types after sema4ab disruption. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are down-regulated and fibroblasts upregulate expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine tgfb3. Inhibition of tgfb3 abolishes effects of sema4ab disruption on regenerative neurogenesis. This highlights sema4ab as a direct and indirect inhibitor of regenerative neurogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target in non-regenerating mammals.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757016

However, little is known about the mechanistic basis and functional role of specific forms of EMT in cancer. Here we address this question in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells that enter a dormancy period in response to TGF-{beta} upon disseminating to distant sites. LUAD cells with the capacity to enter dormancy are characterized by expression of SOX2 and NKX2-1 primitive progenitor markers. In these cells, TGF-{beta} induces growth inhibition accompanied by a full EMT response that subsequently transitions into an atypical mesenchymal state of round morphology and lacking actin stress fibers. TGF-{beta} induces this transition by driving the expression of the actin-depolymerizing factor gelsolin, which changes a migratory, stress fiber-rich mesenchymal phenotype into a cortical actin-rich, spheroidal state. This transition lowers the biomechanical stiffness of metastatic progenitors, protecting them from killing by mechanosensitive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells. Inhibiting this actin depolymerization process clears tissues of dormant metastatic cells. Thus, LUAD primitive progenitors undergo an atypical EMT as part of a strategy to evade immune-mediated elimination during dormancy. Our results provide a mechanistic basis and functional role of this atypical EMT response of LUAD metastatic progenitors and further illuminate the role of TGF-{beta} as a crucial driver of immune evasive metastatic dormancy.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757016

Here we develop minimally invasive optical clearing media for fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues. Light scattering is minimized by adding spherical polymers with low osmolarity to the extracellular medium. A clearing medium containing bovine serum albumin (SeeDB-Live) is minimally invasive to live cells, allowing for structural and functional imaging of live tissues, such as spheroids, organoids, acute brain slices, and the mouse brain in vivo. SeeDB-Live minimally affects the electrophysiological properties and sensory responses of neurons. We demonstrate its utility for widefield imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics, such as backpropagating action potentials, in acute brain slices. We also utilize SeeDB-Live for widefield voltage imaging of dozens of dendrites in vivo, demonstrating population dynamics. Thus, SeeDB-Live expands the scale and modalities of fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

However, most studies of GPCR-lipid interactions have been carried out in mixed micelles or lipid nanodiscs. Though useful, these membrane mimetics do not fully replicate the physical properties of native cellular membranes associated with large assemblies of lipids. We investigated the conformational equilibria of the human A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR) in phospholipid vesicles using 19F solid-state magic angle spinning NMR (SSNMR). By applying an optimized sample preparation workflow and experimental conditions, we were able to obtain 19F-SSNMR spectra for both antagonist- and agonist-bound complexes with sensitivity and line widths closely comparable to those achieved using solution NMR. This facilitated a direct comparison of the A2AAR conformational equilibria across detergent micelle, lipid nanodisc, and lipid vesicle preparations. While antagonist-bound A2AAR showed a similar conformational equilibria across all membrane and membrane mimetic systems, the conformational equilibria of agonist-bound A2AAR exhibited differences among different environments. This suggests that the conformational equilibria of GPCRs may be influenced not only by specific receptor-lipid interactions but also by the membrane properties found in larger lipid assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

There exists extensive heterogeneity in skeletal muscle functional behaviour and molecular landscape, at the cell composition, myofiber sub-type and intra-myofiber sub-type level. This heterogeneity highlights limitations in currently applied methodological approaches, which has stagnated our understanding of fundamental skeletal muscle biology in both healthy and myopathic contexts. Here, we developed a novel approach that combines a fluorescence based assay for the biophysical examination of the sarcomeric protein, myosin, coupled with same-myofiber high sensitivity proteome profiling, termed Single Myofiber Protein Function-Omics (SMPFO). Successfully applying this approach to healthy human skeletal muscle tissue, we identify the integrate relationship between myofiber functionality and the underlying proteomic landscape that guides divergent, but physiologically important, behaviour in myofiber sub-types. By applying SMPFO to two forms of human nemaline myopathy (ACTA1 and TNNT1 mutations), we reveal significant reduction in the divergence of myofiber sub-types, across both biophysical and proteomic behaviour. Collectively, we develop SMPFO as a novel approach to study skeletal muscle with greater specificity, accuracy and resolution then currently applied methods, facilitating that advancement in understanding of SkM tissue in both healthy and diseased states.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

To address this question, we exposed developing neocortical cells to various environmental conditions and examined how this affects cell fate and diversity. Our developmental analyses reveal a hierarchical molecular program in which cell class-distinguishing features emerge first, followed by subclass- and type-related characteristics, with distinct developmental paces among cell populations. Environmental contribution was assessed in vivo, using genetically modified mice models in which position or innervation are altered, and in vitro using two-dimensional cultures. Acquisition of cellular identity and diversity remained stable across in vivo models. In contrast, in vitro glutamatergic neurons showed decreased expression of identity-defining genes, reduced diversity and alterations in canonical cortical connectivity. Cellular identity and diversity were restored towards in vivo values in organotypic slice cultures.

Thus, drug discovery and repurposing are essential to enhance treatment efficacy and safety.

MethodsWe obtained summary statistics for protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) of 2,004 plasma proteins and 1,443 brain proteins, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MS susceptibility with 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 8,000 genes in peripheral blood and 16,704 genes in brain tissue. Our integrative analysis included a proteome-wide association study to identify MS-associated proteins, followed by summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) to determine causal associations. We used the HEIDI test and Bayesian colocalization analysis to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage. Proteins passing SMR, HEIDI, and colocalization analyses were considered potential drug targets. We further conducted pathway annotations, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and examined mRNA levels of these targets.

ResultsWe identified hundreds of MS-associated proteins in plasma and brain, confirming the causal roles of 18 proteins (nine in plasma and nine in brain). Among these, we found 78 annotated pathways and 16 existing non-MS drugs targeting six proteins. We also discovered intricate PPIs among seven potential drug targets and 19 existing MS drug targets, as well as PPIs of four targets across plasma and brain. Combining expression data, we identified two targets adhering to the central dogma of molecular biology.

To proceed unhindered, pol {delta} holoenzymes must bypass lesions without stalling. This entails dNMP incorporation opposite the lesion (insertion) and the 5' template nucleotide (extension). Historically, it was viewed that high-fidelity pol holoenzymes stall upon encountering lesions, activating DNA damage tolerance pathways that are ultimately responsible for lesion bypass. Our recent study of 4 prominent lesions revealed that human pol {delta} holoenzymes support insertion and/or bypass for multiple lesions and the extents of these activities depends on the lesion and pol {delta} proofreading. In the present study, we expand these analyses to other prominent lesions. Collectively, analyses of 10 lesions from both studies reveal that the insertion and bypass efficiencies of pol {delta} holoenzymes each span a complete range (0 to 100%). Consequently, the fates of pol {delta} holoenzymes upon encountering lesions are quite diverse. Furthermore, pol {delta} proofreading promoted holoenzyme progression at 7 of the 10 lesions and did not deter progression at any.

Evolution has woven the LC into wide-ranging neural circuits that influence functions as broad as autonomic systems, the stress response, nociception, sleep, and high-level cognition among others. Given this conservation, there is a strong possibility that LC activity is inherently similar across species, and furthermore that age, sex, and brain state influence LC activity similarly across species. The degree to which LC activity is homogenous across these factors, however, has never been assessed due to the small sample size of individual studies. Here, we pool data from 20 laboratories (1,855 neurons) and show diversity across both intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as species, age, sex and brain state. We use a negative binomial regression model to compare activity from male monkeys, and rats and mice of both sexes that were recorded across brain states from brain slices ex vivo or under different anesthetics or during wakefulness in vivo. LC activity differed due to complex interactions of species, sex, and brain state. The LC became more active during aging, independent of sex. Finally, in contrast to the foundational principle that all species express two distinct LC firing modes (""tonic"" or ""phasic""), we discovered great diversity within spontaneous LC firing patterns. Different factors were associated with higher incidence of some firing modes. We conclude that the activity of the evolutionarily-ancient LC is not conserved. Inherent differences due to age and species-sex-brain state interactions have implications for understanding the role of LC in species-specific naturalistic behavior, as well as in psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, immunology, and metabolic disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Although the role of IAA and its transport in algae remains unclear, PIN-driven auxin export is probably an ancient and conserved trait within Streptophytes. Among streptophyte algae, Chara represents a genus with a considerable degree of complexity in body arrangement. This study investigates the auxin response and characterizes homologs of land plant PIN auxin efflux carriers in Chara braunii. Through regeneration experiments, we observed that IAA significantly promotes elongation of thallus and side branch development upon thallus tip decapitation, indicating an effect on morphogenesis. We show that IAA is actively uptaken and metabolized by thallus cells and that this process is influenced by N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we cloned and sequenced the most expressed Chara braunii PINs, CbPINa and CbPINc. Using epitope-specific antibodies, we showed their presence in the plasma membrane (PM) of vegetative internodal cells and generative antheridial cells. Functional tests in tobacco BY-2 cells, supported by in silico docking of IAA and NPA to CbPINa and CbPINc, showed that PM-localized CbPINa interferes with auxin transport in contrast to ER-localized CbPINc. Finally, our phosphoproteome analysis indicated that IAA rapidly induces specific phosphorylation events, including RAF-like kinase phosphorylation, highlighting a potential role for IAA in fast signaling processes in Chara braunii. Altogether, we provide new insights into IAA role in Chara braunii morphogenesis and suggest that while the canonical auxin transport mechanism may not be conserved, auxin still may likely play a role in rapid signaling pathways in this close relative of land plants.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Results: Glycogen content was 60-65% lower for both fiber types (P<0.01) in the leg that exercised on day 1 (low leg) compared to the other leg with normal level of glycogen (normal leg) before the cycling exercise on day 2. Glycogen utilization during exercise was significantly less in both fiber types in the low compared to the normal leg (P<0.05). In the low leg, there was a 14- and 6-fold increase in long-chain fatty acids conjugated to carnitine in type I and type II fibers, respectively, post-exercise. This increase was 3-4 times larger than in the normal leg (P<0.05). Post-exercise, mTORSer2448 phosphorylation was increased in both fiber types in the normal leg (P<0.05) but remained unchanged in both fiber types in the low leg together with an increase in eEF2Thr56 phosphorylation in type I fibers (P<0.01). Exercise induced a reduction in the autophagy marker LC3B-II in both fiber types and legs, but the post-exercise level was higher in both fiber types in the low leg (P<0.05). Accordingly, the LC3B-II/I ratio decreased only in the normal leg (75% for type I and 87% for type II, P<0.01). Conclusions: Starting an endurance exercise session with low glycogen availability leads to profound changes in substrate utilization in both type I and type II fibers. This may reduce the mTORC1 signaling response, primarily in type I muscle fibers, and attenuate the normally observed reduction in autophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells recognizing WT spike in two individuals of mRNA vaccine, from convalescence of breakthrough infection to acute phase of reinfection. Comprehensive characterization of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after reinfection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency, including 11 mAbs that potently neutralize all tested SARS-CoV-2 variants from WT to KP.3. Among the 11 mAbs, 5 mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rarely reported clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can neutralize SARS-CoV-1 with a minimum IC50 of 0.055 g/ml. Structural and functional analysis further suggests that IGHV3-74 mAbs target a novel epitope on receptor-binding domain and the best mAb, termed KXD352, is highly resilient to variations on this epitope. Overall, this study demonstrates that both public and rare antibody clonotypes primed by prototype mRNA vaccine can achieve extraordinary neutralizing breadth and potency in repeated Omicron infections.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

However, the molecular determinants and functional impact of this additional system of inheritance are poorly characterized. Through comprehensive analyses of severe DNA methylation loss over TEs in an experimental population and in >700 natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana, we uncovered hundreds of TE epivariants in nature, most of which can be inherited independently of DNA sequence changes and thus are true epialleles. Furthermore, natural epivariants are enriched near genes and we uncovered a novel role for the Paf1 complex as a major facilitator of their prevalence. Conversely, related TE copies limit epiallelic variation, by producing the small RNAs that guide DNA methylation in trans. Crucially, natural epivariants mainly affect stress-responsive genes, making them unique targets for selection. Our findings therefore demonstrate that TEs are important mediators of transgenerational epigenetic variation in nature, with singular properties for plant adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

In Bacteroidetes TamA is replaced by TamL, a TamA-like lipoprotein with a lipid modification at its N-terminus that likely anchors it to the outer membrane. This structural difference suggests that TamL may have a distinct function compared to TamA. However, the role of TAM in bacterial phyla other than Proteobacteria remains unexplored. Our study aimed to elucidate the functional importance of TamL in Flavobacterium johnsoniae, an environmental Bacteroidetes. Unlike its homologues in Proteobacteria, we found that TamL and TamB are essential in F. johnsoniae. Through genetic, phenotypic, proteomic, and lipidomic analyses, we discovered that TamL depletion severely compromises outer membrane integrity, as evidenced by reduced cell viability, altered cell shape, increased susceptibility to membrane-disrupting agents, and elevated levels of outer membrane lipoproteins. Notably, we did not observe any impact on outer membrane lipid composition. Via pull-down protein assays, we confirmed that TamL interacts with TamB in F. johnsoniae, likely forming the TAM complex. Furthermore, our in silico analysis revealed that the presence of TamL and TamB monocistronic genes is a shared genetic feature among Bacteroidetes members, including the human pathogen Capnocytophaga canimorsus where we also confirmed the essentiality of the TamL and TamB homologs.

The emergence of new cases in non-endemic areas highlights the importance of early pathogen detection in vectors and reservoirs to generate effective control strategies and establish preventive policies. The objective of this study was to design and validate a detection system of T. cruzi based on specific DNA cleavage and collateral activation using the CRISPR/LbCas12a system, targeting the genes Cytochrome B (Cytb), 18S ribosomal subunit (SR18s), and histone (H2A). This system was validated for their uses in both vectors and reservoirs of the parasite. The first step was to conduct a bioinformatic analysis of the target genes and design RNA guides for each cleavage site and primers to amplify the target region through PCR. Subsequently, we sequenced the amplified DNA target and validated the detection system using T. cruzi DNA extracted from naturally infected Rhodnius pallescens in the metropolitan area of Bucaramanga, Colombia. After standardizing the method, we tested the CRISPR/Cas system with Silvio X10/4 laboratory strain of T. cruzi and scaled up to blood samples of naturally infected Didelphis marsupialis. As a result, we observed the DNA cleavage employing the CRISPR/Cas system with Cytb guide with a sensitivity of up to 0.0475 ng/uL of provided DNA. Sequencing of the Cytb gene showed no mutations in the cleavage site. However, point mutations and indels were found in SR18S and H2A, avoiding the formation of the CRISPR/LbCas12 complex. Furthermore, we introduce the design of a fluorescent detection prototype with CRISPR/LbCas12a called Tropical Diseases Detector (TropD-Detector). This device operates with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm emitted by an LED and a high-pass light filter with a cutoff wavelength of 500 nm. We detected positive samples using any photographic camera system. The TropD-Detector provides a visual, viable, and sensitive method for detecting T. cruzi in both vectors and reservoirs from endemic areas.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Here we used multiple mathematical modelling techniques to analyse and compare existing AP designs. We show that carbon-fixing APs are the most promising candidates to replace native photorespiration in major crop species.

A nonlinear dynamical model that incorporates the experimentally observed cross-inhibition of amino acid production recapitulates the population cycles.

It comprises thousands of microtubules (MTs) that build a scaffold around the distal half of the nucleus. The manchette distributes proteins and vesicles during spermiogenesis in a process called intra-manchette transport (IMT). The current hypothesis is that IMT shares many similarities with intra-flagellar transport (IFT) and utilizes both MTs and filamentous actin (F-actin). However, IMT is still poorly understood as direct visualization of IMT complexes is missing, and the presence of F-actin has not been experimentally shown. Here, we use proteomics and cryogenic-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to identify and visualize IMT components. We find that F-actin is an integral part of the manchette with two different spatial organizations, namely bundles and single filaments, providing tracks for transport as well as having structural and mechanical roles. We further uncover that IMT on MTs is mediated by two distinct transport machineries: dynein mediated transport of soluble cargo and dynein independent transport for vesicles. Our results provide new insights into the manchette's function as a transport scaffold, highlighting its significance for the polarization of spermatids during spermiogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Constantly secreted into the lumen of the intestine, IgA binds commensal microbiota to regulate their colonization and function2,3 with unclear implications for health. IgA deficiency is common in humans but is difficult to study due to its complex aetiology and comorbidities4-8. Using genetically and environmentally controlled mice, here we show that IgA-deficient animals have increased susceptibility to endogenous colorectal tumours. Cellular and molecular analyses revealed that, in the absence of IgA, colonic epithelial cells induce antibacterial factors and accelerate cell cycling in response to the microbiota. Oral treatment with IgA was sufficient to both reduce steady-state proliferation and protect mice from tumours, but this function was due to antibody structure rather than binding specificity. In both organoid and monolayer culture systems, IgA directly suppressed epithelial growth. Co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and a targeted CRISPR screen identified DMBT1 as an IgA-binding epithelial surface protein required for IgA-mediated suppression of proliferation. Together, IgA and DMBT1 regulate Notch signalling and tune the normal cycling of absorptive colonocyte progenitors. In mice, deleting the transmembrane and cytoplasmic signalling portions of DMBT1 or blocking Notch signalling was sufficient to reverse both the increased proliferation and tumour susceptibility of IgA knockouts. These experiments establish a homeostatic function for IgA in tempering physiological epithelial responses to microbiota to maintain mucosal health.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Genetic risk further identified heterogeneous outcomes among ICiCLe risk groups (p<0.0001). Standard genetic risk was associated with superior OS and EFS irrespective of MRD status. We demonstrate the applicability of the WHO5 classification in routine practice and create a general framework for incorporating the WHO5 classification in risk-adapted therapy for childhood B-ALL.","NA","medrxiv",1729375757017

Cis-regulatory alterations and tandem triplication of AhHMA4 result in substantially elevated transcript levels compared to the closely related non-tolerant non-hyperaccumulator Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we identify cis-regulatory Metal Hyperaccumulation Elements (MHEs) necessary for AhHMA4 promoter activity, employing sequence comparisons and motif elicitation analyses combined with progressive deletions and site-directed mutagenesis of promoter-reporter constructs. We report that the promoters of all AhHMA4 gene copies share a distal MHE1 (consensus TGTAAC), and a proximal pair of MHE2s identical or highly similar to the Evening Element (AAAATATCT). Evening elements are known binding sites of Arabidopsis CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a phytochrome-regulated transcription factor in the core circadian clock. We show that the promoter of each AhHMA4 gene copy, but not of AtHMA4, mediates enhanced transcript levels of the reporter and their diel rhythmicity. These functional characteristics are CCA1-dependent and recapitulated by a synthetic reporter construct placing the MHE2 pair into the AtHMA4-promoter sequence context, according to the example of the AhHMA4-1 promoter. Consistent with our observations in transgenic reporter lines, AhHMA4 transcript levels follow a diel rhythm in wild-type A. halleri plants. Different from A. halleri, we identify complex repressive functionalities co-localizing with an upstream lncRNA and an intron in the 5' untranslated region of A. thaliana HMA4. In summary, our work exemplifies how cis-regulatory mutations contributed to the evolution of extreme physiological traits through the co-option of the circadian clock regulatory network.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Here, we performed intravital imaging of microglia mitochondria, revealing that microglial processes diverge, with some containing multiple mitochondria while others are completely void. Microglial processes that engage in minute-to-minute surveillance typically do not have mitochondria. Moreover, unlike process surveillance, mitochondrial motility does not change with animal anesthesia. Likewise, the processes that acutely chemoattract to a lesion site or initially engage with a neuron undergoing programmed cell death do not contain mitochondria. Rather, microglia mitochondria have a delayed arrival into the responding cell processes. Thus, there is subcellular heterogeneity of mitochondrial partitioning and asymmetry between mitochondrial localization and cell process motility or acute damage responses.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

However, the function and full genomic context of these paralogs remains uncharacterised. Here we present a highly contiguous long-read assembly of R. commune WAI453. Using this assembly, we show that the duplication of the NIP2 and NLP gene families is distributed throughout the genome and pre-dates the speciation of R. commune from its sister species. Some NIP2 paralogs have subsequently been lost or are absent in the sister species. The diversity of these paralogs was examined from R. commune global populations and their expression was analysed during in planta and in vitro growth to analyse the importance of these genes during infection. The majority of NIP2 and NLP paralogs in WAI453 genome were significantly upregulated during plant infection suggesting that the NIP2 and NLP genes harbour virulence roles. An attempt to further characterise function of NIP2.1 by infiltrating purified protein into barley leaves did not induce necrosis questioning its previously reported role as an inducer of host cell death. Together these results suggest that the NIP2 effector family does play a role during infection of barley, however the exact function of NIP2, like many effectors, remains uncharacterised.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Most transcriptome analyses to date have focused on leaf-derived galls. To better understand gall formation mechanisms, we investigated stem-derived galls induced by the weevil Smicronyx madaranus on the parasitic plant Cuscuta campestris at gene expression, cellular, and physiological levels. RNA-seq across four developmental stages identified differentially expressed genes and associated gene ontology terms. Consistent with histological observations, genes related to cell division and the cell cycle were upregulated early but decreased as the gall matured. Similar to leaf-derived galls, we found high expression of PLETHORA and meristem-related homeobox genes in early gall development, suggesting that stem cell induction and maintenance are involved in various gall types. Like leaf-derived galls, the expression of genes related to floral organ development increased through the gall development. However, their expression patterns were dramatically different: downstream genes in the flowering pathway were highly expressed at the initial gall stage, whereas upstream genes were highly expressed later. This suggests that the weevil might activate the flowering pathway at unconventional stages, potentially rerouting the typical flowering cascade to influence gall development. Unlike the decrease in photosynthesis-related genes in leaf-derived galls, we observed an increase in these genes in galls formed on the stem of the holoparasitic plant. Shading experiments confirmed that photosynthesis is crucial for both gall growth and the weevil. This study highlights how gall-inducers can co-opt host resources and genetic pathways, offering new insights into the complexity of plant-insect interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

This study demonstrates that inattentional blindness to sensory information undermines successful navigation in Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus, a species that has access to vision and echolocation to traverse natural environments. Bats flew over repeated trials to a perch at a fixed location in the light, allowing them to navigate using both vision and echolocation. The experiment was then repeated in the dark to exclude the bats use of vision. The perch was subsequently displaced by either 15 or 30 cm in one of six different directions (up, down, left, right, front, back). Echolocation behavior was recorded using a 25-channel microphone array, while flight paths were tracked using 13 motion capture cameras. The directional aim of echolocation clicks served as a metric for the bats spatial attention to locations in their environment. In the light, bats modified their flight paths to successfully land on a perch that was moved 15 cm but surprisingly, often failed to land on it when displaced by 30 cm. In the dark, bats often failed to land on the perch after it was moved by only 15 cm. Landing failures suggest that learned spatial priors invoked inattentional blindness to changes in the environment, which interfered with successful navigation. In both the light and dark, when bats failed to land on the perch at its new location, they directed their attention toward the original perch position. Performance differences in the light and dark suggest that the bats attentional spotlight may be narrower when it relies on echolocation than vision. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence of inattentional blindness in a flying echolocating animal, demonstrating that spatial priors can dominate sensory processing during navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

The relevance of these pathways to the development of inflammatory disorders in humans remains unknown. We hypothesized that a comprehensive examination of the ANS-immune network in patients with HIV, would reveal that the type and severity of autonomic neuropathy (AN) would predict immune phenotypes with distinct clinical and demographic characteristics. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 79 adult people with a history of well-controlled HIV on stable combination antiretroviral treatment (CART) recruited from a primary care clinic network within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. All participants underwent a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS) and vagal and adrenergic baroreflex sensitivity (BRS-V and BRS-A). Immune profiling included: 1) measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) as part of the Olink assay Target 96 Inflammation Panel, 2) non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering analyses on Olink immune biomarkers, and 3) mass cytometry (CyTOF) on a subset of participants with and without autonomic neuropathy (N = 10). Results: Reduced activity of caudal vagal circuitry involved in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) predicted higher levels of IL-6 (Spearman's rho = -0.352, p=0.002). The comprehensive assessment of the ANS-immune network showed four immunotypes defined by NMF analyses. A pro-inflammatory immunotype defined by elevations in type 1 cytokines (IL-6, IL-17) and increased numbers of CD8+ T-cells was associated with autonomic neuropathy (AN). This association was driven by deficits in the cardiovascular sympathetic nervous system and remained strongly significant after controlling for the older age and greater burden of co-morbid illness among participants with this immunotype (aOR=4.7, p=0.017). Discussion: Our results provide novel support for the clinical relevance of the CAP in patients with chronic inflammatory AN. These data also provide insight regarding the role of the sympathetic nervous system and aging in the progression and development of co-morbidities in patients with chronic HIV and support future research aimed at developing therapies focused on modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic/vagal nervous system.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

We undertook a comprehensive analysis of the origins of the core eukaryotic genes tracing to the LECA within a rigorous statistical framework centered around evolutionary hypotheses testing using constrained phylogenetic trees. The results reveal dominant contributions of Asgard archaea to the origin of most of the conserved eukaryotic functional systems and pathways. A limited contribution from Alphaproteobacteria was identified, primarily relating to the energy transformation systems and Fe-S cluster biogenesis, whereas ancestry from other bacterial phyla was scattered across the eukaryotic functional landscape, without consistent trends. These findings suggest a model of eukaryogenesis in which key features of eukaryotic cell organization evolved in the Asgard ancestor, followed by the capture of the Alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont, and augmented by numerous but sporadic horizontal acquisition of genes from other bacteria both before and after endosymbiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

This interest has rapidly extended to clinical work, with many reports investigating aperiodic activity from patients from a broad range of clinical disorders. This work typically seeks to evaluate aperiodic activity as a putative biomarker relating to diagnosis or treatment response, and/or as a potential marker of underlying physiological activity. There is thus far no clear consensus on if and how aperiodic neural activity relates to clinical disorders, nor on the best practices for how to study it in clinical research. To address this, this systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, examines reports of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological recordings with human patients with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, finding 143 reports across 35 distinct disorders. Reports within and across disorders are summarized to evaluate current findings and examine what can be learned as pertains to the analysis, interpretations, and overall utility of aperiodic neural activity in clinical investigations. Aperiodic activity is commonly reported to relate to clinical diagnoses, with 31 of 35 disorders reporting a significant effect in diagnostic and/or treatment related studies. However, there is variation in the consistency of results across disorders, with the heterogeneity of patient groups, disease etiologies, and treatment status arising as common themes across different disorders. Overall, the current variability of results, potentially confounding covariates, and limitations in current understanding of aperiodic activity suggests further work is needed before aperiodic activity can be established as a potential biomarker and/or marker of underlying pathological physiology. Finally, a series of recommendations are proposed, based on the findings, limitations, and key discussion topics of the current literature to assist with guiding productive future work on the clinical utility of studying aperiodic neural activity.

In this study, we investigated the role of the DELE1-HRI axis of integrated stress response (ISR) in regulating mitophagy, a key mitochondrial stress pathway. Our findings show that the ISR suppresses mitophagy under non-depolarizing mitochondrial stress by positively regulating mitochondrial protein import, independent of ATF4 activation. Mitochondrial protein import is regulated by the rate of protein synthesis under both depolarizing and non-depolarizing stress.

Without ISR, increased protein synthesis overwhelms the mitochondrial import machinery, reducing its efficiency. Under depolarizing stress, mitochondrial import is heavily impaired even with active ISR, leading to significant PINK1 accumulation. In contrast, non-depolarizing stress allows more efficient protein import in the presence of ISR, resulting in lower mitophagy. Without ISR, mitochondrial protein import becomes severely compromised, causing PINK1 accumulation to reach the threshold necessary to trigger mitophagy. These findings reveal a novel link between ISR-regulated protein synthesis, mitochondrial import, and mitophagy, offering potential therapeutic targets for diseases associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

This is due to limitations in throughput and versatility employed by current instrumentation. Here, we utilise plasma focused ion beam milling to examine the molecular landscape of mouse hippocampus by cryoET in targeted regions across multiple individuals revealing the complex organisation of macromolecules from the CA1 strata pyramidale (sp) to radiatum (sr).

Pausing also contributes to the formation of nucleosome-free regions with the help of chromatin remodellers. However, if these nucleosome-free regions engage with transcription factors to stimulate the transcription potential of paused promoters is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that ligand-induced estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) binding is stabilized at Pol II-paused sites. This stabilization results from an increased dwell time of ERalpha on chromatin, as revealed by single molecule tracking (SMT) experiments. Notably, short chromatin-associated RNAs generated by the paused Pol II contribute to enhancing ERalpha binding at paused promoters. We also observe that pausing increases histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) levels, which primes paused promoters for robust transcriptional activation upon release. Collectively, these findings suggest that paused Pol II plays a central role in enhancing transcription factor binding through an RNA-dependent mechanism. This, in turn, results in a more vigorous transcriptional response following pausing release, thus contributing to the fine-tuning of ERalpha-mediated gene regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

While environmental factors are known to strongly influence plant leaf microbiomes, the role of plant-specific determinants in shaping microbial diversity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the impact of three key plant factors -genetic distance, morphology and leaf micro- and macronutrient content- on the composition and diversity of lettuce leaf bacterial communities. Using 131 fully-sequenced Lactuca sativa genotypes, we analyzed their leaf-associated bacterial communities via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our findings revealed that morphological classification, as defined by breeders, exerts a greater influence on bacterial community diversity than genetic distance or variations in leaf nutrient levels. Together with shoot traits they explained 13.9% of the observed bacterial diversity. Further analysis of 10 specific leaf morphological traits showed that heart formation, head height, and venation types significantly shaped bacterial richness and evenness, mainly acting on non-hub members. The strong association between leaf morphology and bacterial community structure suggests that phenotypic traits play a disproportionately large, yet understudied, role in leaf microbiota establishment offering new potential for manipulation by breeders.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) IMPDH2 forms large multi-protein complexes known as rod-ring (RR) structures that dissociate when ESCs differentiate. Manual analysis of RR structures from confocal microscopy images, although possible, is not feasible on a large scale due to the quantity of RR structures present in each field of view. To address this analysis bottleneck, we have created a fully automatic RR image classification pipeline to segment, characterise and measure feature distributions of these structures in ESCs. Results: We find that this model can automatically segment images with a Dice score of over 80% for both rods and rings for in-domain images compared to expert annotation, with a slight drop to 70% for datasets out of domain. Important feature measurements derived from these segmentations show high agreement with the measurements derived from expert annotation, achieving an R2 score of over 90% for counting the number of RRs over the dataset. Conclusions: We have established for the first time a quantitative baseline for RR distribution in pluripotent ESCs and have made a pipeline available for training to be applied to other models in which RR remain an open topic of study.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

In this study, we have elucidated the structures of the two effectors Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 from the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici using X-ray crystallography and NMR. These proteins shared structural homology with, respectively, KP6 and KP4 killer toxins, encoded by UmV dsRNA viruses infecting the corn fungal pathogen Ustilago maydis. Consequently, Zt-Mycgr3-91409 and Zt-NIP1 were renamed Zt-KP6-1 and Zt- KP4-1. Orthologs and paralogs of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were identified in Zymoseptoria species, but not in other fungi, with the exception of ECP2 effectors related to Zt-KP4-1. A novel pipeline relying on Foldseek and cysteine-pattern constrained HMM searches identified a large number of proteins structurally related to Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 in fungi, and to Zt-KP4-1 in plants. These proteins were classified into distinct structural super families (4 KP4 and 3 KP6) including effectors not known as structurally related to KP4 (ECP2) or KP6 (BAS4). The biological activities of Zt-KP6-1 and Zt-KP4-1 were assessed on plants and fungi. They did not induce symptoms on wheat leaves. However, they inhibited the growth of Botrytis cinerea and Z. tritici, demonstrating their toxicity to fungi. These results highlight the importance of structure determination of effectors for their classification and the prediction of their function.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Recreating these intricate behaviors using well-defined molecules remains a major challenge at the intersection of biology, physics, and molecular engineering. Although the polymerization force of the actin cytoskeleton is characterized as a primary driver of cell motility, recapitulating this process in protocellular systems has proven elusive. The difficulty lies in the daunting task of distilling key components from motile cells and integrating them into model membranes in a physiologically relevant manner. To address this, we developed a method to optically control actin polymerization with high spatiotemporal precision within cell-mimetic lipid vesicles known as giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Within these active protocells, the reorganization of actin networks triggered outward membrane extensions as well as the unidirectional movement of GUVs at speeds of up to 0.43 {micro}m/min, comparable to typical adherent mammalian cells. Notably, our findings reveal a synergistic interplay between branched and linear actin forms in promoting membrane protrusions, highlighting the cooperative nature of these cytoskeletal elements. This approach offers a powerful platform for unraveling the intricacies of cell migration, designing synthetic cells with active morphodynamics, and advancing bioengineering applications, such as self-propelled delivery systems and autonomous tissue-like materials.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Investigations of the consequences of violating these assumptions so far have focused on individual perturbations operating in isolation. Here, we analyze widely used estimators of genetic architectural parameters, including LD-score regression and both population-based and within-family GWAS, across a broad array of perturbations to classical assumptions, such as multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission (parental effects on offspring phenotypes not mediated by genetic inheritance). We find that widely-used statistical approaches are unreliable across a broad range of perturbations, and that structural sources of confounding often operate synergistically to distort conclusions. For example, mild multivariate assortative mating and vertical transmission together can dramatically inflate heritability estimates and GWAS false positive rates. Further, GWAS will become progressively more polluted by off-target associations as sample sizes increase. Given these challenges, we introduce xftsim, a forward time simulation library capable of modeling a wide range of genetic architectures, mating regimes, and transmission dynamics, to facilitate the systematic comparison of existing approaches and the development of robust methods. Together, our findings illustrate the importance of comprehensive sensitivity analysis and present a valuable tool for future research.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Furthermore, iLund4u allows for protein search and proteome annotation functions versus a precomputed iLund4u database.

We lack a mechanistic understanding of how environmental changes reshape this daily profile of rest-activity pattern. Here, we uncover a seasonal switch mechanism that remodels the evening bout of activity. Under summer-like conditions, an environment favored by fruit flies in temperate climates, levels of the PDF neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDFR signaling disinhibits GSK3/SGG to advance the evening output. Upon sensing PDF loss, the neural activity weakens in the DN1p-SIFa circuit, responsible for promoting afternoon rest; leading to an earlier appearance of the evening peak. At the same time, the functional connections from DN1p to LNd oscillators strengthen, consequently handing over the evening pacemaker role to the DN1ps. Taken together, our findings elucidate how environment-induced changes in PDFR signaling tip the balanced output of the clock network, aligning daily rhythms with seasonal time. Neuropeptide-driven parallel adjustment of clock circuitry and clock protein functioning likely represents a conserved strategy across animal species, enabling them to adapt their daily behavior to seasonal changes throughout the year.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

For example, in uniaxially stretched tissue most divisions orient along the stretch axis. This mechanosensitive division orientation can be achieved by distinct mechanisms involving a direct response to force or an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Cells also generally align divisions along their long axis of interphase shape. Since stretching a tissue elongates cells, uncoupling whether divisions orient in response to force or to cell shape remains challenging. Here, we utilised the Xenopus laevis embryonic animal cap tissue, to which a reproducible external stretch can be applied, to understand mechanosensitive division orientation. We focused on nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which is key to spindle orientation. We show that NuMA is dynamically localised to the cell cortex earlier during mitosis in uniaxially stretched tissues. This temporal cortical recruitment of NuMA coincides with the onset and subsequent stretch-induced amplification of spindle oscillations. Additionally, we show that knockdown of NuMA reduces spindle oscillations and disrupts division orientation according to stretch and cell shape. We also show that divisions dynamically align with cell shape under tissue stretch and that this involves a direct response to force via NuMA localisation, rather than an indirect response to force via cell shape changes. Overall, using live tissue imaging, mathematical modelling, and tissue mechanics our results indicate that NuMA fine tunes spindle dynamics and ensures the accurate alignment of divisions with cell shape and anisotropic tension.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

This is however complicated by the highly repetitive nature of these sequences in genomes, requiring the deployment of several problem-specific tools as well as the curation of appropriate genome annotations. This pipeline aims to make the analysis of TE sequences and their expression more generally accessible.

ResultsThe TE-Seq pipeline conducts an end-to-end analysis of RNA sequencing data, examining both genes and TEs. It implements the most current computational methods tailor- made for TEs, and produces a comprehensive analysis of TE expression at both the level of the individual element and at the TE clade level. Furthermore, if supplied with long-read DNA sequencing data, it is able to assess TE expression from non-reference (polymorphic) loci. As a demonstration, we analyzed proliferating, early senescent, and late senescent lung fibroblast RNA-Seq data, and created a custom reference genome and annotations for this cell strain using Nanopore sequencing data. We found that several retrotransposable element (RTE) clades were upregulated in senescence, which included non-reference, intact, and potentially active elements.

NeKo allows users to provide their molecules of interest (e.g., genes, proteins or phosphosites), select interaction resources and apply flexible strategies to build networks based on prior knowledge. Users can filter interactions by various criteria, such as direct or indirect links and signed or unsigned interactions, to tailor the network to their needs and downstream analysis. We demonstrate some of NeKos capabilities in two use cases: first we construct a network based on transcriptomics from medulloblastoma; in the second, we model drug synergies. NeKo streamlines the network-building process, making it more accessible and efficient for researchers. The tool is available at https://sysbio-curie.github.io/Neko/.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Despite their essential role in brain homeostasis, the cell-type-specific composition and function of lysosomes remain poorly understood. Here, we report a quantitative protein atlas of the lysosome from mouse neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. We identify dozens of novel lysosomal proteins and reveal the diversity of the lysosomal composition across brain cell types. Notably, we discovered SLC45A1, mutations in which cause a monogenic neurological disease, as a neuron-specific lysosomal protein. Loss of SLC45A1 causes lysosomal dysfunction in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SLC45A1 plays a dual role in lysosomal sugar transport and stabilization of V1 subunits of the V-ATPase. SLC45A1 deficiency depletes the V1 subunits, elevates lysosomal pH, and disrupts iron homeostasis causing mitochondrial dysfunction. Altogether, our work redefines SLC45A1-associated disease as a LSD and establishes a comprehensive map to study lysosome biology at cell-type resolution in the brain and its implications for neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Various neurological conditions and neurodegenerative diseases benefit from small molecules capable of BBB penetration (BBBP) to elicit a therapeutic effect. Predicting BBBP often involves in silico assessment of molecular properties such as lipophilicity (logP) and polar surface area (PSA) using the CNS multiparameter optimization (MPO) method. This study curated an open-source dataset to benchmark rigorously machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) models with each other and with MPO for predicting BBBP. Our analysis demonstrated that AI models, especially attentive NNs using stereochemical features, significantly outperform MPO in predicting BBBP. An attentive graph neural network (GNN), we refer to as CANDID-CNS, achieved a 0.23-0.26 higher AUROC score than MPO on full test sets, and a 0.17-0.19 higher score on stereoisomers filtered subsets. Regarding stereoisomers that differ in BBBP, which MPO cannot distinguish, attentive GNNs correctly classify these with AURPC, AUROC, and MCC metrics comparable to or better than those of MPO on less difficult test molecules. These findings suggest that integrating attentive GNN models into pharmaceutical drug discovery processes can substantially improve prediction rates, and thereby reduce the timeline, cost, and increase probability of success of designing brain penetrant therapeutics for the treatment of a wide variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Here, we combine morphometric analysis with theoretical modeling and molecular perturbations to interrogate cell shape dynamics during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Using stochastic inference, we extract the morphogenetic landscape underlying EMT. We show that within this landscape, EMT-associated cell spreading reflects a transition between shape attractors. Strikingly, we observe a peak in cell shape noise strength concomitant with spreading, and show that higher shape noise accelerates transitions between shape attractors. Our analysis framework will be widely applicable to quantitative cell shape investigations in physiology and disease. Together, our results identify a key role for cellular stochasticity as a regulator of shape change rates, and highlight that shape dynamics yield rich phenotypic information that enhance our understanding of cellular states.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Two primary mechanisms of cell elimination have been identified in cell competition studies: contact-dependent cell death and mechanical compression-driven apoptosis. While both occur in tissues, their combined impact on population dynamics is unclear. Here we develop a cell-based computational model to study competition between two cell types with differing physical properties. The model integrates cellular mechanics with cell-cycle dynamics, contact-induced apoptosis, and cell extrusion via mechanical stress. Using this model, we explored how differences in physical traits between cell types influence competitive interactions. Our findings show that differences in cell compressibility alone can drive mechanical competition, with stiffer cells outcompeting softer ones in otherwise identical populations. Surprisingly, mutations that reduce cell stiffness, combined with decreased contact inhibition of proliferation, can create a ""soft"" super-competitive mutant. We demonstrate that changes in apoptosis sensitivity, cell adhesion, and cell size significantly affect growth potential and susceptibility to apoptosis. Furthermore, mutant cell colonies require a critical colony size, dependent on cell compressibility, to overtake the surrounding wild-type tissue. For colonies below the critical size, the elimination process is stochastic, driven by a protrusive finger-like instability in the interface between two cells that promote invasion of the supercompetitors.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Antibiotics are known gut microbiota disruptors, but their long-term consequences on taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome remain underexplored.

MO_SCPLOWETHODSC_SCPLOWWe investigated associations between register-based oral antibiotic use over 8 years and gut microbiota composition assessed with fecal shotgun metagenomics in 15,131 adults from the Swedish population-based studies SCAPIS, MOS, and SIMPLER. We applied multivariable regression models with the number of prescriptions in three pre-specified periods before fecal sampling (<1 year, 1-4, 4-8 years) as the main exposures and adjusted for sociodemographics, lifestyle, and comorbidities. Secondary analyses included participants with only one antibiotic course or none.

RO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWAntibiotic use <1 year before fecal sampling was associated with the greatest reduction in gut microbiota species diversity; however, antibiotic use 1-4 years and 4-8 years earlier was also associated with decreased diversity. Clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and flucloxacillin accounted for most of the associations between antibiotic use and the abundance of individual species across all periods. Use of these three antibiotics 4-8 years earlier was associated with altered abundance of 10-14% of the species studied; use of penicillin V, extended-spectrum penicillins, and nitrofurantoin were associated with altered abundance of only a few species. Similar results were found when comparing one antibiotic course 4-8 years before sampling vs. none in the past 8 years.

CONCLUSIONCommonly prescribed antibiotics like clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and the narrow-spectrum flucloxacillin appear to have long-lasting consequences for the gut microbiota.","NA","medrxiv",1729375757017

Here we show through in situ monitoring and ex situ manipulations that methane is rapidly produced by archaea in frequently oxygenated sandy sediments. By combining biogeochemical, metagenomic, and culture-based experiments, we show this activity is driven by aerotolerant methylotrophic methanogens (Methanococcoides spp.) broadly distributed in surface layers of sandy sediments, providing evidence of a hidden process contributing to marine methane emissions.

For routine cell type identification, even randomly chosen features can perform well, but for cell type differences that are subtle, both number of features and selection strategy can matter strongly.

We developed a 3D blood-brain barrier model with enhanced barrier properties using primary brain endothelial cells, astrocytes and pericytes. Exposure to parasite egress products increased microvascular permeability, likely due to transcriptional downregulation of junctional and vascular development genes in endothelial cells. In addition, it increased the expression of ferroptosis markers, antigen presentation and type I interferon genes across all BBB cell types. Incubation with cytoadherent schizont-stage P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes induced a similar, but highly localized transcriptional shift, along with inter-endothelial gaps at sites of parasite egress, significantly increasing permeability.

Alongside these introductions, inhabited and agricultural areas are spreading, and correspondingly most animal introductions occur in populated areas. Commensal species which can live alongside humans by making use of specific conditions, structures, or prey, have a significant advantage. Introduced mammal species often use anthropogenic features in their environment and demonstrate a higher tolerance of human disturbance, but their importance remains understudied in ectotherms. The Aesculapian snake (Zamenis longissimus) is an ectotherm which has been introduced beyond the northern extremities of its natural range.

We investigated snake home range size using Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators (AKDE). Using AKDE-weighted Habitat Selection Functions we identified preferences for habitat features in a mosaic of habitats, and we used Integrated Step Selection Functions to further explore how these features influence movement.

Here, we developed a method to engineer specific mtDNA deletions in human cells by co-expressing end-joining (EJ) machinery and targeted endonucleases. As a proof-of-concept, we used mito-EJ and mito-ScaI to generate a panel of clonal cell lines harboring a ~3.5 kb mtDNA deletion with the full spectrum of heteroplasmy. Investigating these isogenic cells revealed a critical threshold of ~75% deleted genomes, beyond which cells exhibited depletion of OXPHOS proteins, severe metabolic disruption, and impaired growth in galactose-containing media. Single-cell multiomic analysis revealed two distinct patterns of nuclear gene deregulation in response to mtDNA deletion accumulation; one triggered at the deletion threshold and another progressively responding to increasing heteroplasmy. In summary, the co-expression of mito-EJ and programable nucleases provides a powerful tool to model disease-associated mtDNA deletions in different cell types.

Firstly, we used genome-wide association studies to connect genetic variants with the phenotypes. Next, we benchmarked an automated machine learning pipeline that includes preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameters optimization in combination with multiple linear and complex machine learning methods. We determined gradient boosting machines as best performing in 65% of predictions and pangenome as best predictor, suggesting a considerable contribution of the accessory genome in controlling phenotypes. The accuracy broadly varied among the phenotypes (r = 0.2-0.9), consistent with varying levels of complexity, with stress resistance being easier to predict compared to growth across carbon and nitrogen nutrients. While no specific genomic features could be linked to the predictions for most phenotypes, machine learning identifies high-impact variants with established relationships to phenotypes despite being rare in the population.

To achieve these for diploid and even polyploid genomes, the contemporary approach involves a combination of two long-read sequencing technologies: high-accuracy long reads, e.g. Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi or Oxford Nanopore (ONT)  Duplex reads, and ultra-long ONT  Simplex reads. Using two different technologies increases the cost and the required amount of genomic DNA. Here, we show that comparable results are possible using error correction of ultra-long ONT Simplex reads and then assembling them using state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods. To achieve this, we have developed the deep learning-based HERRO framework, which corrects ONT Simplex reads while carefully preserving differences in related genomic sequences. Taking into account informative positions that differentiate the haplotypes or genomic repeat copies, HERRO achieves an increase of read accuracy of up to 100-fold for diploid human genomes. By combining HERRO with Verkko assembler, we achieve high contiguity on several human genomes by reconstructing many chromosomes telomere-to-telomere, including chromosomes X and Y. HERRO supports both R9.4.1 and R10.4.1 ONT Simplex reads and generalizes well to other species. These results provide an opportunity to reduce the cost of genome sequencing and use corrected ONT reads to analyze more complex genomes with different levels of ploidy or even aneuploidy.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

One of their best documented feature is the robust secretion of Reln, a glycoprotein essential for the establishment of cortical layers through the control of radial migration of glutamatergic neurons. We previously identified Gmnc as a critical fate determinant for P73+ CRs subtypes from the hem, septum and thalamic eminence. In Gmnc-/- mutants, P73+ CRs are initially produced, cover the telencephalic vesicle but undergo massive apoptosis resulting in their complete depletion at mid-corticogenesis. Here we investigated the consequence of such a CRs depletion on dorsal cortex lamination and hippocampal morphogenesis. We found preplate splitting occurs normally in Gmnc-/- mutants but is followed by defective radial migration arrest in the dorsal cortex, altered cellular organization in the lateral cortex, aberrant hippocampal progenitor proliferation resulting in abnormal CA1 folding and lack of vasculature development in the hippocampal fissure. We then performed conditional Reln deletion in P73+ CRs to evaluate its relative contribution and found that only radial migration defects were recapitulated. We concluded that at mid-corticogenesis, CRs-derived Reln is required for radial migration arrest and additionally identified Reln-independent functions for CRs in the control of hippocampal progenitor proliferation and vessel remodelling.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

To address this, we present SeqDance, a protein language model designed to learn representation of protein dynamic properties directly from sequence alone. SeqDance is pre-trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from over 30,400 molecular dynamics trajectories and 28,600 normal mode analyses. Our results show that SeqDance effectively captures local dynamic interactions, co-movement patterns, and global conformational features, even for proteins lacking homologs in the pre-training set. Additionally, we showed that SeqDance enhances the prediction of protein fitness landscapes, disorder-to-order transition binding regions, and phase-separating proteins. By learning dynamic properties from sequence, SeqDance complements conventional evolution- and static structure-based methods, offering new insights into protein behavior and function.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Here, we describe Jyvaskylavirus, the first giant virus isolated from Finland. This clade B marseillevirus was found in Acanthamoeba castellanii from a composting soil sample in Jyvaskyla, Central Finland. Its genome shares similarities with other marseilleviruses, including conserved Nucleocytoviricota genes, histone-like genes, and three unique ORFans. Helium ion microscopy and electron microscopy of infected cells unraveled stages of the Jyvaskylavirus lifecycle, such as single virions attached to the cell membrane, likely triggering endocytosis, and virus-rich vesicle formation within the cytoplasm. We also reconstructed the Jyvaskylavirus particle to 6.3 [A] resolution using cryo-EM. The ~2,500 [A] diameter virion displays structural similarities to other Marseilleviridae giant viruses. The capsid comprises of 9,240 copies of the major capsid protein ORF184, which possesses a double jellyroll fold arranged in trimers forming pseudo-hexameric capsomers. Below the capsid shell, the internal membrane vesicle encloses the genome. Through cross-structural and -sequence comparisons with other Marseilleviridae using AI-based software in model building and prediction, we elucidated ORF142 as the penton protein, which plugs the twelve vertices of the capsid. Five additional ORFs were identified, with models predicted and fitted into densities that either cap the capsomers externally or stabilize them internally. The isolation of Jyvaskylavirus, along with other virus-like particles, not only suggests that these viruses may be widespread in the boreal environment but also provide insights extendable to other marseilleviruses, addressing the previously lacking structural data on minor capsid proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Also, GFPs serve as fluorescent tags in size-exclusion chromatography and native-PAGE, facilitating the evaluation of expression levels and quality of the expressed fusion proteins. However, the fluorescent detection of GFPs is generally incompatible with denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), where the samples are heat-denatured before loading. Accordingly, detecting GFP-fused proteins after SDS-PAGE usually relies on western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies. To enable in-gel fluorescence detection of SDS-PAGE-separated GFPs, some protocols employ mild denaturing conditions to keep the GFPs intact. However, such mild denaturation sometimes results in partial denaturation of the proteins and irregular electrophoretic mobility that is not proportional to their molecular weights. Here, we demonstrate that the fully denatured GFPs can be refolded within the gel by cyclodextrin-mediated removal of SDS in the presence of 20% methanol, enabling the in-gel fluorescence detection of the GFP-fused proteins. The protocol is compatible with subsequent total protein staining and western blotting. Although future studies are needed to clarify the scope and generality, the technique developed here would provide a simple, time- and cost-effective alternative to the immunodetection of GFPs.

The most prevalent method for identifying peptides from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry data is database search. Traditional tools typically focus on identifying a single peptide per tandem mass spectrum (MS2), often neglecting the frequent occurrence of peptide co-fragmentations leading to chimeric spectra. Here, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that enhances peptide identification by detecting co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. Utilizing MSFraggers fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DDA+ performs a comprehensive search within the full isolation window for each MS2, followed by robust feature detection, filtering, and rescoring procedures to refine search results. Evaluation against established tools across diverse datasets demonstrated that, integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases identification sensitivity while maintaining stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control. It is also uniquely suited for wide-window acquisition (WWA) data. MSFragger-DDA+ provides an efficient and accurate solution for peptide identification, enhancing the detection of low-abundance co-fragmented peptides. Coupled with the FragPipe platform, MSFragger-DDA+ enables more comprehensive and accurate analysis of proteomics data.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects.

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.

MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.

ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).

Such datasets present new opportunities to learn about evolutionary history, particularly via rare alleles that record the very recent past. However, beyond the computational challenges inherent in the analysis of many large-scale datasets, large population-genetic datasets present theoretical problems. In particular, the majority of population-genetic tools require the assumption that each mutant allele in the sample is the result of a single mutation (the ""infinite sites"" assumption), which is violated in large samples. Here, we present DR EVIL, a method for estimating mutation rates and recent demographic history from very large samples. DR EVIL avoids the infinite-sites assumption by using a diffusion approximation to a branching-process model with recurrent mutation. The branching-process approach limits the method to rare alleles, but, along with recent results, renders tractable likelihoods with recurrent mutation. We show that DR EVIL performs well in simulations and apply it to rare-variant data from a million haploid samples, identifying a signal of mutation-rate heterogeneity within commonly analyzed classes and predicting that in modern sample sizes, most rare variants at sites with high mutation rates represent the descendants of multiple mutation events.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","10.1186/s40168-024-01916-8","biorxiv",1729375757017

Nonetheless, an efficient biochemical approach to separate the distinct protein variants to study their biological functions is missing. Principally being a gap in technology, the HaloTag toolbox lacks affinity ligands displaying good cell permeability and efficient affinity capture. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and validation of a new cell-permeable Biotin-HaloTag ligand, which allows rapid labeling of Halo-tagged proteins in live cells and their efficient separation using streptavidin pull-down. Our work outlines how to use the herein-developed affinity ligand in sequential labeling to biochemically separate distinct protein variants and study their biological properties. The approach holds immense potential for addressing fundamental questions concerning essential cellular processes, including genome duplication and chromatin maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017

Yet, no efficient mechanisms for their removal have been identified. Here we report bioaccumulation of PFAS by several gut bacterial species over a wide range of concentrations from nanomolar up to 500 M. For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites. Despite this high bioaccumulation, B. uniformis cells could grow appreciably up to 250 M perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure. Escherichia coli, which accumulated PFAS to a much lesser extent, substantially increased PFAS bioaccumulation when lacking TolC efflux pump indicating trans-membrane transport in PFAS bioaccumulation. Electron microscopy and cryogenic Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass-spectrometry revealed distinct morphological changes and intracellular localisation of PFNA aggregates. Bioaccumulation of PFAS and transmembrane transport is also evident in proteomics, metabolomics, thermal proteome profiling, and mutations following adaptive laboratory evolution. In an in vivo context, mice colonized with human gut bacteria showed, compared to germ-free controls or those colonized with low-bioaccumulating bacteria, higher PFNA levels in excreted feces. As the gut microbiota is a critical interface between exposure and human body, our results have implications for understanding and utilizing microbial contribution to PFAS clearance.","NA","biorxiv",1729375757017
