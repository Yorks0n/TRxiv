Estimates of long COVID risk after a first COVID-19 infection vary, and data on risk following reinfections remain lacking.

ObjectiveTo estimate and compare long COVID risk and severity with first COVID-19 infection versus reinfections among healthcare workers (HCWs).

DesignRetrospective cohort study based on an electronic survey among Quebec HCWs conducted between May 16 and June 15, 2023. A short telephone survey among randomly selected non-respondents further assessed potential response bias.

SettingPopulation-based study in Quebec, Canada.

Participants397 222 HCWs were invited to participate in the electronic survey and 10 500 in the telephone survey.

Main outcomes and measuresWe defined long COVID cases as HCWs self-reporting COVID-19-attributed symptoms lasting [&ge;]12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity. We compared self-reported symptoms and functional limitations of cases to COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and non-COVID controls (uninfected participants). Risk and prevalence were estimated by number of infections, likely infecting variant and perceived acute COVID-19 severity. We conducted symptom clustering analyses using unsupervised learning techniques.

ResultsEstimated long COVID risk following any COVID-19 infection was similar among 22 496 online survey participants (17.0% [95%CI, 16.3%-17.6%] and 3 978 telephone survey participants (15.9% [14.6%-17.2%]. The cumulative risk increased with the number of infections, but reinfections were associated with three times lower risk of long COVID than first infections.

Pre-Omicron infections and severe acute COVID-19 episodes correlated with higher long COVID risk and severity. Among prevalent long COVID cases, 43% were moderate and 33% severe. Compared to controls, dyspnea, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise and smell/taste disturbances were most strongly associated with long COVID. Cluster analysis identified seven symptom groups with systemic, neurocognitive, pulmonary, and mood-related clusters being the most prevalent. Severe long COVID cases exhibited multiple symptom clusters and greater functional limitations.

ConclusionsLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among HCWs. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes the risk and severity of long COVID differ for first COVID-19 infections versus reinfections among healthcare workers in Quebec, Canada?

FindingsThe risk of long COVID was [~]15% with first COVID-19 infection, but three-fold lower with reinfections. Risk was higher with COVID-19 infections due to ancestral strains and with more severe acute episodes. Long COVID risk and severity compromised self-rated health, physical capacity and cognitive function.

MeaningLong COVID is a common and disabling condition among workers. Societal and healthcare burden remains important and will continue to accrue given ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and long COVID risk with reinfections.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

To define its epitope, specificity, and mechanism, we determine a 2.85 [A] co-crystal structure of J2 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) bound to dsRNA. J2 uses its heavy and light chains in tandem to track the dsRNA minor groove, recognizing a staggered 8-bp duplex. J2 is exquisitely selective for dsRNAs, requires 14 bp for robust binding, and exhibits greatly diminished binding for GC-rich dsRNAs. J2 and R-loop-specific S9.6 antibody share a common recognition strategy distinct from intracellular dsRNA-binding proteins.

Yet, these neural signatures are dissociable at the single-cell level: Specific cells within these visuo-oculomotor areas are exclusively involved in either motor preparation or covert attention. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that many cells in visuo-oculomotor areas are involved in both motor preparation and covert attention, and consequently their neural signatures should functionally overlap to a large degree. Here, we put this proposal to the test: we combined EEG with sensitive decoding techniques to investigate whether the neural signatures of preparatory overt and covert attention are dissociable across large-scale neuronal populations. We found that neural decoding reliably discerned whether overt or covert attention was shifted well before saccade initiation. Further, inverted encoding modeling revealed sharper spatially tuned activity in preparatory overt than in covert attention. We then asked whether preparatory overt attention achieved sharper spatially-tuned activity by using ""more-of-the-same"" covert attention, or by recruiting additional spatially selective neural processing. Cross-decoding results demonstrated that preparatory overt attention recruited at least one additional, frontal process. This additional spatially selective process emerged early and likely reflects motor preparation or predictive remapping. To summarize, we found that the neural signatures of overt and covert attention overlap, yet diverge rapidly, in part because overt attention employs an additional spatially selective neural process. Extending beyond a dissociation on the single-cell level, our findings demonstrate that population-level neural activity dissociates preparatory overt from covert attention.","NA","biorxiv",1747174174434

Few data are available on the combined effect of concurrent underlying conditions on risk of severe outcomes from RSV disease among inpatients.

ObjectiveTo identify underlying condition profiles associated with increased risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV.

DesignWe applied Bayesian profile regression, an outcome-informed statistical clustering model, to identify profiles of conditions associated with increased risk of RSV-associated severe outcomes separately among adults aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years. Seventeen underlying conditions were selected after excluding those with rare prevalence ([&le;]1%) or high pairwise tetrachoric correlation ([&ge;]0.7).

Setting26 hospitals in 20 U.S. states

ParticipantsProspectively enrolled adults hospitalized with RSV disease admitted January 2022-July 2024

Main Outcomes and MeasuresRisks of ICU admission, acute organ failure, and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death

ResultsWe analyzed data from 1111 adults hospitalized with RSV (median age [IQR] = 66 [53-75]). Among 397 adults aged 18-59 years, two profiles were identified characterized by (1) fewer underlying conditions (""minimal prevalence"" profile; 308 cases [78%]; median number of conditions = 1; IQR 1-2) with a posterior median ICU admission risk of 20.5% (95% credible interval = [16.1{square}25.0]), and (2) a cardiorenal/diabetes profile (89 cases [22%]) with frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and increased ICU admission risk (37.1% [27.3{square}47.6]). Among 714 adults aged [&ge;]60 years, four profiles were identified: (1) minimal condition prevalence (460 cases [64%]; ICU admission risk = 21.6% [18.4{square}25.5]), (2) cardiorenal/diabetes (183 cases [26%]; 27.3% [21.4{square}33.6]), (3) hematologic malignancy and transplant receipt (52 cases [7%]; 11.8% [5.7{square}21.0]), and (4) chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence (19 cases [3%]; 44.0% [24.5{square}65.8]). Similar differences in risk were observed for acute organ failure and IMV or death.

Conclusion and RelevanceDistinct underlying condition profiles with varying risks of severe outcomes were identified in adults hospitalized with RSV. These findings could support recognition of high-risk patients to inform RSV prevention strategies and suggest that the role of multimorbidity in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.

Key pointsQuestion: How does multimorbidity influence risk of severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with RSV?

Findings: In this cohort study of 1,111 U.S. adults hospitalized with RSV during 2022-2024, approximately one in four patients aged 18-59 and [&ge;]60 years had a profile of frequent heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes and elevated risk of ICU admission and acute organ failure. Adults aged [&ge;]60 years with chronic pulmonary disease with home oxygen dependence had the highest risk for ICU admission and acute organ failure.

Meaning: The role of distinct multimorbidity profiles in increasing severe RSV disease risk warrants further attention.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

The analysis incorporated imputation for missing data on race and parametric bootstrapping to account for sampling and imputation uncertainty. We found that legal intervention injury rates remained relatively stable over time, with Black individuals consistently experiencing rates over five times higher than White individuals, and Latinx individuals showing moderately higher rates than Whites with some evidence of decline.

Their strict vertical transmission greatly reduces their effective population size, making selection less efficient and driving a pattern of molecular evolution where genome size reduces. Contrastingly, there are sporadic observations of genome expansion in symbionts from clades where the genome has previously reduced in size. It is currently unclear whether these events are an idiosyncratic consequence of exposure to novel active mobile elements, or are driven by the host context. In this paper, we report the concerted genome expansion of two co-infecting heritable symbionts that supports a host-related driver of expansion. We assembled the genomes of Spiroplasma and Rickettsia bacteria that co-infect the lacewing Mallada desjardinsi. Both symbionts had the largest genome reported to date in their clade, approximately twice the median size for their respective genus. Genome expansion was driven by proliferation of mobile elements in both cases, but the underpinning elements were distinct. The observation that the proximate causes of expansion differed between symbionts led us to reject the hypothesis that concerted expansion was driven by a common mobile element invasion. We hypothesize these processes are driven either by bottleneck events impacting host population size, by the host environment causing stress-induced activation of mobile genetic elements, or by both symbionts having undergone a recent and coincident transition to vertical transmission.","NA","biorxiv",1747174174434

A 90% year on year increase from 2022 to 2023 in prevalence of blaNDM in clinical isolates was identified in a clinical microbiology laboratory serving Merseyside, UK hospitals and GP practices in 2023. We analysed isolates identified to disclose the species and plasmid diversity and to understand the mechanism of dissemination of blaNDM across Merseyside hospitals.

MethodsData regarding the sample type, the isolation date and location of samples was collected and analysed to establish initial transmission hypotheses; 64 Gram-negative bacterial isolates which tested positive for blaNDM using routine diagnostics underwent short read whole-genome sequencing. The samples were derived from seven Merseyside hospitals and a Merseyside GP practice, of these, 24 were also long-read sequenced to produce local reference assemblies and enable us to confidently resolve resistance gene locations and plasmids.

ResultsOverall, six species were identified, including Enterobacter hormaechei (n=22) Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=21), Escherichia coli (n=15) Citrobacter freundii (n=3), Citrobacter brakii (n=1) and Enterobacter kobei (n=1). Most multi-isolate species belonged to a number of sequence types (IQR, 1-10), apart from K. pneumoniae where 18/21 were ST101. Four variants of blaNDM were identified: blaNDM-1 (n=43), blaNDM-5 (n=12), blaNDM-6 (n=1), blaNDM-14 (n=1), and in six isolates blaNDM was not identified by sequencing. Long-read sequencing of 24 representative isolates found that blaNDM-1 was commonly encoded by a IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid (82.4%, n=14) whereas blaNDM-5, (n=4) was encoded on different plasmids in each isolate but had the same conserved gene cassette including blaNDM-5 in all instances. Potential evidence of transposition events was noted in two isolates, where blaNDM-1 was found on a small (8.5kbp) untypable plasmid.

ConclusionsThis study captures an outbreak of blaNDM positive Enterobacterales in Merseyside hospitals and highlights the complex epidemiology of spread mediated both by expansion of successful lineages (K. pneumoniae ST101) and plasmids. A dominant IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid that has disseminated blaNDM-1 across different species and subsequently led to small clonal outbreaks within-hospitals. This highlights the cross-species movement of AMR elements as an important factor in AMR dissemination, and the importance of both species-specific surveillance to monitor local outbreaks, but also species-agnostic surveillance to include plasmids spreading across species.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

In coral reefs, dissolved organic matter (DOM) released by benthic primary producers such as algae fuels heterotrophic microbial growth, which can be detrimental to corals. While this microbialization process has been associated with the abundance and replication strategies of bacteriophages, the direct relationship between reef DOM composition and bacteriophage communities remains unclear. Here, we combine metabolomics, metagenomes, and viromes to demonstrate that phage abundances have significant relationships with DOM composition on the reefs of Curacao, Southern Caribbean. By constructing co-occurrence networks between free or cell-associated viruses and exometabolites, we identified thousands of statistically significant associations between phages and organic compounds. While total viral abundances did not significantly correlate with overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, cell-associated phages had significantly more positive associations with compounds that had a reduced nominal oxidative state of carbon (NOSC). Furthermore, temperate phages were more frequently correlated with metabolites exhibiting higher Gibbs energy than lytic phages. Six of the ten viruses with the highest number of positive associations with metabolites were temperate (i.e., encoded an integrase or were identified as a prophage), despite this network consisting of approximately 90% lytic viruses. These temperate viruses were predicted to infect members of the genus Sphingobium. Together, these findings reveal a connection between phage replication strategies and DOM energy availability with potential implications for coral reef biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1747174174434

However, its robustness against pre-analytical variation has not been sufficiently characterized. Here, we systematically evaluate five plasma proteomics workflows--including three bead-based methods and two conventional protocols--using controlled spike-ins of low-abundance proteins and defined cellular contaminants. We find that bead-based approaches enhance detection of low-abundance proteins but can be highly susceptible to systematic bias from platelet and PBMC contamination, even at low levels. This can easily inflate results by thousands of proteins, likely accounting for some of the very high literature-reported numbers. In contrast, a perchloric acid-based workflow shows notable resistance to erythrocyte and platelet-derived contamination. We further investigate how centrifugation conditions, anticoagulant choice, and buffer-bead combinations modulate contamination profiles and demonstrate that bias can partially be mitigated by optimized sample handling. In total, we identify more than 13,000 different protein groups from various conditions, including cellular components from the circulating proteome.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

Here, we quantify the nonlinear, flow-dependent resistance of ETTs with and without a bronchoscope by analyzing pressure-flow relationships across multiple tube-bronchoscope configurations. We find that with bronchoscope insertion, tube resistance increases with the inverse fifth power of the effective tube diameter, defined as the diameter of a circular tube with the same cross-sectional area as the remaining lumen. Using an intensive care ventilator in combination with an active lung simulator, we demonstrate that the increased resistance during bronchoscopy causes dynamic hyperinflation and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) buildup in volume-controlled modes, and reduced tidal volumes in pressure-controlled modes. Numerical simulations using a simple scaling law relating resistance to effective tube diameter accurately reproduce the observed impairments. This demonstrates that the impact of tube narrowing during bronchoscopy can be reliably predicted from ventilator settings and patient respiratory mechanics. We present a predictive model that allows clinicians to anticipate and manage ventilation impairments, supporting evidence-based selection of endotracheal tubes and bronchoscopes. In addition, we provide proof of principle that combining pressure-controlled ventilation with automatic tube compensation can fully prevent these impairments, pointing to a technically feasible solution to an underrecognized clinical problem.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

This study aimed to understand demand for HIV vaccines currently in development, using behavioral economics, examining cross-cultural differences between Nigerian (n=119) and United States (n=63) participants. They responded to three behavioral economic tasks: a simulated COVID-19 Vaccine Purchase Task (CVPT), HIV Vaccine Purchase Task (HVPT) and the Monetary Probability Discounting Task (MPDT). Demand curves were fitted using an exponentiated model with both purchase tasks demonstrating excellent fit (R^2 = .98). Multiple regression analyses examined relationships between behavioral economic indices and demographic factors. Nigerian participants showed significantly higher price sensitivity for both COVID-19 ({beta}=1.10, p<.001) and HIV vaccines ({beta}=0.90, p=.001) compared to U.S. participants, while baseline demand intensity and risk tolerance were similar between countries. Monetary risk-taking behavior predicted HIV vaccine demand ({beta} = -1.10, p = .02), and higher socioeconomic status was associated with lower price sensitivity ({beta} = -1.09, p = .04). The study demonstrates the utility of behavioral economic frameworks in modeling vaccine demand across cultures, revealing cross-cultural differences in price sensitivity and the potential relationship between COVID-19 and future HIV vaccine acceptance. These findings may have important implications for developing targeted public health interventions and policy frameworks for vaccine distribution, particularly in lower-income populations, to ensure equitable access to future HIV vaccines.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

The disease mechanism of ME/CFS is unknown, with no effective curative treatments. In this study, we present a multi-site ME/CFS whole-genome analysis, which is powered by a novel deep learning framework, HEAL2. We show that HEAL2 not only has predictive value for ME/CFS based on personal rare variants, but also links genetic risk to various ME/CFS-associated symptoms. Model interpretation of HEAL2 identifies 115 ME/CFS-risk genes that exhibit significant intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. Transcriptome and network analyses highlight the functional importance of these genes across a wide range of tissues and cell types, including the central nervous system (CNS) and immune cells. Patient-derived multi-omics data implicate reduced expression of ME/CFS risk genes within ME/CFS patients, including in the plasma proteome, and the transcriptomes of B and T cells, especially cytotoxic CD4 T cells, supporting their disease relevance. Pan-phenotype analysis of ME/CFS genes further reveals the genetic correlation between ME/CFS and other complex diseases and traits, including depression and long COVID-19. Overall, HEAL2 provides a candidate genetic-based diagnostic tool for ME/CFS, and our findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of ME/CFS, yielding novel insights into therapeutic targets. Our deep learning model also offers a potent, broadly applicable framework for parallel rare variant analysis and genetic prediction for other complex diseases and traits.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

Acinetobacter sp. Tol 5 is notable for its strong adhesiveness and potential as a biocatalyst for toluene degradation; however, its toluene metabolic pathway has not been fully elucidated. In this study, genomic analysis identified a cluster of genes in Tol 5 highly similar to the well-known tod operon of Pseudomonas putida, encoding enzymes responsible for toluene metabolism. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that these tod genes, unusual among Acinetobacter species, were likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that todF and todC1 are co-transcribed, while the adjacent fadL2 gene, encoding a putative outer membrane transporter corresponding to P. putida todX, is independently transcribed. Functional characterization using gene-knockout mutants revealed that TodC1, the large subunit of dioxygenase, is essential for growth on toluene, whereas FadL2 is not essential. Growth experiments further showed that the todC1 knockout mutant could metabolize benzoate, but not toluene or benzene, confirming that the TOD pathway is the primary route for toluene and benzene degradation in Tol 5. The identification of the functional TOD pathway, which is unique within Acinetobacter, provides genetic and biochemical insights for the development of Tol 5 as an efficient immobilized biocatalyst for the bioremediation and bioconversion of aromatic compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1747174174434

To understand the extent to which biophysics modulates model performance compared to genomic conservation, we model biophysics of IDRs explicitly for improved interpretation of variant effects. We develop MDmis, a method that uses biophysical features extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of IDRs to predict pathogenicity. We find that pathogenic variants in Long IDRs manifest differently, with transient order and depleted solvent access, compared to those in Short IDRs. Using MD simulations of sequences with single missense variants, we identify stronger evidence for pathogenic effects in Long IDRs compared to Short IDRs. MDmis, when combined with conservation information, achieves strong predictive accuracy of pathogenicity of variants in Long IDRs. Overall, extracting information from MD simulations can help understand the drivers of predictive performance and elucidate biophysical behaviors affected by pathogenic variants.","NA","biorxiv",1747174174434

Here, we aimed to establish whether 'monogenic' liver diseases are associated with a spectrum of liver phenotypes in adulthood. Methods We identified 99 genes where pathological mutations cause significant liver disease in children. For each, we used population-level data from over 1.5 million adults to identify associations with biomarkers of liver injury (e.g. ALT). These observations were validated using six external cohorts of adults with clinical liver disease and transcriptomics. Finally, we illustrated the importance of the JAG1-NOTCH pathway on the ductular reaction in adult liver disease using immunohistochemistry and transcriptomics. Results We identified 89 genome-wide (p<5x10-8) associations with biomarkers of liver injury in 46% (45/99) of genes. Variants in ABCC2, ADK, ASL, BCS1L, HFE, and SERPINA1 were also linked with presence of clinical liver disease in adults. For example, rs2862926C>T encoding p.Ile1324= in ABCC2 (which causes Dubin-Johnson syndrome) was associated with lower ALT (p=7.1x10-12) and lower risk of MASLD (p-FDR=0.03). Transcriptional expression of 30% of genes was associated with severity of MASLD. p.Pro871Arg in JAG1 causes a subtle form of Alagille syndrome with higher bilirubin (9.7x10-10) and hypertension (p=4.2x10-14). JAG1 and NOTCH2 were expressed in injured bile ducts but not adjacent unaffected ducts and transcriptional expression of JAG1 correlated with fibrosis stage in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Conclusions Pathways affected by severe childhood liver disease also influence risk and severity of liver disease in adulthood.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

Low-resource settings face challenges in AI model development due to limited data, small sample sizes, and inconsistent data quality. Moreover, models developed from high-resource settings are often not readily applicable in low-resource contexts. Transfer learning (TL) is an AI technology that adapts established models to new settings and offers a potential solution. This study explores the feasibility of TL in clinical contexts, using neurological outcome prediction for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) as a proof of concept. The Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) network provides a multicenter registry for OHCA across the Asia-Pacific region. We applied TL to adapt a neurological outcome prediction model for OHCA, originally developed using a large Japanese cohort (i.e., the external model), to two PAROS registry countries: Vietnam (243 patients) and Singapore (15,916 patients). Separate TL models, calibrated with local data from Vietnam or Singapore, were developed and compared with the external model. Their predictive performance was then compared with that of the external model. The external model performed poorly on the Vietnam cohort, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.467 (95% CI: 0.141-0.785). The TL-Vietnam model significantly improved performance (AUROC = 0.807, 95% CI: 0.626-0.948).

Moreover, the results can be altered just by rotating the phylogenetic tree. Results: We proposed two new phylogenetic methods, Ancestral State Adjustment (ASA) and Simultaneous EVolution test (SEV), which consider the ancestral state of gene presence/absence to evaluate the evolution of ortholog groups (OGs) more properly and guarantee the robustness of the results. In evaluations using three distinct prokaryotic datasets, ASA and SEV showed better performance than methods previously proposed for large-scale data. We compared the functionally related genes detected by each method and found that SEV and its predecessor can identify slowly evolving genes, such as housekeeping genes. In contrast, ASA and its predecessors can detect functionally related genes that tend to be gained or lost in a fixed-order, indicating a strong evolutionary constraint that provides clues for functional prediction. Using matrix multiplication, we showed that SEV is scalable in the latest genome databases.

Deep proteomic profiling of plasma is hindered by the dominance of high-abundant proteins that mask the detection of low-abundant proteins. To overcome this, we compared five plasma protein enrichment methods, MagNet, ENRICHplus, ENRICHiST, EasySep, and EXONET, against neat plasma using LC-MS proteomics. All five methods substantially increased protein identifications, with MagNet, ENRICHplus, EasySep, and EXONET yielding up to 4200 proteins per sample, over 7-fold more than neat plasma, using a 44-minute gradient on the Evosep One and data-independent acquisition on the timsTOF Pro 2.

However, tumors with low intraepithelial T-cell infiltration, often referred to as cold tumors, are expected to yield poor responsiveness to ICB. We investigated the potential of low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) to enhance ICB responses in 25 patients with multimetastatic immuneexcluded solid tumors through a multi-cohort phase I clinical trial (RACIN). Primary endpoint was to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of a backbone treatment, comprising nivolumab, ipilimumab, aspirin/celecoxib, and low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy) in association with escalated LDRT. Secondary endpoints included among others disease control rate (DCR) and overall survival (OS). Exploratory endpoints included biomarkers and molecular correlates of response. The combination treatment showed a manageable safety profile, with Grade 3 or higher adverse events in 12% to 21% of patients across cohorts. The overall DCR was 42%. Progression free survival (PFS) across all cohorts was 2.1 months (95% C.I.: 1.8-4.2 months), with the highest PFS observed in cohort 1 which received 0.5 Gy (5.7 months, (95% C.I.: 1.9-11.3 months). Median OS was 14.0 months (95% CI: 8.5-24.6 months), with one patient with ovarian cancer still maintaining a complete response at three years follow-up. Site-paired tumor biopsies collected for each patient at baseline and after LDRT +/- Cy enabled the comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of excluded tumor microenvironments (TME) at the single cell level. Response to LDRT and ICB was associated with DNA damage and repair responsiveness and the presence of detectable intratumoral PD1+CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at baseline. Our data revealed that LDRT amplified CD8+ TIL functionality in responding patients offering mechanistic insights on how LDRT improves ICB effectiveness. In contrast, we observed a radiosensitivity of TILs in tumors of non-responders. Detailed single cell immune profiling before LDRT also highlighted a lack of key immune stimulatory myeloid cells that can therefore limit ICB efficacy in excluded tumors. Collectively, this study represents the most comprehensive profiling of longitudinal samples of cancer patients treated with LDRT. Our findings highlight several genetic, transcriptomic and TME parameters associated with response to combinatorial LDRT and ICB in advanced immune-excluded solid cancers, generating rationale for their validation in larger cohorts.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

IsomiRs are isoforms of microRNAs (miRNAs) that arise from alternative processing or editing events during miRNA biogenesis. While isomiRs may carry distinct biological and clinical relevance, their potential as cell-free biomarkers in neurodegeneration remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the prognostic utility of plasma isomiRs in ALS. Using next-generation sequencing, we profiled cell-free isomiRs in 154 ALS patients from a British cohort and identified several isomiRs associated with survival. These findings were independently validated in an international ALS cohort of 200 patients. Blood levels of one isomiR, let-7g-5p.t, consistently correlated with longer survival and outperformed others as a single prognostic marker. Moreover, combining let-7g-5p.t with levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) or miR-181, substantially improved stratification of survival outcomes. These results establish isomiRs as a novel class of blood-based biomarkers in ALS and provide a step toward more refined prognostication and patient stratification strategies in clinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

As the hippocampus is pivotal for cognition and dementia, understanding these relations and their specificity for the hippocampus would elucidate microRNA involvement in brain health and neurodegeneration. Here, using population-based data, we cross-sectionally and longitudinally examined the associations of blood-derived microRNAs with left and right hippocampal volume, hippocampal asymmetry, and total brain volume. Expression of microRNAs and their putative target genes was measured at study baseline in whole blood using RNA sequencing. Brain imaging measures were examined at baseline and re-examined 4.60 to 8.02 years later using 3T MRI. We investigated microRNA associations with imaging measures cross-sectionally using linear regression and longitudinally using linear mixed-effect models. Cross-sectionally, six microRNAs (miR-199a-3p, miR-199b-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-6859-5p, miR-505-5p) were associated exclusively with left hippocampal volume. Longitudinally, another five microRNAs (miR-361-3p, miR-4473, miR-381-3p, miR-543, miR-370-3p) were associated with left hippocampal, right hippocampal, and total brain atrophy rates. Twenty-one microRNAs were exclusively associated with total brain atrophy rate. MicroRNAs identified in the cross-sectional analysis regulated target genes involved in brain development, memory, and synapse assembly. MicroRNAs from the longitudinal analysis regulated genes related to axonal and dendritic growth. Our findings suggest an asymmetric and specialized role of the cross-sectional microRNA signature during left hippocampal early-life development and a more universal role of the longitudinal signature during whole-brain aging or neurodegeneration. Importantly, some identified microRNAs have been previously linked to dementia and could be investigated as presymptomatic blood-based biomarkers.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

We investigated whether metabolomic ageing in mid-life is associated with incident dementia and dementia age of onset. We also explored joint associations and interactions with genetic risk, including APOE genotype and dementia polygenic scores.

MethodsThe UK Biobank is a community-based observational study of middle-aged and older adults. The Nightingale Health platform was used to quantify plasma metabolites at baseline. Metabolomic age (MileAge) delta represents the difference between metabolite-predicted and chronological age. Dementia cases were identified from primary care, hospital inpatient, death registry and self-reported physician diagnosis data. Associations between MileAge delta and incident dementia were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.

ResultsAmongst 223,496 participants, 3976 developed dementia. A metabolite-predicted age exceeding chronological age was associated with higher hazards of all-cause, unspecified and vascular dementia (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.28-2.02, p = 0.001). A higher MileAge delta was also associated with an earlier dementia onset. Key contributors to the MileAge clock included lipids, lipoproteins and amino acids, which were also associated with dementia. Genetic risk and MileAge delta were jointly associated with incident dementia. For example, individuals with a MileAge exceeding chronological age and two copies of the APOE {varepsilon}4 allele had 10.27-fold higher hazards of all-cause dementia (95% CI 7.93-13.30, p < 0.001).

ConclusionsMetabolomic ageing in mid-life was associated with incident vascular, unspecified and all-cause dementia, as well as an earlier onset, including of Alzheimers disease. Genetic risk and MileAge delta were jointly associated with incident dementia, likely representing independent pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

Sex and gender mandates were introduced in grant competitions to increase womens health research. This study aimed to understand what type of womens health research is being funded and prioritized in open grant competitions in Canada.

MethodsPublicly available funded Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) project grant abstracts from 2020 and 2023 were coded for the mention of sex, gender, two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (2S/LGBTQ+), and female-specific research and assessed for changes in research representation and funding. A deeper analysis of funded female-specific grant abstracts from 2023 and 2009-2020 was conducted to assess if grant abstracts focused on the 11 areas of global disease burden and death that disproportionately affect females, and if this has evolved over time.

ResultsThe percentage of abstracts mentioning sex, gender and 2S/LGBTQ+ doubled or quadrupled from 2020 to 2023, but remained at under 10% of overall funded abstracts. In contrast, female-specific research representation did not change over time, and remained at [~]7% of all research. Importantly, female-specific research largely focused on cancers (breast, gynecologic) or pregnancy. We also examined research funding representation for the top 11 global burden of disease or death for females across the 13 years and observed that cancer accounted for 2.07% of funding, whereas the other top 10 collectively accounted for 2.21% across 13 years.

ConclusionsDespite mandates for integrated sex and gender based analyses in Canada, research acknowledging which population is explored remains under 10%. Mandates are not affecting the percentage of funding for womens health grants. More efforts and support beyond sex and gender mandates are needed to increase funding for and to diversify female-specific research beyond pregnancy and cancer. Research devoted to womens health factors is key to achieving personalized medicine and improved health outcomes for everyone.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

In CASP16, blind predictions for 42 targets canvassing a full array of nucleic acid functions, from dopamine binding by DNA to formation of elaborate RNA nanocages, were submitted by 65 groups from 46 different labs worldwide. In contrast to concurrent protein structure predictions, performance on nucleic acids was generally poor, with no predictions of previously unseen natural RNA structures achieving TM-scores above 0.8. Even though automated server performance has improved, all top-performing groups were human expert predictors: Vfold, GuangzhouRNA-human, and KiharaLab. Good performance on one template-free modeling target (OLE RNA) and accurate global secondary structure prediction suggested that structural information can be extracted from multiple sequence alignments. However, 3D accuracy generally appeared to depend on the availability of closely related 3D structures, and predictions still did not achieve consistent recovery of pseudoknots, singlet Watson-Crick-Franklin pairs, non-canonical pairs, or tertiary motifs like A-minor interactions. For the first time, blind predictions of nucleic acid interactions with small molecules, proteins, and other nucleic acids could be assessed in CASP16. As with nucleic acid monomers, prediction accuracy for nucleic acid complexes was generally poor unless 3D templates were available. Accounting for template availability, there has not been a notable increase in nucleic acid modeling accuracy between previous blind challenges and CASP16.","NA","biorxiv",1747174174434

Nasal anti-CD3 treats animal models of progressive MS by inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs) that suppress central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and lessen clinical disease.

MethodsTen patients with non-active secondary progressive MS (naSPMS) that continued to progress on B cell therapy were treated with nasal anti-CD3 (foralumab) for a minimum of six months in an open label study. Safety monitoring included otolaryngology evaluation and neurologic assessments including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC-4), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II) and Low Contract Visual Acuity (LCVA). MRI and microglial translocator protein (TSPO)-PET imaging with [F-18]PBR06 were conducted. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic biomarkers and single cell RNA sequencing of blood was performed to evaluate foralumab-induced immunomodulation. The endpoints of our study were safety, clinical effects, microglial signal and immune measures.

ResultsAll patients stabilized on EDSS scores and three of four patients treated continuously for 12 months had improvement on EDSS. Six of 10 patients had improvement in fatigue on the MFIS scale. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or severe AEs and no new T2 lesions were observed on MRI. There was a reduction in TSPO-PET signal over six months (p<0.05). Changes in peripheral blood gene expression occurred as early as three months and affected antigen presentation, interferon responses and regulatory pathways in multiple cell types including FoxP3+ Tregs, CD4+ Tcm cells, CD8+ Tem cells, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes and B cells. TGF{beta} expression was increased across cell multiple subsets.

InterpretationThese findings identify a novel, non-toxic immune based therapy for the treatment for PIRA that acts by the induction of a regulatory immune responses and dampens microglial inflammation. Double blind placebo-controlled trials are warranted to explore nasal foralumab for the treatment of naSPMS.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

However, the lack of scalable and efficient methods to integrate large-scale multi-omics data limits deeper insights into xQTL regulation. Here, we propose ColocBoost, a multi-task learning colocalization method that can scale to hundreds of traits, while accounting for multiple causal variants within a genomic region of interest. ColocBoost employs a specialized gradient boosting framework that can adaptively couple colocalized traits while performing causal variant selection, thereby enhancing the detection of weaker shared signals compared to existing pairwise and multi-trait colocalization methods. We applied ColocBoost genome-wide to 17 gene-level single-nucleus and bulk xQTL data from the aging brain cortex of ROSMAP individuals (average N = 595), encompassing 6 cell types, 3 brain regions and 3 molecular modalities (expression, splicing, and protein abundance). Across molecular xQTLs, ColocBoost identified 16,503 distinct colocalization events, exhibiting 10.7({+/-} 0.74)-fold enrichment for heritability across 57 complex diseases/traits and showing strong concordance with element-gene pairs validated by CRISPR screening assays. When colocalized against Alzheimers disease (AD) GWAS, ColocBoost identified up to 2.5-fold more distinct colocalized loci, explaining twice the AD disease heritability compared to fine-mapping without xQTL integration. This improvement is largely attributable to ColocBoosts enhanced sensitivity in detecting gene-distal colocalizations, as supported by strong concordance with known enhancer-gene links, highlighting its ability to identify biologically plausible AD susceptibility loci with underlying regulatory mechanisms. Notably, several genes including BLNK and CTSH showed sub-threshold associations in GWAS, but were identified through multi-omics colocalizations which provide new functional support for their involvement in AD pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1747174174434

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).
