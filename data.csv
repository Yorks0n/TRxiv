Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071427

However, to be included in national NCS inventories, governments must first quantify the kelp-derived carbon stocks and fluxes leading to carbon sequestration. Here, we present a blueprint for assessing the national carbon sequestration capacity of kelp forests in which data synthesis and Bayesian hierarchical modelling enable estimates of kelp forest carbon production, storage, and export capacity from limited data. Applying this blueprint to Canadas extensive coastline, we find kelp forests store an estimated 1.4 Tg C in short-term biomass and produce 3.1 Tg C yr-1 with modest carbon fluxes to the deep ocean. Arctic kelps had the highest carbon stocks and production capacity, while Pacific kelps had greater carbon fluxes overall due to their higher productivity and export rates. Our transparent, reproducible blueprint represents an important step towards accurate carbon accounting for kelp forests.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical framework, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications. With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows: 1) A new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. 2) The introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information. 3) To simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

In mammals, the head-direction (HD) system is an essential component of the brain's navigation system, yet the stability of its underlying neuronal code remains unclear. Here, by longitudinally tracking the activity of the same HD cells in freely moving mice, we show that the internal organization of population activity in the HD system was preserved for several months. Furthermore, the HD system developed a unique mapping between its internal organization and spatial orientation in each environment. This was not affected by visits to other environments and was stabilized with experience. These findings demonstrate that stable neuronal code supports the sense of direction and forms long-lasting orientation memories.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

Recent studies have highlighted that bacteria possess a large, rapidly changing arsenal of defense genes and that viruses can neutralize at least some of these genes with matching anti-defenses. However, a broadly applicable approach for discovering the genetic underpinnings of such interactions is missing since typically used methods such as comparative genomics are limited by the rampant horizontal gene transfer and poor annotation of viral and bacterial genes. Here we show that genes that allow the viruses to overcome bacterial defenses can be systematically identified using an interpretable machine-learning approach even when using diverse bacteria-virus infection data. To verify the predictions, we experimentally characterized eight previously unknown anti-defense proteins in viruses specific for Vibrio bacteria and showed that they counteract a wide range of bacterial immune systems, including AbiH, AbiU, Septu, DRT, CBASS, and Retron. The power of our computational approach is highlighted by the identification of anti-defense proteins that inhibit non-homologous defense systems, which we verify for Retron and AbiH. We suggest that the computational prediction based on experimental interactions offers a promising avenue to unravel the genetic mechanisms of co-evolution between bacteria and their viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

FACT also interacts with a specialized centromeric nucleosome containing the histone H3 variant CENP-A and with CENP-TW, two subunits of CCAN, a 16-protein complex associated with CENP-A. The significance of these interactions remains elusive. Here, we show that FACT has multiple additional binding sites on CCAN. The interaction with CCAN is strongly stimulated by casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation of FACT. Mitotic localization of FACT to kinetochores is strictly dependent on specific CCAN subcomplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that DNA readily displaces FACT from CCAN, suggesting that FACT becomes recruited through a pool of CCAN that is not stably integrated into chromatin. Collectively, our results point to a potential role of FACT in chaperoning CCAN during transcription or in the stabilization of CCAN at the centromere during the cell cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

Tyrannosaurus rex top speeds have been examined using a wide range of methods that draw on more traditional biomechanical formulas, computer simulations, and allometric equations based on mass. However, these calculations may be made more precise using input from contemporary research on anatomy and biomechanics that account for mass allometry and scaling. This study builds on existing studies in anatomy, biomechanical data, and established equations for locomotion to calculate a muscular driven range of top speed for several (n=4) specimens that had sufficient data to undertake this work. When properly refined with additional data on muscle mass allometry and scaling, several adult specimens of T. rex could confidently be placed in a range of top speed from 7.7 to 10.5 m/s, and possibly up to 10.7 m/s. Additionally, a younger specimen of T. rex was analyzed and found to have a higher top speed than the adult T. rex at 6.3 to 14.5 m/s. Although the estimated top speeds in this study are slower than some previous estimates, these results find some support for slow running gaits and reinforce interpretations of T. rex as an active and effective apex predator. Future work can build upon this study by investigating how muscular driven top speeds may affect ontogenetic niche partitioning and prey species regularly targeted by adult T. rex.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

This study investigates the genetic makeup of SAC individuals, utilizing autosomal genotypes, mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome data. We analyze new genotype data for 125 SAC individuals from seven locations.

Inland regions exhibit higher proportions of Khoe-San ancestry, eastern regions show more Bantu-speaker/West African ancestry, and western/coastal areas, particularly around Cape Town, display increased Asian ancestry. These patterns reflect historical migrations and settlement patterns. Additionally, sex-biased admixture ratios show male-biased admixture from East Africans and Europeans, and female-biased admixture from Khoe-San populations, which is supported by mitochondrial and Y-chromosome data.

Wolbachia strains transferred from other insects to mosquitoes can be released to combat dengue transmission by blocking virus replication and spreading through populations, but host fitness costs imposed by Wolbachia, particularly under some environments, can impede spread. We therefore assessed the impact of two Wolbachia strains being released for dengue control (wAlbB and wMelM) on fecundity and egg viability following extended egg retention (12 or 18 d) under laboratory conditions. Egg viability decreased to a greater extent in females carrying wMelM compared to uninfected or wAlbB females. Fertility fully recovered in uninfected females following a second blood meal after laying retained eggs, while wMelM females experienced only partial recovery. Effects of wMelM on egg retention were similar regardless of whether females were crossed to uninfected or wMelM males, suggesting that fitness costs were triggered by Wolbachia presence in females. The fecundity and hatch proportions of eggs of wMelM females declined with age, regardless of whether females used stored sperm or were recently inseminated. Costs of some Wolbachia strains during egg retention may affect the invasion and persistence of Wolbachia in release sites where larval habitats are scarce and/or intermittent.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

Here, we identify a novel stress response pathway activated by mitochondrial damage that regulates mitophagy in neurons. We find that increasing levels of mitochondrial stress triggers a graded, concerted response that induces proteasomal degradation of negative regulators of autophagy. These include Myotubularin-related phosphatase 5 (MTMR5), MTMR2 and Rubicon. This Mitophagic Stress Response (MitoSR) pathway is neuron-specific and acts in parallel to the classical Pink1/Parkin mediated mitophagy pathway. While MTMR5/MTMR2 inhibits autophagosome biogenesis, we find that Rubicon inhibits lysosomal function and thus blocks autophagosome maturation. Targeted depletion of these negative regulators is sufficient to enhance mitophagy, promoting autophagosome biogenesis and facilitating the fusion of mitophagosomes with lysosomes. Our work suggests that therapeutic activation of the MitoSR pathway to induce degradation of negative regulators of autophagy may enhance mitochondrial quality control in stressed neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1. We then performed a neutralization assay using monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera and breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections. In all cases, the 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.2 was significantly lower than that against JN.1. Particularly, KP.2 shows the most significant resistance to the sera of monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccinee without infection (3.1-fold) as well as those who with infection (1.8-fold). Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718489071427

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy. Design and Methods: Scopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group). Results: 122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses. Conclusions: BMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071427

This process is thought to rely on the generation of mechanical forces along microtubules, the balance of which determines centrosome position. By studying these forces in adherent cells in culture, we found that neither pushing nor pulling forces propagate along microtubules to the centrosome. Inhibiting dyneins or disassembling microtubules did not disrupt the maintenance of the centrosome at the center of the cell. In contrast, the actomyosin contractile network appears to be responsible for the generation of a centripetal flow that drives the centrosome towards the center of the cell independently of the microtubules. Furthermore, we found that centering of the centrosome depends more on the reorganization of cell shape around the centrosome than on an effective centrosome displacement throughout the cytoplasm. Interestingly, despite their lack of mechanical role, microtubules appear to direct this remodeling of cell shape. This revised view of centrosome positioning offers a new perspective for understanding the establishment of cell polarity.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

Despite its importance, both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins of this variability remain largely unknown due to the mixed contributions of cis- and trans-acting elements. To address this issue, we focused on the mutational variability of cis-acting elements, that is, promoter regions, in Escherichia coli. Random mutations were introduced into the natural and synthetic promoters to generate mutant promoter libraries. By comparing the variance in promoter activity of these mutant libraries, we found no significant difference in mutational variability in promoter activity between promoter groups, suggesting the absence of a signature of natural selection for mutational robustness. In contrast, the promoters controlling essential genes exhibited a remarkable bias in mutational variability, with mutants displaying higher activities than the wild types being relatively rare compared to those with lower activities. Our evolutionary simulation on a rugged fitness landscape provided a rationale for this vulnerability. These findings suggest that bias in mutational variability in promoters may constrain the evolution of downstream essential genes toward higher expression levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

We found a cline in short stamen number from retention of short stamens in high elevation populations to incomplete loss in low elevation populations. We did not find evidence that limited genetic variation constrains the loss of short stamens at high elevations nor evidence for divergent selection on short stamens between high and low elevations. Finally, we identified loci associated with short stamens in the Spanish Pyrenees that are different from loci associated with variation in short stamen number across latitudes from a previous study. Overall, we did not identify the evolutionary mechanisms maintaining an elevational cline in short stamen number but did identify different genetic loci underlying the variation in short stamen along similar phenotypic clines.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071427

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

SummaryAmong 47561 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, the 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine was 23% effective against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior COVID-19 vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071427

Whether obesity is associated with an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 infection (PASC) among pediatrics, independent of its impacts on acute infection severity, is unclear. OBJECTIVE To quantify the association between body mass index (BMI) status before SARS-CoV-2 infection and pediatric PASC risk, controlling for acute infection severity. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study occurred from March 2020 to May 2023, with a minimal follow-up of 179 days. SETTING Twenty-six US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Individuals aged 5-20 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPOSURES Elevated BMI status assessed before infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES To identify PASC, we first used the ICD-10-CM code specific for post-COVID-19 conditions, and a second approach used clusters of symptoms and conditions that constitute the PASC phenotype. BMI was assessed within 18 months before infection; the measure closest to the index date was selected. Relative risk (RR) for BMI-PASC association was quantified by Poisson regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic, acute COVID severity, and other clinical factors. RESULTS Among the 172136 participants included, the median age of BMI assessment and cohort entry were 12.8 and 13.2 years, 1402 (0.8%) were identified as having PASC with the ICD-10-CM code, and 74317 (43.2%) had more than 1 incident occurrence of PASC symptoms and conditions. Compared with participants with a healthy weight, those who had overweight, obesity, and severe obesity had 4.7% (RR, 1.047; 95% CI, 0.868-1.263), 25.4% (RR, 1.254; 95% CI, 1.064-1.478) and 42.1% (RR, 1.421; 95% CI, 1.253-1.611) higher risk of PASC when identified using the diagnosis code, respectively. The risk for any occurrences of PASC symptoms and conditions also increased in overweight (RR, 1.030; 95% CI, 0.982-1.080), obesity (RR, 1.108; 95% CI, 1.064-1.154), and severe obesity (RR, 1.174; 95% CI, 1.138-1.213), and that for total incident occurrences increased, too, in overweight (RR, 1.053; 95% CI, 1.000-1.109), obesity (RR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.088-1.188), and severe obesity (RR, 1.182; 95% CI, 1.142-1.223). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Elevated BMI was associated with a significantly increased PASC risk in a dose-dependent manner. The biological mechanisms for this association should be investigated in future research.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071427

Hebbian plasticity depends on temporally coinciding pre- and post-synaptic activity. A tight temporal relationship between motor cortical (MC) activity associated with attempted movement and FES-generated visuo-proprioceptive feedback is hypothesized to enhance motor recovery. Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to classify MC spectral power in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to trigger FES-delivery with detection of movement attempts improved motor outcomes in chronic stroke patients. We hypothesized that heightened neural plasticity earlier post-stroke would further enhance corticomuscular functional connectivity and motor recovery. We compared subcortical non-dominant hemisphere stroke patients in BCI-FES and Random-FES (FES temporally independent of MC movement attempt detection) groups. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). We recorded high-density EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials before and after treatment. The BCI group showed greater: FMA-UE improvement; motor evoked potential amplitude; beta oscillatory power and long-range temporal correlation reduction over contralateral MC; and corticomuscular coherence with contralateral MC. These changes are consistent with enhanced post-stroke motor improvement when movement is synchronized with MC activity reflecting attempted movement.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071427

A multi-omics approach identified two venom proteins of A. japonica necessary for IDD. Knockdown experiments targeting the venom genes revealed that in concert with host immune suppression, IDD is essential for successful parasitism.

Starting with Late Antiquity (late first century AD), we also detect an increasing number of individuals with more southern ancestry, more frequently associated with urban centers - landmarks of the early Christianization in eastern Georgia. Finally, in the Early Medieval Period starting 400 AD, we observe genetic outlier individuals with ancestry from the Central Eurasian steppe, with artificial cranial deformations (ACD) in several cases.

The release of a draft human pangenome underscores the increasing relevance of pangenomics to overcome these limitations. Pangenomes are commonly represented as graphs, which can represent billions of base pairs of sequence. Presently, there is a lack of scalable software able to perform key tasks on pangenomes, such as quantifying universally shared sequence across genomes (the core genome) and measuring the extent of genomic variability as a function of sample size (pangenome growth). Results: We introduce Panacus (pangenome-abacus), a tool designed to rapidly perform these tasks and visualize the results in interactive plots. Panacus can process GFA files, the accepted standard for pangenome graphs, and is able to analyze a human pangenome graph with 110 million nodes in less than one hour.

To circumvent the systemic adverse effects of T3/T4, we have asked in the current pilot study whether topically applied T3/T4 retains hair growth-promoting properties. To prove this, we have topically treated healthy full-thickness human scalp skin with T3 (1, 10nM) and T4 (1, 10M) for six days in serum-free organ culture, using an HF-targeting vehicle that contains only FDA-approved ingredients. This showed that, at distinct doses, topical T3 and T4 significantly increased the percentage of HFs in anagen, decreased the percentage of proliferative (Ki-67+) cells in the hair matrix, did not promote melanogenesis (as measured by quantitative Warthin-Starry histochemistry), and significantly increased keratin 15 expression in the bulge. Finally, T3 and T4, at low concentrations, increase the expression of the hair growth promoters IGF-1 and FGF-7. The lower concentration of T3 and both of T4 also significantly increases the number of CD31+ endothelial cells, suggesting a pro-angiogenic effect, which is also important for hair growth promotion. These preliminary results strongly suggest that topically applied thyroid hormones promote hair growth in intact human scalp on multiple levels ex vivo. This invites the intermittent pulse application of topical T3 and T4 as a novel therapeutic intervention for managing hair loss disorders associated with telogen effluvium, such as androgenetic alopecia.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Our research seeks to introduce a conceptually novel approach towards synthetic life by leveraging RNA origami, as an alternative to proteins, requiring only a single copying step between genetic information and function. Here, we report the genetic encoding and expression of an RNA origami cytoskeleton-mimic within giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). We design the first RNA origami tiles which fold co-transcriptionally from a DNA template and self-assemble into higher-order 3D RNA origami nanotubes at constant \SI{37}{\celsius} in GUVs, where they reach several micrometers in length. Unlike pre-formed and encapsulated DNA cytoskeletons, these GUVs produce their own molecular hardware in an out-of-equilibrium process fuelled by nucleotide feeding. To establish genotype-phenotype correlations, we investigate how sequence mutations govern the contour and persistence length of the RNA origami nanotubes with experiments and coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations, realizing a phenotypic transition to closed rings. Finally, we achieve RNA origami cortex formation and GUV deformation without chemical functionalization by introducing RNA aptamers into the tile design. Altogether, this work pioneers the expression of RNA origami-based hardware in vesicles as a new approach towards active, evolvable and RNA-based synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

The problem has accordingly been considered ill-posed. We hypothesize that similarity judgments may be, in a sense, metacognitive: The stimuli rated as subjectively similar are those that are in fact more challenging for oneself to discern in practice, in near-threshold settings (e.g., psychophysics experiments). This self-knowledge about one's own perceptual capacities provides a quasi-objective ground truth as to whether two stimuli should be judged as similar. To test this idea, we measure perceptual discrimination capacity between face pairs, and ask subjects to rank the similarity between them. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize a positive association between perceptual discrimination capacity and subjective dissimilarity, with this association being importantly specific to each individual.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Here we describe the developing Human Connectome Project's release of the largest open access fetal fMRI dataset to date, containing 275 scans from 255 fetuses and spanning the period of 20.86 to 38.29 post-menstrual weeks. We present a systematic approach to its pre-processing, implementing multi-band soft SENSE reconstruction, dynamic distortion corrections via phase unwrapping method, slice-to-volume reconstruction and a tailored temporal filtering model, with attention to the prominent sources of structured noise in the in utero fMRI. The dataset is accompanied with an advanced registration infrastructure, enabling group-level data fusion, and contains outputs from the main intermediate processing steps. This allows for various levels of data exploration by the imaging and neuroscientific community, starting from the development of robust pipelines for anatomical and temporal corrections to methods for elucidating the development of functional connectivity in utero. By providing a high-quality template for further method development and benchmarking, the release of the dataset will help to advance fetal fMRI to its deserved and timely place at the forefront of the efforts to build a life-long connectome of the human brain.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Using the markerless pose estimation software DeepLabCut, we three-dimensionally track the body of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile. Using these extracted markers, we developed an algorithm which computationally reconstructs the ant's body, directly measuring volumetric change over time. Moreover, we provide measures of accuracy and quantify the ant's feeding response to a range of sucrose concentrations, as well as a gradient of caffeine-laced sucrose solutions. Small invertebrates are often prolific invasive species and disease vectors, causing significant ecological and economical damage. Understanding their feeding behaviour could be an important step towards effective control strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Here, we demonstrate the involvement of the mechanosensitive ion channel, Piezo1, in promoting arterial accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) during zebrafish development. Using a series of small molecule antagonists or agonists to temporally regulate Piezo1 activity, we identified a role for the Piezo1 channel in regulating klf2a levels and altered targeting of vSMCs between arteries and veins. Increasing Piezo1 activity suppressed klf2a and increased vSMC association with the cardinal vein, while inhibition of Piezo1 activity increased klf2a levels and decreased vSMC association with arteries. We supported the small molecule data with in vivo genetic suppression of piezo1 and 2 in zebrafish, resulting in loss of transgelin+ vSMCs on the dorsal aorta. Further, endothelial cell (EC)-specific Piezo1 knockout in mice was sufficient to decrease vSMC accumulation along the descending dorsal aorta during development, thus phenocopying our zebrafish data, and supporting functional conservation of Piezo1 in mammals. To determine mechanism, we used in vitro modeling assays to demonstrate that differential sensing of pulsatile versus laminar flow forces across endothelial cells changes the expression of mural cell differentiation genes. Together, our findings suggest a crucial role for EC Piezo1 in sensing force within large arteries to mediate mural cell differentiation and stabilization of the arterial vasculature.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

We compared in vivo infection in Syrian hamsters with infection in primary human nasal and lung epithelium cells and assessed differences in transmissibility, antigenicity, and innate immune activation. Omicron variants replicated efficiently in the URT but displayed limited pathology in the lungs compared to previous variants and failed to replicate in human lung organoids.

However, existing applications often lack the ability to probe chemical composition and molecular specificity without the need for contrast agents. Here, we present a SWIR imaging approach that visualizes spontaneous Raman scattering with remarkable chemical contrast deep within tissue across large fields of view. Our results demonstrate that Raman scattering overcomes autofluorescence as the predominant source of endogenous tissue background at illumination wavelengths as short as 892 nm. We highlight the versatility of SWIR Raman imaging through in vivo monitoring of whole-body tissue composition dynamics and non-invasive detection of fatty liver disease in mice, and identification of calcification and lipids in unfixed human atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, our approach facilitates the visualization of nerves embedded in fatty tissue, a major advancement for surgical applications. With a simple wide-field setup orthogonal to fluorescence, SWIR Raman imaging holds promise for rapid adoption by clinicians and biologists. This technique opens new possibilities for contrast agent-free visualization of pathophysiology in whole animals and intraoperative imaging in humans.

Ideally, patient data are handled in a fully pseudonymised or anonymised way. However, this can make it difficult for medical researchers to access and analyze large datasets or to exchange data between hospitals. De-identifying medical free text is particularly difficult due to the diverse documentation styles and the unstructured nature of the data. However, recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), driven by the development of large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the ability to extract information from unstructured text. Methods: We hypothesize that LLMs are highly effective tools for extracting patient-related information, which can subsequently be used to de-identify medical reports. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a benchmark study using eight locally deployable LLMs (Llama-3 8B, Llama-3 70B, Llama-2 7B, Llama-2 70B, Llama-2 7B ""Sauerkraut"", Llama-2 70B ""Sauerkraut"", Mistral 7B, and Phi-3-mini) to extract patient-related information from a dataset of 100 real-world clinical letters. We then remove the identified information using our newly developed LLM-Anonymizer pipeline. Results: Our results demonstrate that the LLM-Anonymizer, when used with Llama-3 70B, achieved a success rate of 98.05% in removing text characters carrying personal identifying information. When evaluating the performance in relation to the number of characters manually identified as containing personal information and identifiable characteristics, our system missed only 1.95% of personal identifying information and erroneously redacted only 0.85% of the characters. Conclusion: We provide our full LLM-based Anonymizer pipeline under an open source license with a user-friendly web interface that operates on local hardware and requires no programming skills. This powerful tool has the potential to significantly facilitate medical research by enabling the secure and efficient de-identification of clinical free text data on premise, thereby addressing key challenges in medical data sharing.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071428

The rapid structural changes seen in plasmid genomes present considerable challenges to evolutionary and epidemiological analysis. Typical approaches are either low resolution (replicon typing) or use shared k-mer content to define a genetic distance. However this distance can both overestimate plasmid relatedness by ignoring rearrangements, and underestimate by over-penalising gene gain/loss. Therefore a model is needed which captures the key components of how plasmid genomes evolve structurally - through gene/block gain or loss, and rearrangement. A secondary requirement is to prevent promiscuous transposable elements (TEs) leading to over-clustering of unrelated plasmids. We choose the ""Double Cut and Join Indel"" model, in which plasmids are studied at a coarse level, as a sequence of signed integers (representing genes or aligned blocks), and the distance between two plasmids is the minimum number of rearrangement events or indels needed to transform one into the other. We show how this gives much more meaningful distances between plasmids. We introduce a software workflow pling (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/pling), which uses the DCJ-Indel model, to calculate distances between plasmids and then cluster them. In our approach, we combine containment distances and DCJ-Indel distances to build a TE-aware plasmid network.

Defining the contribution of each cell type to the computational and cognitive processes that are guided by the cortex is essential for understanding its function in health and disease. We use transcriptomic and epigenomic cortical cell type taxonomies from mice and humans to define marker genes and enhancers, and to build genetic tools for cortical cell types. Here, we present a large toolkit for selective targeting of cortical populations, including mouse transgenic lines and recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors containing genomic enhancers. We report evaluation of fifteen new transgenic driver lines and over 680 different enhancer AAVs covering all major subclasses of cortical cells, with many achieving a high degree of specificity, comparable with existing transgenic lines. We find that the transgenic lines based on marker genes can provide exceptional specificity and completeness of cell type labeling, but frequently require generation of a triple-transgenic cross for best usability/specificity. On the other hand, enhancer AAVs are easy to screen and use, and can be easily modified to express diverse cargo, such as recombinases. However, their use depends on many factors, such as viral titer and route of administration. The tools reported here as well as the scaled process of tool creation provide an unprecedented resource that should enable diverse experimental strategies towards understanding mammalian cortex and brain function.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Here, we study how different rhythm structures of the musical signal can guide the temporal dynamics of auditory oscillations phase-aligned to the speech envelope. For this purpose, we investigated the effects of prior exposure to rhythmically structured musical sequences on cortical tracking of speech in Basque-Spanish bilingual adults. We conducted two EEG experiments where participants were presented with sentences in Basque and Spanish preceded by musical sequences that differed in their beat structure. The beat structure of the musical sequences was created to 1) reflect and match the syllabic structure of the sentences, 2) reflect a regular rhythm but not match the syllabic structure of the sentences, and 3) follow an irregular rhythm. First, we showed that the regularity found in the rhythmic structure of music acts as a temporal guide for brain oscillations. Second, our findings suggest that not only the regularity in music is crucial but so is adjusting this regularity to optimally reflect the rhythmic characteristics of the language. Third, despite finding some differences across frequencies for each language, we still found a strong effect of rhythm regularity on cortical tracking of speech. We showed that rhythm, inherent in musical signals, guides the adaptation of brain oscillations, by adapting the temporal dynamics of the oscillatory activity to the rhythmic scaffolding of the musical signal.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

To define the anatomical substrates of evolutionary change in the nervous system, we undertook an electron micrographic reconstruction of the brain of the predatory nematode Pristionchus pacificus. A comparison with the brain of Caenorhabditis elegans, which diverged at least 100 million years ago, reveals a conserved nematode core connectome and a wide range of specific substrates of evolutionary change. These changes include differences in neuronal cell death, neuronal cell position, axo-dendritic projection patterns and many changes in synaptic connectivity of homologous neurons that display no obvious changes in overall neurite morphology and projection patterns. Differences in connectivity are distributed throughout the nervous system arguing against specific hot spots of evolutionary change and extend to differences in neuro/glia connectivity. We observed examples of apparent circuit drift, where changes in morphology and connectivity of a neuron do not appear to alter its behavioral output. In conclusion, our comprehensive comparison of distantly related nematode species provides novel vistas on patterns of conservation as well as the substrates of evolutionary change in the brain that span multiple organizational levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

These infections often manifest as vaginal discharge and can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Traditional antibiotic treatments are increasingly challenged by the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, underscoring the need for alternative therapies. This study aimed to isolate and identify microorganisms from vaginal swab samples and evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of clove (Eugenia caryophyllata) extracts against these isolates. Using CLED agar, nutrient agar, and Sabouraud dextrose agar, a diverse range of bacterial and fungal flora were isolated from eight vaginal swab samples. The primary bacterial isolates included Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus spp., while Candida albicans was the main fungal isolate. Biochemical tests confirmed the identity of these microorganisms. The study found that ethanol clove extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values being 20 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml, respectively. Additionally, ciprofloxacin, used as a control antibiotic, showed maximum inhibition against Lactobacillus spp., highlighting a potential risk for disrupting beneficial vaginal flora when using conventional antibiotics. The findings suggest that ethanol clove extract could serve as an effective alternative antimicrobial agent, reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance and preserving the balance of the vaginal microbiome. This research emphasizes the importance of exploring plant-based antimicrobial agents as viable alternatives to traditional antibiotics. The significant antimicrobial properties of clove extract against common vaginal pathogens offer promising implications for future therapeutic applications in managing vaginal infections.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

In particular, intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are subject to phosphorylation as a means to modulate their interactions and functions. Toward understanding the relationship between phosphorylation in IDRs and specific functional outcomes, we must consider how phosphorylation affects the IDR conformational ensemble. Various experimental techniques are suited to interrogate the features of IDR ensembles; molecular simulations can provide complementary insights and even illuminate ensemble features that may be experimentally inaccessible. Therefore, we sought to expand the tools available to study phosphorylated IDRs by all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. To this end, we implemented parameters for phosphoserine (pSer) and phosphothreonine (pThr) into the OPLS version of the continuum solvent model, ABSINTH, and assessed their performance in all-atom simulations compared to published findings. We simulated short (< 20 residues) and long (> 80 residues) phospho-IDRs that, collectively, survey both local and global phosphorylation-induced changes to the ensemble. Our simulations of four well-studied phospho-IDRs show near-quantitative agreement with published findings for these systems via metrics including changes to radius of gyration, transient helicity, and persistence length. We also leveraged the inherent advantage of sequence control in molecular simulations to explore the conformational effects of diverse combinations of phospho-sites in two multi-phosphorylated IDRs. Our results support and expand on prior observations that connect phosphorylation to changes in the IDR conformational ensemble. Herein, we describe phosphorylation as a means to alter sequence chemistry, net charge and charge patterning, and intramolecular interactions, which can collectively modulate the local and global IDR ensemble features.

SIGNIFICANCESpatially and temporally controlled phosphorylation in disordered protein regions is critical to many facets of protein function and broader cellular health. Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are overrepresented as targets of phosphorylation, but the structural and functional consequences of such modifications remain elusive for many systems. Toward rigorous modeling of phosphorylated IDRs using all-atom simulations, we present new parameters for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine for the ABSINTH implicit solvent paradigm. Through the study of four example phospho-IDRs, we demonstrate excellent agreement between our phospho-IDR simulations and published datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Mest homozygous knockout mice exhibit delayed bone regeneration though no phenotype is found in paternal knockout mice, inconsistent with the defined maternal genomic imprinting of Mest. We demonstrate that promoter switching, not loss of imprinting, regulates biallelic Mest expression in the blastema and does not occur during embryogenesis, indicating a regeneration-specific mechanism. Requirement for Mest expression is tied to modulating neutrophil response, as revealed by scRNAseq and FACS comparing wildtype and knockout blastemas. Collectively, the imprinted gene Mest is required for proper digit tip regeneration and its blastema expression is facilitated by promoter switching for biallelic expression.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Comparing the onset and brightness of expression of reporter alleles of C. elegans golg-4, encoding a broadly expressed Golgi resident protein, we found that the onset of detection of mScarlet-I3 in the embryo is several hours earlier than older versions of mScarlet and comparable to GFP. These findings were further supported by comparing mScarlet-I3 and GFP reporter alleles for pks-1, a gene expressed in the CAN neuron and cells of the alimentary system, as well as reporter alleles for the panneuronal, nuclear marker unc-75. Hence, the relative properties of mScarlet-I3 and GFP do not depend on cellular or subcellular context.

Despite their catalytic domains sharing over 90% sequence similarity, they preferentially methylate different flanking nucleotides adjacent to a classical CG motif. To uncover the basis of this selective methylation pattern, we conducted extensive molecular dynamics simulations of DNMT3A/B bound to eight possible CGX[C/G/T/A] motifs. Our comparative analysis of dynamic enzyme-DNA interactions revealed that single nucleotide substitutions in CGX motifs significantly alter DNMT3A-DNA hydrogen bonding profiles, resulting in a more specific readout for DNMT3A compared to DNMT3B. We found that +2 CGX nucleotide selectivity is driven by Arg/Lys-Guanine base-specific hydrogen bonds formed between DNMT3A/B and DNA. More specifically, Arg836 in DNMT3A reads the guanine complementary to C+2 in its cognate CGC motif, while Lys777 in DNMT3B recognizes two consecutive guanines in its cognate CGG. In DNMT3B, the impact of Arg-to-Lys mutation is mitigated through the cooperative nucleotide recognition directed by Asn779. All in all, our study provides fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DNA sequence selectivity in de novo DNA methylation at the atomistic scale, which will have direct implications in understanding other DNA sequence recognition mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

A multitude of evolutionary pressures, including the minimization of metabolic costs while maximizing communication efficiency, contribute to shaping the structure and dynamics of these networks. However, how communication efficiency is characterized depends on the assumed model of communication dynamics. Traditional models include shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Yet, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication remains to be established. Our study addresses this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through game theory, based on a combination of structural data from human cortical networks with computational models of brain dynamics. We quantified the exact influence exerted by each brain node over every other node using an exhaustive multi-site virtual lesioning scheme, creating optimal influence maps for various models of brain dynamics. These descriptions show how communication patterns unfold in the given brain network if regions maximize their influence over one another. By comparing these influence maps with a large variety of brain communication models, we found that optimal communication most closely resembles a broadcasting model in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we show that the most influential regions within the cortex are formed by its rich-club. These regions exploit their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways, thereby significantly enhancing their effective reach even when the anatomical connections are weak. Our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal communication across brain networks and reveals the most influential brain regions and the topological features underlying their optimal communication.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

However, several psychophysical studies found no compelling association between these illusions, calling this hypothesis into question. Here we ask if these discrepant reports could arise from methodological differences between these studies. We ran a battery of visual size illusion and basic discrimination tasks with carefully matched geometric properties, using a classical forced choice design. Ebbinghaus and Delboeuf illusion magnitudes are strongly correlated, consistent with the idea that they reflect the same underlying mechanism. Ponzo illusion magnitude also correlates with these two illusions, despite to a lesser extent, indicative that both shared and independent factors govern these illusions. Interestingly, the classical arrowhead version of the Mueller-Lyer illusion does not correlate with any of the other illusions or the ability to discriminate line length. This suggests that an altogether separate process underlies this perceptual effect. We further demonstrate that presenting stimuli briefly with central fixation critically affects measurements of the Ebbinghaus illusion. Taken together, our findings therefore highlight the importance of experimental parameters when probing relationships between perceptual effects and their links to neural processing.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

We conjecture that the competitive environment of a football game leads to movement dynamics reminiscent of that observed in hunter-gathering populations and more broadly in any biological organisms foraging for resources, whose exact distribution is unknown to them. Apart from analyzing individual players' movements, we investigate the dynamics of the whole team by studying the movements of its center of mass (team's centroid). Remarkably, the trajectory of the centroid also exhibits Levy walk properties, which implies the presence of team-level coordination.

Here, we investigate the performance of a wide range of PRS models across four ancestry groups (Africans, Europeans, East Asians, and South Asians) for 14 conditions of high-medical interest. Methods: To select the best-performing model per trait, we first compared PRS performances for publicly available scores, and constructed new models using different methods (LDpred2, PRS-CSx and SNPnet). We used 285K European individuals from the UK Biobank (UKBB) for training and 18K, including diverse ancestries, for testing. We then evaluated PRS portability for the best models in Europeans and compared their accuracies with respect to the best PRS per ancestry. Finally, we validated the selected PRS models using an independent set of 8,417 individuals from Biobank of the Americas-Genomelink (BBofA-GL); and performed a PRS-Phewas. Results: We confirmed a decay in PRS performances relative to Europeans when the evaluation was conducted using the best-PRS model for Europeans (51.3% for South Asians, 46.6% for East Asians and 39.4% for Africans). We observed an improvement in the PRS performances when specifically selecting ancestry specific PRS models (phenotype variance increase: 1.62 for Africans, 1.40 for South Asians and 0.96 for East Asians). Additionally, when we selected the optimal model conditional on ancestry for CAD, HDL-C and LDL-C, hypertension, hypothyroidism and T2D, PRS performance for studied populations was more comparable to what was observed in Europeans. Finally, we were able to independently validate tested models for Europeans, and conducted a PRS-Phewas, identifying cross-trait interplay between cardiometabolic conditions, and between immune-mediated components. Conclusion: Our work comprehensively evaluated PRS accuracy across a wide range of phenotypes, reducing the uncertainty with respect to which PRS model to choose and in which ancestry group. This evaluation has let us identify specific conditions where implementing risk-prioritization strategies could have practical utility across diverse ancestral groups, contributing to democratizing the implementation of PRS.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071428

We performed an array of (loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments, LC-MS/MS proteomics, X-ray diffraction) assays on vastus lateralis biopsies from diabetic patients and matched controls. Strikingly, our results highlight that the amount of muscle myosin molecules in SRX is higher and the related ATP demand lower in type II diabetes patients than in controls. These physiological changes are parallel with greater glycation levels on myosin heavy chains, and with remodelled sarcomeric proteins in the same type II diabetes patients. None of these (mal)adaptations were noticed in patients with type I diabetes.

To develop immunity, bacteria integrate spacers - fragments of the invading nucleic acids - into their CRISPR array to serve as the basis for sequence-targeted DNA cleavage. However, upon infection, phages quickly take over the metabolism of the bacteria, leaving little time for the bacteria to acquire new spacers, transcribe them and use them to cut the invading DNA. To develop CRISPR immunity, bacteria must be safely exposed to phage DNA. Phage infection releases eDNA which could be involved in the development of CRISPR immunity. Using S. thermophilus and phages 2972 and 858 as a model for CRISPR immunity, we show that eDNA is crucial to the development of optimal CRISPR immunity, as generation of phage-immune bacterial colonies decrease with eDNA digestion. Furthermore, it is phage eDNA specifically that impacts CRISPR immunity since its addition increases the generation of phage-immune colonies. We also show that the effect of eDNA is phage-specific, sequence specific and can even be traced to a region of the genome covering the early-expressed genes which differ between phages 2972 and 858. However, we also show that eDNA is not used as a source of genetic information for spacer acquisition. This suggests that the effect of eDNA involves a new mechanism of phage resistance. Moreover, the effect of eDNA is highly dependent on environmental conditions as variation in media suppliers are sufficient to interfere with this effect. These results link environmental conditions, specifically eDNA, to the CRISPR-Cas system, providing a better understanding of the context of the emergence of CRISPR immunity and could inform our understanding of the mechanisms through which bacteria detect the presence of phages before infection.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

The incomplete understanding of the molecular disease mechanisms results in lacking treatment options, leading to high mortality amongst patients. Here, using an inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific lamin A/C depletion mouse model, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic study, combining both bulk and single nucleus RNA sequencing, and spanning LMNA-DCM disease progression, to identify potential disease drivers. Our refined analysis pipeline identified 496 genes already misregulated early in disease. The expression of these genes was largely driven by disease specific cardiomyocyte sub-populations and involved biological processes mediating cellular response to DNA damage, cytosolic pattern recognition, and innate immunity. Indeed, DNA damage in LMNA-DCM hearts was significantly increased early in disease and correlated with reduced cardiomyocyte lamin A levels. Activation of cytosolic pattern recognition in cardiomyocytes was independent of cGAS, which is rarely expressed in cardiomyocytes, but likely occurred downstream of other pattern recognition sensors such as IFI16. Altered gene expression in cardiac fibroblasts and immune cell infiltration further contributed to tissue-wide changes in gene expression. Our transcriptomic analysis further predicted significant alterations in cell-cell communication between cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and immune cells, mediated through early changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the LMNA-DCM hearts. Taken together, our work suggests a model in which nuclear damage in cardiomyocytes leads to activation of DNA damage responses, cytosolic pattern recognition pathway, and other signaling pathways that activate inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and transcriptional changes in cardiac fibroblasts, which collectively drive LMNA-DCM pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Actin function is regulated in part by posttranslational modifications. One such modification in non-muscle cells is arginylation, in which an arginine residue is added to the N-terminus of {beta}-actin. What is the structure of arginylated {beta}-actin (R-{beta}-actin), are its interactions with other proteins altered and what phenotypes result when R-{beta}-actin is the sole actin isoform present in the cell? Here we report the 4.2 [A] structure of ADP-bound human R-{beta}-actin filaments, the overall structure of which is nearly identical to the filaments made of non-arginylated actin. In vitro functional assays using isoform-pure actins with defined post-translational modifications reveal that the interaction between myosin-II and actin is altered upon actin arginylation, due to frequent detachment of myosin-II from R-actin filaments. In vivo, we find that replacement of the only actin gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe with a synthetic gene encoding R-Sp-actin reduces Arp2/3-based actin patches while thickening the formin-induced actin. Furthermore, consistent with altered interactions between myosin-II and R-actin filaments, the assembly and constriction of cytokinetic actomyosin ring are perturbed in the R-Sp-actin cells. Thus, despite the overall structural similarity of arginylated and non-arginylated actin filaments, actin arginylation affects actin filament assortment into distinct subcellular structures and its interaction with myosin II.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Clinical grading of disease strongly predicts recurrence and survival after surgery and is determined by morphological assessment of histological growth patterns in resected tumours. The molecular basis of growth pattern is poorly understood at present, as are the mechanisms linking growth pattern to recurrence and death. Interestingly, the two archetypal lethal morphologies, solid and micropapillary patterns, are characterised by their biphasic appearance. Both have an epithelial fraction which is in direct stromal contact, and a fraction which is not. This morphological variance seems likely to represent plasticity, and to be causally linked to mechanisms of virulence. To investigate the gene expression changes related to growth pattern both intra- and inter-tumoral, we applied spatial transcriptomics (Nanostring GeoMx DSP) to tissue microarray specimens of primary resected human lung adenocarcinoma. Using a variety of region-of-interest (ROI) selection strategies, we sampled 160 pure epithelial ROIs across 7 distinct morphological features of LUAD from 51 patients. Analyses of gene expression reveal fundamental trajectories connecting growth patterns, and crucial modes of plasticity which underly high-risk morphologies. These modes suggest mechanisms for the origins of growth pattern and mechanisms of virulence. Our work highlights dramatic divergence in gene expression programmes between highly lethal but morphologically diverse modes of tumour growth. Furthermore, it provides an explanation for how microscopically localised hypoxia in the primary tumour helps to establish and maintain survival strategies which ultimately determine morphology-specific mechanisms of tumour metastasis, suggesting new therapeutic vulnerabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

In this study, we introduce isoLASER, a computational method leveraging long-read RNA-seq data to distinguish splicing events predominantly influenced by cis- or trans-regulatory mechanisms. IsoLASER computes the adjusted mutual information between haplotypes and exonic segments, and sensitively identifies allele-specific splicing events compared to transcript-level approaches. Using isoLASER, we identified 2,047 and 4,679 unique exonic regions exhibiting cis-directed splicing in human and mouse data respectively. Moreover, applied to a small number of samples jointly, isoLASER reveals splicing-associated variants that were only identifiable using large sample cohorts in previous association studies. Importantly, isoLASER enables HLA typing using long-read RNA-seq alone and uncovers allele-specific splicing of HLA genes. In brain tissues, we identified variants linked to splicing in Alzheimer`s disease-relevant genes such as MAPT, BIN1 and MS4A6A. Together, we establish a framework for identifying genetically and non-genetically driven splicing and associated variants, particularly in cohorts with limited sample sizes.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Combining Phollow with optically transparent zebrafish enabled us to directly visualize phage outbreaks within the vertebrate gut. We observed that virions can be rapidly taken up by intestinal tissues, including by enteroendocrine cells, and quickly disseminate to extraintestinal sites, including the liver and brain. Moreover, antibiotics trigger waves of interbacterial transmission leading to sudden shifts in spatial organization and composition of defined gut communities. Phollow ultimately empowers multiscale investigations connecting phage transmission to transkingdom interactions that have the potential to open new avenues for viral-based microbiome therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Four blood isolates, identified as Yersinia enterocolitica bioserotype 4/O:3, were further genetically and phenotypically characterized. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the patient was chronically infected by the same strain, which evolved within the host for 14 years. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis indicates that the last two isolates evolved in parallel and formed two independent lineages within the host. Pan-genome analysis and genome comparison showed that their common evolution was characterized by 41 small insertion/deletion events, loss of three large DNA fragments and mutations in 140 genes. A phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood identified two genes presenting a positive selection signal, suggesting that these mutations provided a survival advantage to bacteria during chronic infection. Quinolone resistance in the last two isolates was acquired through a so far undescribed deletion in the gyrA gene. Mass-spectrometry analysis revealed a strong proteome remodeling in the last two isolates which was correlated with a truncation in the stringent response regulator DksA. A reduced carbon, energy and purine metabolism supports their severe growth defects in vitro. 3rd-generation cephalosporin resistance of the last isolate was correlated with a truncation of OmpF, the main porin translocating antibiotics through the outer-membrane, as well as an increased production of BlaA and AmpC beta-lactamases.

Consequently, mutant plants lacking SBT5.2a activity retain higher levels of csp22, leading to enhanced immune responses and reduced pathogen growth. SBT5.2 sensitivity is influenced by sequence variation surrounding the cleavage site and likely extends to CSPs from other bacterial species.

Our work successfully recovers previously elusive segments, including complete reconstructions of the histone locus and the pericentric heterochromatin of the X chromosome, spanning the Stellate locus to the distal flank of the rDNA cluster. To infer structural changes in these regions where alignments are often not practicable, we introduce landmark anchors based on unique variants that are putatively orthologous. These regions display considerable structural variation between different D. melanogaster strains, exhibiting differences in copy number and organization of homologous repeat units between haplotypes. In the histone cluster, although we observe minimal genetic exchange indicative of crossing over, the variation patterns suggest mechanisms such as unequal sister chromatid exchange.

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), fast oscillations (sharp-wave ripples) during non-REM sleep consolidate spatial memories through place cell reactivation. The hippocampal formation is heterogeneous; the dHPC processes mostly contextual information, while the ventral part (vHPC) encodes valence and anxiety. We propose that dorsal-ventral communication during sleep is involved in the consolidation of emotional memories, potentially integrating or segregating contextual and valence information. To test this, we recorded the electrophysiological activity in the dHPC and vHPC in rats during reward and aversion-motivated exploration of a linear track and subsequent sleep. We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM sleep as well as neuronal assemblies during each exploration type and identified dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves coordinated ripples and bursts of ripples. Aversive joint assemblies exhibited higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint aversive assemblies reactivated selectively during dorso-ventral coordinated ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task. These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Microviruses are highly abundant in aquatic ecosystems and are prominent members of the mammalian gut microbiome, where their diversity has been linked to various chronic health disorders. Despite the clear importance of microviruses, little is known about the molecular mechanism of host infection. Here, we have characterized an exceptionally large microvirus, Ebor, and provide crucial insights into long-standing mechanistic questions. Cryogenic electron microscopy of Ebor revealed a capsid with trimeric protrusions that recognise lipopolysaccharides on the host surface. Cryogenic electron tomography of the host cell colonized with virus particles demonstrated that the virus initially attaches to the cell via five such protrusions, located at the corners of a single pentamer. This interaction triggers a stargate mechanism of capsid opening along the 5-fold symmetry axis, enabling delivery of the virus genome. Despite variations in specific virus-host interactions among different Microviridae family viruses, structural data indicate that the stargate mechanism of infection is universally employed by all members of the family. Startlingly, our data reveal a mechanistic link for the opening of relatively small capsids made out of a single jelly-roll fold with the structurally unrelated giant viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Advances in artificial intelligence and infection modelling have enabled ICT teams to better predict and trace infection spread.

In this work, we sought to develop Galleria mellonella as a model organism to replicate the dissemination of pathogens in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU). By combining this model organism with 3D printed models of a real hospital ICU, we are able to demonstrate that larvae do disseminate the multidrug resistant pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii within this ICU model and that it is possible to use this model to identify infection hotspots. Importantly, this model can also be used for intervention strategy testing as we also show that bacterial dissemination can be significantly mitigated by the introduction of antimicrobial wall surface coatings. This model provides a robust platform for the testing of antimicrobial surface coatings as well as the study of genetic determinants with a role in pathogen dissemination.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

To emulate the complex chemical systems in biological cells, it is necessary to incorporate an increasing number of cellular functions into single compartments. Artificial organelles that spatially segregate reactions inside artificial cells will be beneficial in this context by rectifying biochemical pathways. In our study, we developed artificial cells featuring all-aqueous droplet-in-droplet structures that separate transcription and translation processes, mimicking the nucleus and cytosol in eukaryotic cells. This droplet-in-droplet architecture utilizes intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) to form coacervate droplets for the inner compartments, and aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) for the outer compartments, with the outer interfaces stabilized by colloidal emulsifiers. The inner droplet was designed to enrich DNA and RNA polymerase to conduct transcription, which was coupled to translation at the outer droplet, realizing the cascade reaction mediated by mRNA. We also demonstrate that these processes proceed independently within each artificial cell compartment, maintaining the correspondence between genotype and phenotype. The modular configuration of these artificial organelles could be extended to other enzymatic reactions. Coupled with the ease of manufacturing these artificial cells, which only requires simple agitation in an all-aqueous mixture, this approach provides a practical and accessible tool for exploring complex systems of artificial organelles within large ensembles of artificial cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Over the past decade, zoonotic transmission to mammals, including humans, has been reported. Although human to human transmission is rare, infection has been fatal in nearly half of patients who have contracted the virus in past outbreaks. The increasing presence of the virus in domesticated animals raises substantial concerns that viral adaptation to immunologically naive humans may result in the next flu pandemic. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to track viruses was historically used to track polio and has recently been implemented for SARS-CoV2 monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, using an agnostic, hybrid-capture sequencing approach, we report the detection of H5N1 in wastewater in nine Texas cities, with a total catchment area population in the millions, over a two-month period from March 4th to April 25th, 2024. Sequencing reads uniquely aligning to H5N1 covered all eight genome segments, with best alignments to clade 2.3.4.4b. Notably, 19 of 23 monitored sites had at least one detection event, and the H5N1 serotype became dominant over seasonal influenza over time.

This suggests a critical need to model the interaction between sensory feedback and intrinsic dynamics. Such models would also benefit the design of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode neural activity in real time, where both user learning and proficient control require feedback. Here we investigate the flexible feedback modulation of cortical dynamics and demonstrate its impact on BCI task performance and short-term learning. By training recurrent network models with real-time sensory feedback on a simple 2D reaching task, analogous to BCI cursor control, we show how previously reported M1 activity patterns can be reinterpreted as arising from feedback-driven dynamics. Next, by incorporating adaptive controllers upstream of M1, we make a testable prediction that short-term learning for a new BCI decoder is facilitated by plasticity of inputs to M1, including remapping of sensory feedback, beyond the plasticity of recurrent connections within M1. This input-driven dynamical structure also determines the speed of adaptation and learning outcomes, and explains a continuous form of learning variability. Thus, our work highlights the need to model input-dependent latent dynamics for motor control and clarifies how constraints on learning arise from both the statistical characteristics and the underlying dynamical structure of neural activity.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Our simulations propose host-microbial and microbial-microbial interactions that can be verified based on the literature. Most importantly, the Virtual Colon offers visualisation of interactions through time and space, adding another dimension to the genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches.

Erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments often form during early mitosis, but are destabilized through the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins by centromeric AURORA B kinase (ABK) and centrosomal AURORA A kinase (AAK), thus allowing for re-establishment of attachments until biorientation is achieved. MPS1-mediated phosphorylation of NDC80 has also been shown to directly weaken the kinetochore-microtubule interface in yeast. In human cells, MPS1 has been proposed to transiently accumulate at end-on attached kinetochores and phosphorylate SKA3 to promote microtubule release. Whether MPS1 directly targets NDC80 and/or promotes the activity of AURORA kinases in metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism involving communication between kinetochores and centrosomes, wherein MPS1 acts upstream of AAK to promote error correction. MPS1 on pole-proximal kinetochores phosphorylates the C-lobe of AAK thereby increasing its activation at centrosomes. This proximity-based activation ensures the establishment of a robust AAK activity gradient that locally destabilizes mal-oriented kinetochores near spindle poles. Accordingly, MPS1 depletion from Drosophila cells causes severe chromosome mis-alignment and erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which can be rescued by tethering either MPS1 or constitutively active AAK mutants to centrosomes. Proximity-based activation of AAK by MPS1 also occurs in human cells to promote AAK-mediated phosphorylation of the NDC80 N-terminal tail. These findings uncover an MPS1-AAK cross-talk that is required for efficient error correction, showcasing the ability of kinetochores to modulate centrosome outputs to ensure proper chromosome segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

The explicit bias was introduced by informing participants about stimulus probability on a single-trial level (volatile context) or block-wise (stable context). Behavioural analysis confirmed adjustments in the decision criterion and confidence ratings according to the cued probabilities and previous choice-induced biases. Pre-stimulus beta power with distinct sources in sensory and higher-order cortical areas predicted explicit and implicit biases, respectively, on a single subject level and partially mediated the impact of previous choice and stimulus probability on the detection response.

We find that physiologically relevant and disease-associated repeat RNAs spontaneously undergo an age-dependent percolation transition inside multi-component protein-nucleic acid condensates to form nanoscale clusters. Homotypic RNA clusters drive the emergence of multiphasic condensate structures with an RNA-rich solid core surrounded by an RNA-depleted fluid shell. The timescale of the RNA clustering, which drives a liquid-to-solid transition of biomolecular condensates, is determined by the sequence features, stability of RNA secondary structure, and repeat length. Importantly, G3BP1, the core scaffold of stress granules, introduces heterotypic buffering to homotypic RNA-RNA interactions and impedes intra-condensate RNA clustering in an ATP-independent manner.

In addition, we observe that a pool of the Rab-specific, PPM1H phosphatase, is transcriptionally up-regulated and recruited to damaged mitochondria, independent of PINK1 or LRRK2 activity. Parallel signalling of LRRK2 and PINK1 pathways is supported by assessment of motor behavioural studies that show no evidence of genetic interaction in crossed mouse lines. Previously we showed loss of cilia in LRRK2 R1441C mice and herein we show that PINK1 KO mice exhibit a ciliogenesis defect in striatal cholinergic interneurons and astrocytes that interferes with Hedgehog induction of glial derived-neurotrophic factor (GDNF) transcription. This is not exacerbated in double mutant LRRK2 and PINK1 mice.

In contrast, VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely signaled a less behaviorally-preferred sucrose reward compared with fat. Further experiments suggested that VGluT2+VGaT+ consummatory reward-related activity was related to sweetness, partially modulated by hunger state, and not dependent on caloric content or behavioral preference. All VGluT2+ subtypes increased neuronal activity following aversive stimuli but VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons uniquely scaled their magnitude and sustained activity with footshock intensity. Optogenetic activation of VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons during low intensity footshock enhanced fear-related behavior without inducing place preference or aversion.

The ACC may achieve this by integrating reward information over time to estimate which objects are worth to explore and which objects should be avoided. Such a higher-order meta-awareness about which objects should be explored predicts that the ACC causally contributes to choices when the reward values of objects are unknown and must be inferred from ongoing exploration. We tested this suggestion in nonhuman primates using a learning task that varied the number of object features that could be relevant, and by controlling the motivational value of choosing objects. During learning the ACC was transiently micro-stimulated when subjects foveated the to-be-chosen stimulus. We found that stimulation selectively impaired learning when feature uncertainty and motivational value of choices were high, which was linked to a deficit in using reward outcomes for feature-specific credit assignment. Application of an adaptive reinforcement learning model confirmed a primary deficit in weighting prediction errors that led to a meta-learning impairment to adaptively increase exploration during learning and to an impaired use of working memory to support learning. These findings provide causal evidence that the reward history traces in ACC are essential for meta-adjusting the exploration-exploitation balance and the strength of working memory of object values during adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

We further demonstrate that fluorescein-conjugated extracellular matrix (ECM)-binding peptides can regulate SynNotch activity depending on the folding state of collagen-based ECM networks. Treatment with these conjugates enabled cells to distinguish between folded versus denatured collagen proteins and enact dose-dependent gene expression responses depending on the nature of the signaling adaptors presented. To demonstrate the utility of these tools, we applied them to control the myogenic conversion of fibroblasts into myocytes with spatial and temporal precision and in response to denatured collagen-I, a biomarker of multiple pathological states.

(GAA)n repeat expansions are responsible for Friedreich's ataxia as well as late-onset cerebellar ataxias (LOCAs). Thus, the mechanisms of (GAA)n repeat expansions attract broad scientific attention. To investigate the role of DNA nicks in this process, we utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 nickase system to introduce targeted nicks adjacent to the (GAA)n repeat tract. We found that DNA nicks 5' of the (GAA)100 run led to a dramatic increase in both the rate and scale of its expansion in dividing cells. Strikingly, they also promoted large-scale expansions of carrier- and large normal-size (GAA)n repeats, recreating, for the first time in a model system, the expansion events that occur in human pedigrees. DNA nicks 3' of the (GAA)100 repeat led to a smaller but significant increase in the expansion rate as well. Our genetic analysis implies that in dividing cells, conversion of nicks into double-strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication followed by DSB or fork repair leads to repeat expansions. Finally, we showed that 5' strand nicks increase expansion frequency in non-dividing yeast cells, albeit to a lesser extent that in dividing cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1718489071428

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

Growing evidence supports a likely causal association between cardiovascular diseases and the presence of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), a cellular transdifferentiation process in which endothelial cells (ECs) partially lose their identity and acquire additional mesenchymal phenotypes. EC reprogramming represents an innovative strategy in regenerative medicine to prevent deleterious effects induced by cardiovascular diseases.

MethodsUsing a partial reprogramming of ECs, via overexpression of Oct-3/4, Sox-2, and Klf-4 (OSK) transcription factors, we aimed to bring ECs back to a youthful phenotype in hypertensive mice. Primary ECs were infected with lentiviral vectors (LV) containing the specific EC marker cadherin 5 (Cdh5) and the fluorescent reporter enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) with empty vector (LVCO) or with OSK (LV-OSK). Confocal microscopy and western blotting analysis were used to confirm the OSK overexpression. Cellular migration, senescence, and apoptosis were evaluated. Human aortic ECs (HAoECs) from male and female normotensive and hypertensive patients were analyzed after OSK or control treatments for their endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels, nitric oxide (NO), and genetic profile. Male and female normotensive (BPN/3J) and hypertensive (BPH/2J) mice were treated with an intravenous (i.v.) injection of LVCO or LV-OSK and evaluated 10 days post-infection. The blood pressure, cardiac function, vascular reactivity of small arteries, in vivo EGFP signal and EndMT inhibition were analyzed.

ResultsOSK overexpression induced partial EC reprogramming in vitro, and these cells showed endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-like features with lower migratory capability. OSK treatment of hypertensive BPH/2J mice normalized blood pressure and resistance arteries hypercontractility, via the attenuation of EndMT and elastin breaks. EGFP signal was detected in vivo in the prefrontal cortex of both BPN/3J and BPH/2J-treated mice, but OSK induced angiogenesis only in male BPN/3J mice. OSK-treated human ECs from hypertensive patients showed high eNOS activation and NO production, with low ROS formation. Single-cell RNA analysis showed that OSK alleviated EC senescence and EndMT, restoring their phenotypes in human ECs from hypertensive patients.

ConclusionOverall, these data indicate that OSK treatment and EC reprogramming can decrease blood pressure and reverse hypertension-induced vascular damage.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

Here, we report the detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle herds across several states in the U.S. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered fecal consistency, respiratory distress, and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and RNA were consistently detected in milk collected from affected cows. Viral staining in tissues revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Analysis of whole genome sequences obtained from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats, and a racoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiologic and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state.

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718489071428

DesignDescriptive network cohort study.

SettingElectronic health records from UK and Dutch primary care, Norwegian linked health registry, hospital records of specialist centres in Spain, France, and Korea, and healthcare claims from Estonia and the US.

ParticipantsWe followed individuals between September 2020 and the latest available data from the day they fulfilled at least 365 days of prior observation (general population), additionally from day 91 after a SARS-Cov-2 negative test (comparator) or a COVID-19 record (exposed patients).

Main outcome measuresWe assessed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) diagnoses/symptoms, myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnoses/symptoms, multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and several autoimmune diseases. For contextualisation, we assessed any diabetes mellitus (DM).

Meta-analysed crude incidence rate ratios (IRR) of outcomes measures after COVID-19 versus negative testing yield the ratios of absolute risks. Furthermore, incidence rates (IR) of the outcomes in the general population describe the total disease burden.

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.
