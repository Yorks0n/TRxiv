MethodsThe study includes pregnancies in Israel with last menstruation period (LMP) between March 1, 2016 and February 28, 2022. The main analysis presents observed-to-expected comparisons of the number of eventual fetal losses among pregnant women exposed to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (almost all Pfizer) during gestational weeks 8-13 and 14-27, respectively. Women vaccinated for influenza during gestational weeks 8-27, as well as women vaccinated prior to pregnancy for COVID-19 or influenza, were used as comparative controls. Cohort-specific expected number of fetal losses are established based on estimates from a regression model trained on historical data from 2016-2018 that incorporates individual-level risk factors and gestational week of each pregnant woman included in the cohort.

ResultsAnalysis of 226,395 singleton pregnancies in Israel from 2016 to 2022 indicates that COVID-19 vaccination with dose 1 during weeks 8-13 was associated with higher-than-expected observed number of fetal losses of approximately 13 versus 9 expected for every 100 exposed pregnancies, i.e., nearly 3.9 (95% CI: [2.55-5.14]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies Most of the excess fetal losses occurred after gestational week 20 and nearly half occurred after gestational week 25. Similarly, women vaccinated with dose 3 during weeks 8-13 exhibited a higher-than-expected number of fetal losses with nearly 1.9 (95% CI: 0.39-3.42]) additional fetal losses above expected per 100 pregnancies. In contrast, pregnant women vaccinated for influenza during weeks 8-27 exhibited a consistently lower-than-expected observed number of fetal losses, likely the result of healthy vaccinee bias. Women vaccinated for COVID-19 or influenza prior to pregnancy exhibited according-to-expected or lower-than-expected numbers of fetal losses.

ConclusionThe results provide evidence for a substantially higher-than-expected number of eventual fetal losses associated with COVID-19 vaccination during gestational weeks 8-13.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides. Our results show that Siglec-6 relies only partially on its conserved Arg (Arg122) for recognition of membrane-bound gangliosides and that it supplements its binding free energy through interactions with the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding the target epitope. We identified residues Lys126 and Trp127 as key players in this unique membrane interaction, and we confirmed by mutagenesis assays that the loss of these residues abrogates binding. These results provide a step-change in our understanding of the diversification of human Siglecs across group 2, where different members likely evolved as molecular precision tools, to bind specific sialosides by adapting their structure to recognize not only the epitope, but also the biological environment in which it is found.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

ObjectiveTo assess the transportability of findings from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to real-world populations in the United States (US), Germany and France.

DesignThis empirical validation study used patient-level data from the RCT Lung-MAP S1400I to build a transportability model to adjust for differences in patient characteristics from real-world target patient populations. Two sets of adjustments were performed - one limited to the set of measured clinical variables, and the second additionally including external information drawn from published literature and substantive knowledge on patient subgroups excluded from the trial. The latter enabled transportability to a significantly more diverse and representative real-world patient population by relaxing the stringent exclusion criteria used in Lung-MAP S1400I. For benchmarking, we compared how well the transportability analysis approximated observed overall survival in the respective real-world cohorts.

SettingObservational study.

ParticipantsEligible individuals diagnosed with advanced or metastatic NSCLC and previously treated with systemic therapy.

Intervention/exposureNivolumab monotherapy.

Main outcome measuresOverall survival.

ResultsSample size for the nivolumab arm in Lung-MAP S1400I was 127 and ranged from 133 to 1051 for the various real-world cohorts included. Patients with ECOG scores of 2+, index cancer stage <IV, presence of ALK/EGFR mutations, presence of comorbidities and prior exposure to immunotherapy/targeted therapies were excluded from Lung-MAP S1400I, were but were eligible to receive nivolumab monotherapy in real-world care. Adjusting for measured clinical differences improved alignment of patient outcomes in the RCT and the real-world cohorts. However, only when variables related to excluded patient groups were also addressed did the results fully satisfy control conditions, yielding the closest approximation to real-world survival in the US, Germany, and France (mean discrepancy: 0.27 months over [~]30 months).

ConclusionsOverall survival in a more diverse real-world patient population could be extrapolated using data from the Lung-MAP S1400I trial when complemented with external information about excluded patient groups.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Evidence from genetic association studies, animal models, and clinical investigation suggests a neuroimmunological component to disease, with links to the peripheral immune system. Here we applied a systems immunology approach to determine the immunological correlates of Alzheimers disease. Using high-dimensional flow cytometry and machine learning, we comprehensively assessed the cellular component of the peripheral immune system in a well-characterised cohort of 184 Alzheimers patients and 105 healthy spouses. Using this approach, Alzheimers patients demonstrated a disturbance in B cell maturation, a feature which was associated not only with disease status but also with cognitive decline. This effect was age- and environmental exposure-independent, suggesting a disease-intrinsic relationship between Alzheimers disease and B cell maturation. These results provide an under-explored avenue for both improving both mechanistic understanding and therapeutic design in Alzheimers disease.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

The largest previous genetic studies of measures of intelligence have used [~]270k individuals who completed the fluid intelligence (FI) test in UK Biobank. Here, we integrate additional FI measures in this cohort and leverage eighty-two correlated variables to impute FI values for unmeasured individuals, increasing the sample size to >450k. Through population-based and within-family genome-wide association studies and downstream analyses, we show that this imputation produces a phenotype that genetically resembles measured FI and reduces ascertainment bias within the cohort. We further show that combining measured and imputed FI scores increases the number of independent SNP associations (p<5x10-8) from 385 to 608 and increases polygenic score accuracy in external cohorts by 15% on average. Additionally, incorporating imputed FI scores increases the number of gene-level associations with rare variants from five to twenty-six (FDR<1%). These include fourteen well-established developmental disorder-associated genes, a four-fold enrichment (p=8x10-8); for several of these, our results suggest that loss-of-function variants in the gene impact neurodevelopment, in addition to the previously documented altered-function variants. We also implicate twelve genes without strong prior evidence of association developmental disorders, of which eight have not been previously linked to intelligence (ROBO2, RB1CC1, ANK3, CHD9, TLK1, PCLO, DPP8, IPO9). These twelve genes were significantly enriched for de novo loss-of-function mutations in a set of >31k patients with developmental disorders (p=6.8x10-4). We further identify three genes showing significant rare variant associations with educational attainment but not with FI, including CADPS2 in which, unusually, protein-truncating variants show a positive association. Our results demonstrate the power of phenotype imputation for genetic studies and suggest that incorporating genetic association results for cognitive phenotypes in the general population could help discover new developmental disorder genes.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

The limit of detection for recombinant antigens was 0.67 pg/ml, and inactivated whole virus wild-type and Omicron variants were 13 TCID50/mL and 8.8 TCID50/mL, respectively. Our blinded clinical study with 103 patient upper respiratory tract swab samples showed 95.1% sensitivity (Ct [&le;] 30) and 100% specificity benchmarked to RT-qPCR, with no cross-reactivity to influenza A, RSV, and Rhinovirus.

Quantum-enhanced LFT sensitivity would have detected [~]69,400 more patients in a single day at the peak of Omicron, reducing the transmission risk and protecting populations.

A cohesive theory of the underlying mechanisms of the Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) remains unknown, primarily due to high variability in findings across independent studies. Here, we present a multimodal, cross-sectional MRI analysis of brain morphology (T1-MRI), tissue microstructure (diffusion-MRI), functional connectivity (functional-MRI), and cerebral blood flow (Arterial Spin Labeling MRI) in COVID-Recovered Patients (CRPs, N=76) and Healthy Controls (HCs, N=51). Although the global brain volumes did not differ between the two groups, CRPs showed focal atrophy in the right basal ganglia and limbic structures, along with cortical thinning in paralimbic regions (prefrontal cortex, insula) (p<0.05). Diffusion MRI analysis revealed reduced fractional anisotropy and elevated radial diffusivity in the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum. No differences were observed in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cerebral blood flow between HCs and CRPs (p>0.05). We further investigated the effect of infection severity by stratifying the CRPs into hospitalized (HP; N = 21) and non-hospitalized (NHP; N = 46) groups. The microstructural damage was linked to infection severity, more pronounced in the HPs (p<0.05). In HPs, RSFC was diminished between components of the default mode network and the insula and caudate as compared to HCs and NHPs (p<0.05). Results suggest COVID-19 is associated with selective structural and functional alterations in basal ganglia-limbic-cortical circuits, with stronger effects in severe cases. Our findings are in line with common prevalent behavioral symptoms such as fatigue, memory impairment, attentional deficits, and insomnia. This study suggests that localized microstructural neuroinflammatory mechanisms contribute to post-COVID neurological symptoms and offers potential imaging biomarkers for targeted therapies and monitoring recovery.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

We quantify the occupancy of LSD at cerebral serotonin 2A receptors and show that LSD increases global cerebral blood flow and internal carotid artery flow without affecting the diameter of the internal carotid artery, opposite effects to those observed following psilocybin. Functional connectivity analyses showed widespread decreases in global connectivity, particularly in visual networks, alongside increases in network-wise sample entropy and spatial complexity. We observed an anticlockwise hysteresis loop between plasma drug levels and subjective effects, suggesting atypical pharmacodynamic mechanisms. By establishing the dose-occupancy relation of LSD in humans, our findings provide critical insights for the clinical development of psychedelic compounds and demonstrate unique neurophysiological effects that distinguish LSD from related psychedelics.

This is particularly relevant when modifying complex molecular machines that transition between numerous conformational states. Here, we address this issue by developing SIMPLIFE, a computational workflow that supports the design of optimal insertion sites for conjugation tags based on the structure of the proteins involved and performs localised residue redesign where needed. We demonstrate how SIMPLIFE can be used to effectively augment the function of T7 RNA polymerase using the DogCatcher-DogTag system, enabling diverse and dynamically varying mutations within a targeted region of DNA.

However, it is not well understood whether personal light exposure patterns predicts and individuals risk of cardiovascular diseases.

ObjectiveTo assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases, and whether relationships of light with cardiovascular diseases differ according to genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.

DesignProspective cohort study.

SettingUnited Kingdom.

ParticipantsN=88,905, age (M{+/-}SD) = 62.4{+/-}7.8 years, 56.9% female.

ExposureApproximately 13 million hours of personal light exposure data, tracked by wrist-worn light sensors (one week each).

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, derived from UK National Health Service records, across a 9.5-year follow-up after light tracking.

ResultsPeople with the brightest nights (90-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks of developing coronary artery disease (adjusted-HR range: 1.23-1.32), myocardial infarction (aHRs: 1.42-1.47), heart failure (aHRs: 1.45-1.56), atrial fibrillation (aHRs: 1.28-1.32), and stroke (aHRs: 1.28-1.30), compared to people with dark nights (0-50th percentiles). These relationships were robust after adjusting for established risk factors for cardiovascular health, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and polygenic risk. Relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease were stronger for women, and relationships of night light with risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation were stronger for younger individuals in this cohort.

Conclusions and RelevanceNight light exposure was a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases in this cohort. In addition to current preventative measures, avoiding light at night may be a useful strategy for reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases.

Key Points

QuestionDoes personal light exposure predict incidence of cardiovascular diseases?

FindingsIn this study of [~]89,000 adults aged >40 years, exposure to brighter light at night predicted higher incidence of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke, independent of established cardiovascular risk factors.

MeaningAvoiding exposure to night light may lower risk for cardiovascular diseases.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Three serious adverse events were reported, all unrelated to the study products. No between group differences were observed in secondary endpoints.

LimitationThe results may not be generalizable to individuals newly experiencing PCC.

ConclusionPycnogenol(R) (200 mg daily) did not improve health status compared to placebo over 12 weeks in PCC. Both groups showed clinically relevant improvements, suggesting non-therapeutic effects.

Noncoding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at hundreds of loci have been linked to ND risk by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but the causal genes and pathways are largely unknown. Despite the multicellular pathology of complex traits like multiple sclerosis (MS), functional studies that aim to characterize the molecular impact of disease-associated SNPs often investigate all SNPs linked to disease in the same cellular context. Here, we combine a computational approach to predict the pathogenic cell type of individual risk loci with functional CRISPR perturbation studies in iPSC-derived microglia cells (iMGLs). ND SNP enrichment in cell type-specific enhancers is similar between primary and iPSC-derived cells, and mechanistically supported by shared enhancer-promoter interactions. We apply a novel Perturb-seq platform to interrogate MS risk SNPs in iMGL, identifying likely cis-acting causal risk genes at 5 of 9 loci, as well as downstream differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Despite being found in trans to MS risk SNPs, downstream DEGs are substantially enriched for MS heritability. Downstream DEGs from all 5 target genes show significant overlap, converging on genes related to cytokinesis, phagocytosis, and mitochondrial metabolism. We then compared downstream DEGs to gene expression patterns observed in MS patient tissue studies and observed marked similarities, demonstrating that genes dysregulated as the result of GWAS loci perturbation mirrored effects observed in microglia found in MS patient lesions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that cell type aware functional studies can be used to translate ND SNP associations into mechanistic insights and reveal novel convergent biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Methods Three weeks after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, non-hospitalized adult participants enrolled in the COVID HOME study consented to complete a questionnaire by phone on the presence, characteristics, and impact on daily life and QoL of olfactory, gustatory and/or trigeminal changes. Participants reporting taste and/or smell changes completed the same questionnaire at three months and, when still present, at six months. Results The questionnaire was completed by 94/117 participants included in this study three weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. The 43 participants with smell and/or taste changes completed the questionnaire at three months, and 19 at six months. Of the 94 participants, 56% were female and the median age was 43 [IQR 29-55] years. At three weeks post-infection, olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal changes were reported by 40 (43%), 37 (39%), and 8 (9%) participants, respectively.

However, in humans, corresponding changes in dopamine-dependent behavior, such as reward learning with increasing BMI, have not been conclusively established and dissociated from pathological eating behavior. Here, we provide a principled assessment of differences in reinforcement learning (RL) related to obesity or pathological eating, such as binge eating (BE), using a large sample of 370 participants enriched for high BMI and BE. To dissociate trait and state components of RL, participants completed up to 31 runs of a novel RL game across weeks (1,486,950 observed choices). We used hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate the mean and variability of parameters for each individual. Across runs, higher BMI was predicted by higher and more variable learning rates using elastic net models ({Delta}R2=.19; pperm<.0001) although performance did not differ (r=-0.04, pboot=.46). In contrast, BE and the dimension loss of control were characterized by lower and more variable reward sensitivity ({Delta}R2=.19, controlled for BMI; pperm<.0001) leading to fewer points (r=.10, pboot=.030). Crucially, patients with BE disorder also showed attenuated reward sensitivity in the nucleus accumbens during anticipation in an effort task that required no learning (p=.006). We conclude that obesity-related differences in reward learning are best explained by changes in learning, whereas BE and loss of control were mostly driven by reduced reward sensitivity. Notably, repeated assessments revealed that increased variability across states contribute to both obesity and BE. Our findings highlight the necessity to complement neurobiological research with behavioral precision mapping to derive mechanistic insight into multidimensional disorders such as obesity and BE disorder.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

However, it is currently unknown what molecular changes are induced by the surgery, how they relate to the health improvements, how early they occur, and whether they are maintained over time. In this study, we characterized early gene expression changes following surgery in blood samples from the ""Personalised Medicine for Morbid Obesity"" cohort. We observed widespread changes in gene expression only a few days after surgery. Pathways related to immune response were affected, in particular with a decreased expression of the NF-{kappa}B pathway and neutrophil cytotoxic activity genes, suggesting a reduction of the inflammatory state typically associated with obesity. Metabolic signaling was also affected, with decreased expression of genes from pathways related to glucagon and insulin secretion, and key regulators such as the appetite-controlling hormone ghrelin. Comparisons to publicly available transcriptomics datasets showed that beyond these specific changes, bariatric surgery induces a transcriptome-wide reversal of expression changes associated with obesity and with forms of type 2 diabetes related to obesity. Comparisons to transcriptomics studies with longer-term follow-ups after bariatric surgery showed that a large fraction of early-induced expression changes likely persist for several months. Taken together, we show that previously unreported early changes in blood gene expression after bariatric surgery provide in-depth insights into the resolution of the chronic inflammation associated with severe obesity and its connection with metabolic improvement.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Age of natural menopause (ANM) and reproductive lifespan is determined by the formation and subsequent depletion of follicles in females. In this study, we identified a robust association between a common functional missense variant in PARP1 and age at menopause in a sample of 201,323 women. Using an in vitro model to generate primordial germ cells - the precursors of sperm and oocytes- we report that Parp1 affects PGCs in two different ways. Our identified missense variant (V762A) significantly reduces the germ cell population by enhanced DNA binding resulting in increased apoptosis. Conversely, deletion of Parp1 results in an increased population of PGCs and proteomic analysis revealed that transcription factors that drive PGC formation show increased expression in precursor cells. This is caused by increased transcription of Rhox genes (Rhox2A, Rhox6 and Rhox9), implicating Parp1 in downregulation of genes that determine PGC fate. We propose that Parp1 regulates PGC fate and that its increased chromatin association ( trapping) causes a decreased population of PGCs, thereby providing a molecular cause of the earlier onset menopause on female carriers of the variant.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

Multi-omic profiling revealed in situ phage replication, transient suppression of non- mucoid P. aeruginosa, and virome restructuring. Bacterial isolates evolved resistance with associated fitness costs, while the host developed phage-specific neutralizing antibodies that limited systemic activity.

Here, we identify mislocalization of the RNA-binding protein FUS in cortical neurons as a defining feature in ALS patients with cognitive impairment (ALS-ci). Selective mislocalization of FUS in adult cortical projection neurons in mice is sufficient to trigger ALS-ci- and ALS with behavioral impairment (ALS-bi)-like phenotypes, including deficits in sociability, and neurodegeneration. Single-nucleus transcriptomics reveal a conserved FUS-dependent gene network downregulated in these mice and ALS-ci patients. This regulon is enriched for ALS genetic risk factors and newly implicates FBXO16 in ALS-bi. Carriers of protein-truncating FBXO16 variants display behavioral abnormalities, frontotemporal atrophy, and increased levels of dementia-linked biomarkers. These findings define a neuron-intrinsic mechanism for cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in ALS and nominate FUS mislocalization and its downstream gene network as therapeutic targets.

To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we commercially obtained synthetic DNA fragments containing locus-specific homology regions, antibiotic marker cassettes, and standardized Cas9 target sequences. By using these locus-specific synthetic DNA fragments, we relocated 7 functional chromosomal loci. Scarless relocation mutants of the trg, aer, tsr, malHM, malQT, macB-nadA, and folA chromosomal loci were obtained as antibiotic-resistant isolates by combining Cas9 counterselection with the restoration of an antibiotic marker cassette. The additional antibiotic marker cassettes and standardized Cas9 target sequences present in the synthetic DNA fragments are inherently eliminated upon completion of the procedure, enabling iterative processing of loci. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome (re-)engineering of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done on wild-type cells.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the prevalence of chronic pain among active-duty Service members is 1.5 to 2 times higher than the 20% of American adults who live with chronic pain. Recent report findings determined that Service members make up a large population within the Military Health Systems (MHS), and that this population is disproportionately affected by lost duty days, early retirement, loss of readiness, and increased burden to the MHS. To date, the Department of Defense (DOD) and MHS have emphasized multimodal, multidisciplinary, stepped treatment for chronic pain that prioritizes nonpharmacologic therapies and non-opioid pain medications. Though the DOD and MHS have invested in several pain treatment types, our level of understanding needs to better distinguish between acute and chronic pain and identify risk factors and mechanisms responsible for the chronification of pain, as it is the chronic pain which compromises functioning and readiness to a greater degree across the force. The novel information generated by this study will enhance our understanding of how ankle fracture elicits pathological risk factors for bone fracture associated neuropathic pain (BFNP), which ultimately impairs health-related quality of life. Due to the high prevalence of ankle fractures and the subsequent risk of developing chronic pain after ankle fracture, we will utilize this patient population to provide the preliminary evidence on whether bone fracture and subsequent BFNP phenotypes are reflected in specific genetic profiles and activated states of immune cells.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Between 1990 and 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) increased while the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) decreased. Regionally, Southern Latin America exhibited the highest ASRs. Nationally, Monaco ranked highest in ASIR and ASPR, while Mexico had the highest ASMR and ASDR. Population growth and epidemiological changes were major drivers for the burden of DALYs in middle SDI regions, which had the greatest potential for improvement. Conclusions: The global burden of TC among AYA has risen, which is most pronounced in middle SDI regions. Among the AYA population, TC survivors have increased significantly due to the decreased ASMR and ASDR, who badly need more attention for TC treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

To address this, we present LucaVirus, a unified, multi-modal foundation model specifically designed for viruses. Trained on 25.4 billion nucleotide and amino acid tokens encompassing nearly all known viruses, LucaVirus learns biologically meaningful representations that capture the relationships between nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein/gene homology, and evolutionary divergence. Building on these interpretable embeddings, we developed specialized downstream models to address key challenges in virology: (i) identify viruses hidden within genomic ""dark matter"", (ii) characterize enzymatic activities of unknown proteins, (iii) predict viral evolvability, and (iv) discover antibody drugs for emerging viruses. LucaVirus achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks (i), (iii), and (iv), and matches the leading models in task (ii) with one-third the parameter size. These findings demonstrate the power of a unified foundation model to comprehensively decode the viral world. LucaVirus is a new tool in AI-driven virology, offering an efficient and versatile platform for board applications from virus discovery to functional predictions.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

Life-history theory proposes that trade-offs and pleiotropic effects across fitness components may explain the evolutionary maintenance of disease-associated alleles. We hypothesize that certain disease-risk alleles might segregate in the population because they confer reproductive advantages, even at the expense of late-life costs on health and longevity. Leveraging genome-wide association studies, we investigated genetic correlations and pleiotropic relationships between 62 complex diseases, longevity, and fertility. In our study, we estimated fertility by meta-analyzing complementary measures of offspring number and used parental lifespan as a proxy for longevity. We found that 85% of diseases showed negative genetic correlations with longevity, whereas 87% of diseases with significant correlations showed positive associations with fertility. Moreover, most disease-risk variants were associated with reduced longevity, even after accounting for socioeconomic confounders. Fertility-increasing alleles exhibited evolutionary signals consistent with adaptive selection despite having pleiotropic effects on disease-risk. Finally, we compared the number of offspring among individuals with high genetic risk of disease and found that, for most diseases, affected individuals had more offspring than disease-free individuals. However, for early-onset conditions, non-affected individuals exhibited higher fertility, highlighting the reproductive cost of early-onset diseases. These findings support the Antagonistic Pleiotropy theory, showing that alleles that enhance early-life reproductive success can persist despite late-life health costs. By uncovering these evolutionary trade-offs between reproduction, longevity, and disease risk, our study shows how Darwinian selection continues to shape contemporary patterns of human disease susceptibility. Understanding these evolutionary trade-offs can inform public health approaches and help anticipate unintended consequences of targeting disease-related genetic pathways.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Recent studies suggest that parkrun, a global physical activity initiative, can promote mental wellbeing and social aspects may be a contributing factor. This study considers the relationship between parkrun participation (as a runner/walker or volunteer) and the social interactions and opportunities it provides. Differences in the social experience with regards to parkrun participation type, gender, and age are explored. A secondary data analysis of a cross-sectional survey of 4,304 parkrun participants in Ireland showed that 30.4% of respondents had high mental wellbeing scores. The most common social interaction was with other parkrun participants at 69.4%, and 48.2% said I feel part of my community at parkrun. People who volunteered at parkrun (in addition to running/walking) were more likely to report social relationships and opportunities than those who did not volunteer. Females were more likely than males to feel isolated at parkrun (20.9% vs 15.4%, p<0.001). The results suggest that parkrun participation may provide a variety of social experiences which supports the inclusion of parkrun in the suite of social prescribing offerings. Providing a supportive environment for social interaction could be a health promotion recommendation for physical activity interventions to enhance the mental wellbeing impacts.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

The aim of this study was to investigate what these changes were before and after the implementation of the 2018 guidelines in Denmark. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Registry data on prescriptions was linked with other registries to create a descriptive overview of treatment patterns was carried out for a nationwide cohort of all individuals receiving at least two non-insulin anti-diabetic drugs (NIADs) between 2012 and 2021. RESULTS: A cohort of 66,188 individuals was identified. The treatment patterns reflected significantly higher use of SGLT2 and GLP1 over time, eclipsing all other drugs, except for insulin, at later treatment stages. First-line use of SGLT2 and GLP1 also became higher over time, as did their likelihood of prescription at later stages. Their combined use rivaled insulin usage at similar stages by 2021. First-line use for women were high in the GLP1 group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds that GLP1 and SGLT2 are used extensively for individuals who have tried multiple NIADs and may delay the use of insulin. Furthermore, there is an increased trend in their first-line use.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

This study aimed to assess the causal effect of blood pressure during pregnancy on a range of pregnancy and perinatal outcomes.

MethodsWe performed two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) to assess the effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) during pregnancy on 16 primary and eight secondary adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. We obtained genetic association data from large-scale metanalyses of genome-wide association studies involving predominantly European ancestry individuals for SBP/DBP (N=1,028,980), and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes (N=77,285-934,566). We used inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR for main analyses and MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, multivariable MR, and IVW adjusted for fetal genetic effects for sensitivity analyses.

ResultsA 10 mmHg higher genetically predicted maternal SBP increased the odds of gestational diabetes, induction of labour, low birth weight (LBW), small-for-gestational age, preterm birth (PTB), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission [OR ranging from 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.14) for PTB to 1.33 (1.26 to 1.41) for LBW]; while decreasing the odds of high birth weight (HBW), large-for-gestational age, and post-term birth [OR ranging from 0.76 (0.69 to 0.83) for HBW to 0.94 (0.90 to 0.99) for post-term birth]. We did not find evidence that genetically predicted higher maternal SBP was related to miscarriage or stillbirth. Results for maternal DBP were similar to results for SBP. Overall, the main results were consistent across sensitivity analyses accounting for pleiotropic instruments and fetal genetic effects.

ConclusionsHigher maternal blood pressure reduces gestation duration and fetal growth, and increases the risks of induction of labour, gestational diabetes and NICU admission. This and other emerging evidence highlight the value of interventions to control maternal blood pressure during pregnancy to reduce the burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Material and MethodsThe dental arches in ten human jaw specimens (five maxillae, five mandibulae) were scanned using two intraoral 3D scanners before and after exposure to controlled blunt trauma delivered via a drop tower mechanism applying approximately 3154 Newton of force. Trauma outcomes were documented through high-speed video, digital photography, and 3D scanning. Post-trauma scans were processed using the keypoint pipeline, which quantifies dental surface similarity by comparing curvature signatures. An all-vs-all comparison was conducted between pre- and post-trauma scans, including cross-scanner evaluations.

ResultsDespite consistent trauma application, fracture patterns varied by jaw type, with mandibular fractures typically occurring in the frontal plane in the side segments and maxillary fractures in the sagittal plane in the midline suture. The keypoint pipeline successfully scored 92.5% of the true matches to be the best matching comparison, even in the presence of significant structural damage and tooth displacement. Matching pairs yielded lower dissimilarity scores (mean: 0.55) compared to mismatches (mean: 0.78), indicating that curvature features were sufficiently preserved post-trauma.

ConclusionsThese findings support the integration of curvature-based 3D dental surface analysis into forensic odontology workflows, particularly in disaster victim identification scenarios involving blunt force trauma.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

Aggregation can obscure important variation across subgroups, limiting opportunities for targeted prevention.

MethodsWe analyzed 2014-2023 California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (n=100,177) to estimate prevalence of 28 health indicators across racial and ethnic groups, including disaggregated Multiracial subgroups. We categorized participants based on all self-identified races and aggregated subgroups with N<50. We standardized prevalence by age and sex using 2020 California census data, calculated relative standard errors, and used survey-weighted methods to compare prevalence and subgroup differences.

ResultsAmong 100,177 participants, Multiracial subgroups had the highest prevalence for 24 of 28 outcomes. American Indian or Alaska Native-Black and Hispanic-Black-White adults had the highest prevalence of chronic conditions, poor general health, and disability. In contrast, Asian Multiracial subgroups (e.g., Asian-Black, Asian-Pacific Islander) more often had the lowest prevalence, though Asian-White adults were not consistently the healthiest subgroup. Differences across Multiracial subgroups exceeded 20 percentage points for nearly half of all outcomes.

DiscussionWide health variation among Multiracial adults is masked by common aggregation practices. Subgroups with the highest burden may be overlooked if data are not routinely disaggregated.

Further analyses suggested that these associations generalize to other psychiatric disorders. These findings offer novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying panic, the role of afferent neurons, and may inform the development of more targeted and effective interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

This analysis aimed to understand the impact of medical intervention initiated with GnRHas on psychological well-being among youth with gender dysphoria over 24 months.

MethodsParticipants were enrolled as part of the Trans Youth Care United States Study. Eligibility criteria for youth included a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria and pubertal initiation. Youth with precocious puberty or pre-existing osteoporosis were ineligible. Youth reported on depressive symptoms, emotional health and suicidality at baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Parent/caretaker completed the Child Behavior Checklist at baseline, 12 and 24 months after initiation of GnRHas. Latent Growth-Curve Models analyzed trajectories of change over the 24-month period.

ResultsNinety-four youth aged 8-16 years (mean=11.2 y) were predominately Non-Hispanic White (56%), early pubertal (86%) and assigned male at birth (52%). Depression symptoms, emotional health and CBCL constructs did not change significantly over 24 months. At no time points were the means of depression, emotional health or CBCL constructs in a clinically concerning range.

ConclusionParticipants initiating medical interventions for gender dysphoria with GnRHas have self- and parent-reported psychological and emotional health comparable with the population of adolescents at large, which remains relatively stable over 24 months. Given that the mental health of youth with gender dysphoria who are older is often poor, it is likely that puberty blockers prevent the deterioration of mental health.

Whats known on this subjectPuberty blockers are effective in halting endogenous puberty and prior research suggests improved mental health in youth with gender dysphoria. Few studies originate from the United States and most include older youth in later stages of puberty at initiation of blockers.

What this study addsThis is the largest longitudinal cohort of youth with gender dysphoria initiating medical intervention beginning with puberty blockers in early puberty to be followed in the United States. Youth demonstrated both stability and improvement in emotional and mental health over 24 months.

Current tools (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, cardiopulmonary exercise testing [CPET], computed tomography [CT]) are limited in dynamic monitoring due to delayed responsiveness, operational complexity, or radiation risks, and other constraints.

MethodsThe ORC testing methodology integrates the dynamic load-incrementation logic of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with the oxygenation quantification framework of PaO2/FiO2. Its operational paradigm comprises three phases:

 {sscircled1}Testing Protocol

Conducted under ventilation-locked conditions, a stepwise FiO2 titration protocol is applied, with termination triggered when SpO2

 {sscircled2}Parameter Definition

The minimum FiO2 required to maintain SpO2 [&ge;]90% (FiO2-MIN) is recorded, and the oxygen reserve capacity is calculated as ORC = 0.21 - FiO2-MIN.

 {sscircled3}Dynamic Modeling

Through continuous monitoring throughout the entire disease course, ORC time-series data are acquired. A time-ORC curve is then fitted, and based on differential calculus ({beta} = {Delta}ORC/{Delta}t, {gamma} = {Delta}{beta}/{Delta}t), they collectively establish a quantitative respiratory compensation dynamics model in conjunction with the time-ORC curve.

ResultsThe ORC test provides a novel non-invasive tool for dynamic quantification of respiratory reserve. Early warning of ARDS transformation during acute infection and quantitative dynamic tracking of lung dysfunction of long-COVID syndrome are its potential application scenarios. Its clinical utility requires prospective validation through multicenter trials integrated with CPET and CT quantitative analysis.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562

We investigated how the body and brain gather informative sensory signals from a wearable augmentation interface (a robotic digit for motor augmentation), and whether naturally-mediated feedback can support technological embodiment.

Participants intuitively interpreted natural feedback across perceptual tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art artificial feedback systems. fMRI revealed an immediate and distinct, topographically-organised representation of the robotic digit. After longitudinal training, this representation was further refined, becoming more similar to the biological digits, which correlated with increased subjective somatosensory embodiment.

Our findings demonstrate that wearable devices naturally provide a powerful source of feedback which is immediately integrated with our body. Long-term use can then promote device-embodiment across the sensorimotor hierarchy.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

Previous structural studies have advanced our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein architecture and function, however, the lack of high-resolution in situ structures of the glycoprotein tetramer and its lattice organization has limited mechanistic insights into viral assembly, entry, and antigenicity. Here, we leveraged a virus-like particle (VLP) system to establish a cryo-electron microscopy workflow for lattice-forming viral glycoproteins. This enabled the determination of a 2.35 [A] resolution structure of the membrane-embedded Andes virus (ANDV) glycoprotein tetramer, as well as structures of dimers of tetramers and a complex with antibody ADI-65534. These structures reveal previously uncharacterized features of glycoprotein organization, stability, and pH-sensing. Immunization of mice with self-amplifying replicon RNA (repRNA) encoding ANDV-VLPs elicited high levels of glycoprotein-binding antibodies but equivalent titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to repRNA-encoded native ANDV glycoprotein complex. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of hantavirus glycoprotein assemblies and their function, laying a foundation for structure-based vaccine design efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

While this protective niche has been described, the molecular determinants orchestrating its formation and dictating its immune interactions are not well defined. Using Perturb-map, we determine how dozens of different gene perturbations shape the growth and cellular environments of PDAC clones through space and time. Our study reveals dynamic, gene-specific adaptations of immune neighborhoods during clonal selection. We identified Serpinb2 (PAI2) and Serpine1 (PAI1) as key cancer-derived mediators of TME remodeling and immune evasion. These factors promote the deposition of a fibrin-rich ECM that shapes immune cell composition, locally retains and polarizes immunosuppressive macrophages and excludes cytotoxic T cells. Deletion of either Serpinb2 or Serpine1 greatly enhanced tumor response to anti-PD1 immunotherapy in an aggressive PDAC model. Transcriptomic analysis further linked their expression to distinct PDAC subtypes and poor patient survival. Our findings demonstrate that Serpinb2 and Serpine1 establish a permissive niche for tumor progression and show how PDAC cells exploit components of the fibrinolysis pathway to remodel the ECM, alter macrophage composition, and protect themselves from immune editing, ultimately reinforcing the role of extracellular factors in shaping an immune-privileged tumor niche.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

In ovules of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), one of the two synergid cells degenerates at fertilization, while the fertilized egg cell (zygote) undergoes directional elongation followed by asymmetric division to initiate embryonic patterning. However, morphological analysis of these events has been hampered by the limitations of conventional cell wall staining, which fails to label cells lacking complete walls, and by the requirement for transgenic fluorescent reporters to visualize cell outlines. Here, we report that the membrane-specific fluorescent dye FM4-64 readily permeates ovules, allowing clear visualization of reproductive cell morphology both before and after fertilization. This staining method supports high-resolution time-lapse imaging and quantitative analysis of early embryogenesis in living tissues. Importantly, it is applicable not only to the angiosperm A. thaliana but also to the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (M. polymorpha) and the fern Ceratopteris richardii (C. richardii), enabling the visualization of live reproductive cell structures within maternal tissues and revealing fertilization-associated morphological changes. This simple and robust method thus provides a valuable tool for spatiotemporal and quantitative analyses of reproductive processes across a broad range of plant species, without the need to generate transgenic lines.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

For this reason, the genetic profiles of Genghis Khan and his descendants are of keen academic and public interest. His Y-chromosome has been hypothesized to belong to haplogroup C3* (C2a1a3-F1918) but this has yet to be substantiated. To explore the genetic ancestry of Genghis Khan, we analyzed four archaeological individuals from the Golden Horde, including three males and one female, who were buried in separate medieval elite mausoleums in the Ulitau region of Kazakstan. One of the males is believed to be Joshi (Juchi), the eldest son of Genghis Khan. We generated genomic data from these archaeological individuals and found that the three males were paternally related, sharing the Y-chromosome haplogroup C3*, consistent with the hypothesized signature haplotype of Genghis Khan. In addition, we confirm that the Golden Horde elites derived most of their genomes from Ancient Northeast Asians (ANA) while having an additional ancestral component from either Ancient North Eurasians (ANE) or a Berel Scythian related population. Furthermore, we were able to identify their medieval relatives in the Mongolian Plateau through constructing an Identity by Descent (IBD) network.","NA","biorxiv",1750716579562

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750716579562
