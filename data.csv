Mechanical thrombectomy has become a standard treatment to remove obstructive clots, providing a unique opportunity to analyze their properties. We previously demonstrated that blood can clot into an amyloid-like form, generating fibrinaloid microclots (2 to 200 m) that are highly resistant to fibrinolysis. In this study, archived clots from eight ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion were examined, using samples stored in the Walton Centre Clot Bank in Liverpool, UK. All clots exhibited strong, heterogeneous amyloid staining, revealing a pervasive amyloid component. These findings represent a previously unreported characteristic of stroke clots, highlighting the potential for amyloid-targeted therapies to overcome their fibrinolytic resistance and providing a foundational new insight into ischaemic stroke pathophysiology and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Using AI to predict the structure of macromolecular complexes, is gaining attention for modelling known interactions and evaluating the likelihood of proteins forming multimers or interacting with other proteins or nucleic acids. There is a growing need for tools to efficiently evaluate these predicted models. We introduce new tools that use AlphaFold3s ""predicted local-distance difference test"" (pLDDT), ""predicted aligned error"" (PAE), and ""predicted distance error"" (PDE) matrices in a graph-based community clustering approach to label sequence motifs involved in binary interactions. The resulting ""interaction image"" is processed through a multidimensional image algorithm to cluster interacting sequence motifs in three-dimensional binary interfaces. This method allows us to present the interaction information between multiple proteins and nucleic acids back to two-dimensional space using chord diagrams. These ""AlphaBridge"" diagrams summarise predicted interfaces and intermolecular interactions, including prediction confidence and sequence conservation scores. They are valuable for efficient screening of predictions, ranking, and scoring the confidence of predicted interactions, prior to more detailed (and resource intensive) analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of the clonal landscapes of human tissues, and their impact on cancer risk, ageing and disease, remains limited due to the challenge of detecting somatic mutations present in small numbers of cells. Here, we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)11, a duplex sequencing method with error rates <5 errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity enables the simultaneous detection of mutations in large numbers of clones, yielding accurate somatic mutation rates, mutational signatures and driver mutation frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 samples of blood from a twin cohort, we found an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection, with 49 genes under positive selection driving clonal expansions in the oral epithelium, over 62,000 driver mutations, and evidence of negative selection in some genes. The high number of positively selected mutations in multiple genes provides high-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites, a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how carcinogenic exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing has the potential to unveil the polyclonal landscape of any tissue, providing a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

However, how aging reshapes the translational landscape of stem cells and how these changes impact their regenerative capacity remains poorly understood. Here, we present an in vivo single-cell ribosome profiling strategy to monitor tissue-wide translational landscapes of the young and aged mouse epidermis. By implementing ribosomal elongation-inhibited cell isolation and switching to RNase I ribonuclease for generating ribosomal footprints, we expand the applicability of single-cell ribosome profiling to in vivo systems and facilitate the evaluation of triplet periodicity, a hallmark of high-quality ribosome profiling data. Leveraging this strategy and integrating ribosome profiling with single-cell RNA sequencing, we document the in vivo translational landscapes of the major epidermal cell types, outline cell-type-specific translational efficiencies and capture heterogeneity in differentiation commitment within stem cell populations. Notably, we identify a pronounced translational reprogramming of AP-1 subunits specifically in aged epidermal stem cells, with functional consequences for keratinocyte behavior. Our study illustrates the power of in vivo single-cell ribosome profiling to map cell-type-specific translational programs and offers a scalable strategy for tissue-wide interrogation of translational landscapes at single-cell resolution.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Here, we found that both KP.3.1.1 and XEC maintained the high ACE2-Spike binding affinity and pseudovirus infectivity of KP.3. Importantly, compared to KP.3, KP.3.1.1, and especially XEC, could further evade the neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma, even those elicited by KP.2-like breakthrough infections. Interestingly, both variants demonstrated increased resistance against monoclonal neutralizing antibodies targeting various epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD).

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Using optical neuroimaging to probe neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). We further found that ECT stimulation pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD. To translate these findings to human patients, we tested for the presence of hemodynamic signatures of post-ictal CSD using non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments. We found evidence that humans generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD.

However, data on the type of antibiotics prescribed for such infections is only available for children <5 years in the UK. Understanding the contribution of RSV to antibiotic prescribing would facilitate predicting the impact of RSV preventative measures on antibiotic use and resistance. Objectives: To estimate the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions in English general practice attributable to RSV by age and antibiotic class. Methods: Generalised additive models examined associations between weekly counts of general practice antibiotic prescriptions and laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from 2015 to 2018, adjusting for temperature, practice holidays and remaining seasonal confounders. We used general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and microbiology tests for RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human Metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae from England's Second Generation Surveillance System. Results: An estimated 2.1% of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, equating to an average of 640,000 prescriptions annually. Of these, adults [&ge;]75 years contributed to the greatest volume, with an annual average of 149,078 (95% credible interval: 93,733-206,045).

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis is known to increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders. Until recently, characterising the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Using the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq, we sequenced 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24 to 75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% CI = 1.41-1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome, driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified over 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 novel) under significant positive selection in the male germline, implicating both activating and loss-of-function mechanisms and diverse cellular pathways. Most positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, while four genes that exhibit elevated frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We find that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2-3 fold elevated risk of known disease-causing mutations in sperm, resulting in 3-5% of sperm from middle-aged to elderly individuals carrying a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on the dynamics of germline mutations and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

At the cellular level, psychedelics induce structural neural plasticity, exemplified by the drug-evoked growth and remodeling of dendritic spines in cortical pyramidal cells. A key question is how these cellular modifications map onto cell type-specific circuits to produce psychedelics' behavioral actions. Here, we use in vivo optical imaging, chemogenetic perturbation, and cell type-specific electrophysiology to investigate the impact of psilocybin on the two main types of pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. We find that a single dose of psilocybin increased the density of dendritic spines in both the subcortical-projecting, pyramidal tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) cell types. Behaviorally, silencing the PT neurons eliminates psilocybin's ability to ameliorate stress-related phenotypes, whereas silencing IT neurons has no detectable effect. In PT neurons only, psilocybin boosts synaptic calcium transients and elevates firing rates acutely after administration. Targeted knockout of 5-HT2A receptors abolishes psilocybin's effects on stress-related behavior and structural plasticity. Collectively these results identify a pyramidal cell type and the 5-HT2A receptor in the medial frontal cortex as playing essential roles for psilocybin's long-term drug action.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

However, most biomarkers today are based on measurements derived from bulk cell measurements, making it challenging to interpret whether an effect is due to changes in cell type composition (systemic factors) or a cell intrinsic effect. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a unique platform to simultaneously compare aging-associated changes on both a cellular and bulk level. We first generated a single-cell combined automated human blood cell type and age predictor (clock) for six distinct human T cell subsets. We applied these tools to find acute COVID is associated with a shift in CD8+ cytotoxic cell proportions, while cell type proportions are stable in patients with HIV on long-term ART treatment (HIV+ART). Both COVID and HIV+ART were associated with an increase in naive CD8 T cell transcriptomic age. We further found our single-cell aging biomarker is linked to ribosomal gene expression and has a link to mean cellular transcript length. This study highlights the potential of single cell transcriptomic biomarkers for understanding how the human immune system is impacted by age-associated systemic changes in cell type composition and intrinsic cellular aging.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Existing solutions typically rely on circuit redesign with alternative topologies or additional control elements, yet a broadly applicable approach remains elusive. Here, we introduce a new strategy based on liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) to stabilize circuit performance. By engineering a self-activating circuit with transcription factors (TF) fused to an intrinsically disordered region (IDR), we enable the formation of TF condensates at the promoter region, maintaining local TF concentration despite growth-mediated dilution. This condensate formation preserves bistable memory in the self-activating circuit, demonstrating that phase separation can robustly counteract growth fluctuations, offering a novel design principle for resilient synthetic circuits.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Our studies in humanized mice and non-human primates (NHPs) demonstrate that hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) modified with anti-HIV CAR leads to lifelong engraftment and supply of functional anti-viral CAR-T cells, leading to significantly reduced viral rebound after ART withdrawal. However, T cell exhaustion, driven by chronic immune activation, remains a major challenge for the continuous efficacy of CAR-T therapy, necessitating additional measures to achieve functional cure. We recently showed that in vivo treatment with low dose rapamycin reduced chronic inflammation and improved anti-HIV T cell function in HIV-infected humanized mice. Here, we report that rapamycin significantly improved CAR-T cell function both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with rapamycin improved CAR-T cell mitochondria respiration and cytotoxicity. In vivo treatment with low-dose rapamycin in HIV-infected, CAR-HSC treated mice reduced chronic inflammation, prevented exhaustion of CAR-T cells and improved CAR-T control of viral replication compared to CAR-HSCs treatment alone. RNAseq analysis of sorted CAR-T cells from humanized mice showed that rapamycin significantly modified the CAR-T cell transcriptome, including the downregulation of multiple check point inhibitors and the upregulation of key genes related to cell survival. We also observed significantly delayed viral rebound after ART withdrawal and diminished HIV reservoir in mice that were treated with rapamycin and CAR-HSCs as compared to CAR-HSCs treatment alone. Taken together, our data indicate that HSCs-based anti-HIV CAR-T combined with rapamycin treatment is a promising approach for treating persistent inflammation and improving immune control of HIV replication.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Although its effectiveness has been estimated to range between 36-86%, the persistence of protection is still unknown.

Aims of this study is to assess the immune response one year after vaccination with MVA-BN.

MethodsObservational prospective study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. All people at high risk for mpox infection who received MVA-BN as pre-exposure prophylaxis were enrolled. People previously primed with smallpox vaccination received a single-dose course of MVA-BN, while non-primed received a two-dose course. Blood samples were collected at the time of each dose and one, six and 12 months after vaccination. MPXV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed by immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization tests, respectively. Interferon-{gamma} producing T-cell specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine was analyzed by ELISpot assay. Antibody titers at pre- and post-vaccination were compared using the Friedman tests. Mann Whitney test was used to compare antibody titers in PLWH vs PLWoH. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare T-cells specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine for intra and inter-group differences, respectively.

ResultsFifty high-risk people were included. All were men, with 94% self-reporting having sex with men. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-57), and 21 (42%) were people living with HIV (PLWH), all on antiretroviral therapy, and 71% with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 L. 25 (50%) have been primed with previous smallpox vaccination.

In non-primed people, anti-MPXV IgG titers significantly increased from T1 to T3 and, despite a slight reduction, were still higher than T1 up to T4 and then gradually decreased until T5, when 64% of sera were still reactive. MPXV-nAb titers peaked at T3 and then dropped, with 56% and 32% of sera reactive at T4 and T5, respectively. IFN-{gamma} production by MVA-BN-specific T-cells progressively rose across time, peaked at T3, and remained significantly higher than the baseline after 6 and 12 months from vaccination. A single-dose course of MVA-BN vaccination in smallpox-primed participants elicited an early increase in IgG and nAb titers, which remained significantly higher than baseline after 6 and 12 months. MPXV-nAbs were detected in 80% and 72% of vaccinees at T4 and T5, respectively. A similar improvement and maintenance were observed for the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response. No evidence for a difference in both humoral and cellular responses was found between PLWH and PLWoH in our cohort.

ConclusionsOne year after vaccination, our data showed the persistent detectability of low levels of nAb against MPXV in one-third of non-primed individuals. At the same time, humoral response was still detectable in most previously vaccinated participants. Concurrently, the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response was robust and persistent.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

In response to the outbreak in the UK, a reactive mpox vaccination programme was targeted to those most at risk. We explore the uptake and course completion of mpox vaccination in GBMSM taking part in an online survey in 2023. Findings from this community sample indicate vaccination uptake in around two-thirds of participants meeting mpox proxy eligibility criteria with high levels of course completion among all and eligible participants that were ever vaccinated. Vaccine non-offer was a barrier to uptake, as nearly a third of those eligible but unvaccinated reported never having received an mpox vaccine offer. Continued targeting of vaccination to GBMSM at highest risk of mpox at SHS, with community-support, will help facilitate equitable uptake of vaccination.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

Clusters can facilitate transcription, but it remains unclear how they form. It has been suggested that clusters are seeded by the sequence-specific binding of TFs to DNA, and grow by IDR-IDR interactions that bring in more TFs. This model, however, does not explain how TFs can cluster in specific combinations. Here, we study TF clustering by quantitative imaging of Nanog, Pou5f3, and Sox19b in zebrafish embryos. Using mutant and chimaeric TFs, we show that the formation of a TF cluster requires the DBD as well as at least one of its IDRs. In contrast with the existing model, however, IDRs are not sufficient to join a preexisting cluster. Instead, both IDR and DBD are needed. Thus, for any TF to join a cluster, motif recognition is required, which explains the specificity in cluster formation. Finally, we show that while IDRs are required to join a cluster, their amino acid sequence is interchangeable, and the DBD can confer specificity to any IDR. Taken together, our work changes the model of cluster formation and explains how specificity is achieved in the organization of transcriptional machinery in the nucleus.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Analyzing binding motifs of 686 and the binding sites of 335 A. thaliana transcription factors as well as motifs of 92 transcription factors from other plants, we identified a constrained vocabulary of 74 conserved motifs spanning 50 families in plants.

Five families show conservation of the motif along phylogenetic clades. Five families including the C2H2 zinc finger family show high diversity among motifs in plants, suggesting potential for neofunctionalization of duplicated transcription factors based on the motif recognized.

However, limitations in mammalian models make it difficult to identify mechanisms underpinning age-related DNA methylation changes. Here, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, causing heterochromatin DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing lifespan, and that shoot apical meristems are protected from this aging process. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging, and that mutants of this mechanism display a complete absence of epigenetic decay.

This bursting activity can vary across individual cells, and analyzing the differences in transcription sites can help identify key drivers of gene expression for a specific target. Scaffolding methods based on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been widely used to amplify the fluorescent signal of mRNAs and sort cells based on mRNA expression levels. However, these methods are inefficient at targeting nuclear RNA, including transcription sites, due to the probes limited accessibility through cellular compartment membranes and crosslinked proteins. Additionally, the required formaldehyde fixation interferes with downstream analysis of chromatin and protein-binding interactions. To address these challenges, a platform that integrates amplified FISH with reversible crosslinkers and allows access to the nucleus is needed. In response, we developed nuclear clampFISH (nuclampFISH). This method amplifies the fluorescent signal of mRNAs using a reversible crosslinker, enabling the sorting of cells based on nuclear RNA expression and compatible with downstream biochemical analysis. This assay demonstrates that transcriptionally active cells have more accessible chromatin for a respective gene.

However, current methods for cell fate control are inefficient, imprecise, and rely on laborious trial-and-error. To address these limitations, we present a method for data-driven multi-gene modulation of transcriptional networks. We develop bidirectional CRISPR-based tools based on dCas12a, Cas13d, and dCas9 for simultaneously activating and repressing many genes. Due to the vast combinatorial complexity of multi-gene regulation, we introduce a machine learning-based computational algorithm that uses single-cell RNA sequencing data to predict multi-gene perturbation sets for converting a starting cell type into a desired target cell type. By combining these technologies, we establish a unified workflow for data-driven cell fate engineering and demonstrate its efficacy in controlling early stem cell differentiation while suppressing alternative lineages through logic-based cell fate operations. This approach represents a significant advancement in the use of synthetic biology to engineer cell identity.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

CTCF repositions nucleosomes asymmetrically, with linker spacing altered by accessibility, while cohesin-mediated nucleosome phasing is affected by surrounding motifs which also impact chromatin insulation. Importantly, cell type-specific transcriptional programs determine motif enrichment at CTCF bound sites, reflecting the stabilizing/destabilizing effect of individual TFs.

Regulation of the XMAP215 family member and microtubule polymerase, Stu2, at the metaphase-anaphase transition determines a specific redistribution from kinetochores to spindle microtubules. We show that cells modulate Stu2 kinetochore-microtubule localization by Polo-like kinase1/Cdc5-mediated phosphorylation of T866, near the Stu2 C-terminus, thereby promoting dissociation from the kinetochore Ndc80 complex. Cdk/Cdc28 likely primes Cdc5:Stu2 interaction. Cdc28 activity is also required for Stu2 nuclear import. PP2ACdc55 actively opposes Cdc5 activity on Stu2T866 during metaphase. This counter-regulation allows for switchlike redistribution of Stu2pT866 at anaphase onset when separase inhibits PP2ACdc55. Blocking Stu2T866 phosphorylation disrupts anaphase spindle progression, and we infer that PP2ACdc55 regulates the mitotic spindle by dephosphorylating Stu2 and other MAPs. These data support a model in which increased phosphorylation at anaphase onset results from phosphatase inhibition and point to a larger regulatory network that facilitates rapid cytoskeletal modulation required for anaphase spindle maintenance.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Many of the specimens studied have been excavated and stored for a significant duration prior to their proteomic analysis. Human handling and storage environments therefore provide ample opportunities for protein contamination onto and into specimens of interest to palaeoproteomic studies. As such, modern protein contamination limits access to endogenous proteomes. Here, we compare five approaches of bone protein decontamination applied to a Pleistocene Equus sp. bone fragment contaminated with a modern dog salivary proteome. We find that all tested methods reduce the protein contamination, but with different efficiencies. We find that a brief bleach wash is the most effective approach in removing modern protein contamination, and that no additional damage is caused to the endogenous proteome by this treatment. Next, we apply this approach to a hominin tooth found at Khudji, a Late Pleistocene archaeological site in Tajikistan. We demonstrate that a brief bleach wash removes almost all human skin protein contamination while retaining the endogenous hominin dentine proteome. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the Khudji dentine proteome allowed determination that the specimen is likely not a Denisovan, but still leaves ambiguity between an assignment to either modern humans or Neanderthals.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Discovered in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in camels in the Middle East and is continually causing local outbreaks and epidemics. While all three newly emerging human CoV from past 20 years (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV) cause respiratory disease, each CoV has unique host interactions that drive differential pathogeneses. To better understand the virus and host interactions driving lethal MERS-CoV infection, we performed a longitudinal multi-omics analysis of sublethal and lethal MERS-CoV infection in mice. Significant differences were observed in body weight loss, virus titers and acute lung injury among lethal and sub-lethal virus doses. Virus induced apoptosis of type I and II alveolar epithelial cells suggest that loss or dysregulation of these key cell populations was a major driver of severe disease. Omics analysis suggested differential pathogenesis was multi-factorial with clear differences among innate and adaptive immune pathways as well as those that regulate lung epithelial homeostasis. Infection of mice lacking functional T and B-cells showed that adaptive immunity was important in controlling viral replication but also increased pathogenesis. In summary, we provide a high-resolution host response atlas for MERS-CoV infection and disease severity. Multi-omics studies of viral pathogenesis offer a unique opportunity to not only better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease but also to identify genes and pathways that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention all of which is important for our future pandemic preparedness.

ImportanceEmerging coronaviruses like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV cause a range of disease outcomes in humans from asymptomatic, moderate and severe respiratory disease which can progress to death but the factors causing these disparate outcomes remain unclear. Understanding host responses to mild and life-threatening infection provides insight into virus-host networks within and across organ systems that contribute to disease outcomes. We used multi-omics approaches to comprehensively define the host response to moderate and severe MERS-CoV infection. Severe respiratory disease was associated with dysregulation of the immune response. Key lung epithelial cell populations that are essential for lung function get infected and die. Mice lacking key immune cell populations experienced greater virus replication but decreased disease severity implicating the immune system in both protective and pathogenic roles in the response to MERS-CoV. These data could be utilized to design new therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways that contribute to severe disease.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

However, it is still unclear if, how and where in the brain such flexible planning is enacted. In parallel, it is thought that consolidation transforms memory representations over time to promote adaptive behaviour7. Here, we hypothesize that consolidation strengthens cognitive maps of task contingencies used for simulation during sequential planning. To test this, we developed a novel behavioural task and a new multivariate method for analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Using choice and reaction time data we dissociated flexible sequential planning from alternative non-sequential strategies, and identified this behaviour with robust neural markers of step-by-step simulation, localized to the anterior medial temporal lobe. Retesting a week later we showed that consolidation enhanced sequential planning and strengthened markers of sequential simulation in the prefrontal cortex, consistent with systems consolidation theory8-15. By revealing that consolidation improves future simulations for flexible planning we open up a new frontier for the investigation of the functional interactions between memory and decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Despite consistent and persistent efforts, rates of participation among diverse older adults remain critically low. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to set forth The NGAGE Model, one developed at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rush ADRC) to facilitate community engagement and research participation among diverse older adults. Methods: The NGAGE Model consists of five steps that are conceptually distinct but overlapping in practice: 1) Networking, 2) Give first, 3) Advocate for research, 4) Give back, and 5) Evaluate. We define and describe each step. For steps 1 through 4, we calculated the number of events, number of attendees for each event, and percentages of attendees by racial and ethnic categorizations annually from July 1, 2011, through June 30, 2023, resulting in data for 12 distinct years, as provided in annual progress reports to the National Institute on Aging. For Step 5, we counted the number of persons and computed percentages of people by racial and ethnic groups who consented to our Data and Specimen Repository and enrolled in a research study. Results: Over 12 years, the Rush ADRC conducted 5,362 events with 265,794 attendees. Give First activities represented the NGAGE step with both the highest number of events (n=2,247) and the most attendees (n=124,403).

Our most successful Random Forest classifiers were trained on the annotations of direct protein targets of compounds, such as Gene Ontology, UniProt Keywords, pathways (KEGG, Reactome, Wiki) and protein domains (InterPro), whereas models trained on gene expression (LINCS) and chemical substructures (PubChem) underperformed. Models trained on male datasets performed better than those trained on mixed-sex and female datasets, with the latter suffering from severe class imbalance due to much fewer positive-class instances. Notably, features related to G-protein coupled receptors, especially receptors for neurotransmitters, metabolic hormones and sex hormones, were identified as strong predictors of lifespan extension. We used ensemble classifiers comprised of top models to screen compounds from DrugBank, highlighting novel candidates for longevity studies.

This allowed us to manipulate neuronal lysosome distribution including in axons and interrogate its contribution to both optimal neuronal functioning and to disease pathology. We demonstrate that the small molecule not only rescues aberrant buildup of both axonal autophagic and lysosomal intermediates but also reduces secreted Abeta42 levels in human iPSC-derived neurons lacking the lysosomal adaptor, JIP3. We thus demonstrate that restoring efficient axonal lysosome transport has an anti-amyloidogenic effect in human neurons and is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, we show that the small molecule enhances neuronal lysosome degradation, requires the lysosomal adaptor JIP4 to rescue the axonal lysosome pathology in the JIP3 KO neurons and increases levels of the JIP4-interacting lysosomal membrane protein, TMEM55B. Lastly, treatment with the small molecule led to a striking rescue of locomotor defects in JIP3 KO zebrafish larvae.

Linear electron transfer (LET) supplies both metabolites, yet depending on environmental conditions, additional ATP is required which can be generated by cyclic electron transfer (CET). How the balance between LET and CET is set remains largely unknown. Ferredoxin(FD)-NADP+ reductase (FNR) has been suggested to act as the switch, channelling photosynthetic electrons to LET when it is bound to photosystem I (PSI) or CET when bound to cytochrome b6f. The essential role of FNR in LET precludes the use of a direct gene knock-out to test this hypothesis. We circumvented this problem by using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to create a chimeric form of FNR tethered to PSI via PSAF. Chimeric FNR mutants exhibited impaired photosynthetic growth relative to the wild type, and decreased LET and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) under high CO2 conditions. However, higher rates of CET and increased NPQ were found in the mutants under low CO2 or low O2 conditions where CET is normally up-regulated. Thus, rather than PSI-FNR interactions promoting LET, tethering FNR to PSI promotes CET at the expense of LET and CO2 fixation.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

While data-driven statistical and machine learning methods can identify patterns from omics data across multiple samples, they typically require a large number of samples and they often lack interpretability and alignment with existing biological knowledge. In contrast, knowledge-based network methods integrate molecular data with prior knowledge to provide results that are biologically interpretable, but they lack both a unified mathematical framework, leading to ad-hoc solutions specific to particular data types or prior knowledge, limiting their generalisability, and a common modelling interface for programmatic manipulation, restricting method extensions. Furthermore, existing methods generally cannot perform joint network inference across multiple samples or conditions, which restricts their capacity to capture shared mechanisms, making these methods more sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting. To address these limitations, we introduce CORNETO (Constrained Optimisation for the Recovery of NETworks from Omics), a unified framework for knowledge-driven network inference. CORNETO redefines the joint inference task as a constrained optimisation problem with a penalty that induces structured sparsity, allowing for simultaneous network inference across multiple samples. The framework is highly flexible and supports a wide variety of prior knowledge networks--undirected, directed and signed graphs, as well as hypergraphs--enabling the generalisation and improvement of many network inference methods, despite their seemingly different assumptions. We demonstrate its utility by presenting novel extensions of methods for signalling, metabolism and protein-protein interactions. We show how these new methods improve the performance of traditional techniques on a diverse set of biological tasks using simulated and real data. CORNETO is available as an open-source Python package (github.com/saezlab/corneto), facilitating researchers in extending, reusing, and harmonising methods for network inference.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Through the extracellular release of metabolites, lytic viral infections supply 2-10% of photosynthetically fixed carbon in the ocean for bacterial respiration. Despite its significance for the carbon cycle, we lack tools to detect the viral shunt in the natural environment and assess its ecological impact. Here, we study the use of exometabolites as biomarkers for the viral shunt by applying molecular, metabolomics, and oceanographic tools in blooms of the cosmopolitan microalga Gephyrocapsa huxleyi across the Atlantic Ocean, spanning four biogeochemical provinces between Iceland and Patagonia. We mapped the distinct metabolic footprint of its viral infections using exo- and endometabolomics approaches and detected nineteen organohalogen metabolites across the blooms, showing their global formation. Time-resolved comparison of particulate and dissolved metabolite pools during an induced mesocosm bloom indicated virocells - actively infected host cells - as the source of the halogenated metabolites. Three trichloro-iodo metabolites were present during demise of all virus-infected blooms, highlighting them as suitable metabolic biomarkers. The environmental stability of these halometabolites in the DOM pool over a few days can recapitulate viral infections at earlier stages of phytoplankton bloom succession.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

This discrimination relies on the application of mechanical force to B cell receptor (BCR)-antigen bonds, allowing B cells to selectively disrupt low-affinity interactions while internalizing high-affinity antigens. Using DNA-based tension sensors combined with high-resolution imaging, we demonstrate that the magnitude, location, and timing of forces within the immune synapse are influenced by the fluidity of the antigen-presenting membrane. Transitioning antigens from a high-mobility to a low-mobility substrate significantly increases the probability and speed of antigen extraction while also improving affinity discrimination. This shift in antigen mobility also reshapes the synapse architecture, altering spatial patterns of antigen uptake. Despite these adaptations, B cells maintain consistent levels of proximal and downstream signaling pathway activation regardless of antigen mobility. They also efficiently transport internalized antigens to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII)-positive compartments for processing. These results demonstrate that B cells mount effective responses to antigens across diverse physical environments, though the characteristics of that environment may influence the speed and accuracy of B cell adaptation during an immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

DNA polymerase beta (Pol {beta}) is the primary enzyme responsible for processing the 1-nt gap intermediate in chromatin during SSBR and BER. However, the mechanism used by Pol {beta} to process a 1-nt gap in the context of the nucleosome and chromatin remains poorly understood. Here, we use biochemical assays and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the kinetic and structural basis of gap-filling DNA synthesis in the nucleosome by Pol {beta}. Kinetic analysis identified that gap-filling DNA synthesis in the nucleosome by Pol {beta} is position-dependent, where solvent exposed 1-nt gaps are processed more efficiently than histone-occluded 1-nt gaps. A series of cryo-EM structures of Pol {beta} bound to a solvent-exposed 1-nt gap in the nucleosome reveal a global DNA sculpting mechanism for 1-nt gap recognition, which is mediated by sequential engagement of the Pol {beta} lyase domain and polymerase domain. Finally, cryo-EM structures of Pol {beta} bound to 1-nt gaps at two additional positions in the nucleosomal DNA define the structural basis for position-dependent nucleotide insertion in the nucleosome. This work establishes the mechanism used by Pol {beta} for processing 1-nt gaps in the nucleosome during SSBR and BER, providing fundamental insight into DNA repair in chromatin.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

We conducted high-throughput experimental evolution on Saccharomyces cerevisiae experiencing constitutive replication stress, grown under different glucose availabilities. We found that glucose levels impact the physiology and adaptation rate of replication stress mutants. However, the genetics of adaptation show remarkable robustness across environments.

Recent electrophysiological studies have explored the neural encoding of musical pitch and time by leveraging probabilistic models of their sequences, but few have studied how the features might interact. This study examines these interactions by introducing ""chimeric music,"" which pairs two distinct melodies, and exchanges their pitch contours and note onset-times to create two new melodies, thereby distorting musical pattern while maintaining the marginal statistics of the original pieces' pitch and temporal sequences. Through this manipulation, we aimed to dissect the music processing and the interaction between pitch and time. Employing the temporal response function (TRF) framework, we analyzed the neural encoding of melodic expectation and musical downbeats in participants with varying levels of musical training. Our findings revealed differences in the encoding of melodic expectation between original and chimeric stimuli in both dimensions, with a significant impact of musical experience. This suggests that the structural violation due to decoupling the pitch and temporal structure affect expectation processing. In our analysis of downbeat encoding, we found an enhanced neural response when participants heard a note that aligned with the downbeat during music listening. In chimeric music, responses to downbeats were larger when the note was also a downbeat in the original music that provided the pitch sequence, indicating an effect of pitch structure on beat perception. This study advances our understanding of the neural underpinnings of music, emphasizing the significance of pitch-time interaction in the neural encoding of music.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Recent work has shown that ketone bodies such as {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}-OHB), which are elevated in circulation under fasting conditions or low glycemic diets, can serve as an alternative fuel that is metabolized in the mitochondria to provide acetyl-CoA for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in some tumors. Here, we discover a non-canonical route for {beta}-OHB metabolism, in which {beta}-OHB can bypass the TCA cycle to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA for de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells. We show that {beta}-OHB-derived acetoacetate in the mitochondria can be shunted into the cytosol, where acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) and thiolase convert it into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. This alternative metabolic routing of {beta}-OHB allows it to avoid oxidation in the mitochondria and net contribute to anabolic biosynthetic processes. In cancer cells, {beta}-OHB is used for fatty acid synthesis to support cell proliferation under lipid-limited conditions in vitro and contributes to tumor growth under lipid-limited conditions induced by a calorie-restricted diet in vivo.

Remarkably, pachytene piRNAs slice hundreds of RNAs, yet a change in steady-state level is detectable for a small fraction of transcripts. Our data suggest that cleavage of the few targets whose abundance is reduced significantly by piRNAs is essential for male fertility. Other pachytene piRNA targets are enriched for highly transcribed genes, which may explain why piRNA cleavage is often inconsequential for the steady-state abundance of targets. We propose that the retention of pachytene piRNAs throughout mammalian evolution is driven by the selective advantage conferred by a tiny minority of piRNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Predicting sex from adolescent brain data may offer valuable insights into how these variations shape neurodevelopment. Recently, attention has shifted toward exploring socially-identified gender, distinct from sex assigned at birth, recognizing its additional explanatory power. This study evaluates whether resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) or cortical thickness more effectively predicts sex and sex/gender alignment (the congruence between sex and gender) and investigates their interrelationship in preadolescents. Using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we employed machine learning to predict both sex (assigned at birth) and sex/gender alignment from rsFC and cortical thickness. rsFC predicted sex with significantly higher accuracy (86%) than cortical thickness (75%) and combining both did not improve the rsFC models accuracy. Brain regions most effective in predicting sex belonged to association (default mode, dorsal attention, and parietal memory) and visual (visual and medial visual) networks. The rsFC sex classifier trained on sex/gender aligned youth was significantly more effective in classifying unseen youth with sex/gender alignment than in classifying unseen youth with sex/gender unalignment. In females, the degree to which their brains rsFC matched a sex profile (female or male), was positively associated with the degree of sex/gender alignment. Lastly, neither rsFC nor cortical thickness predicted sex/gender alignment. These findings highlight rsFCs predictive power in capturing the relationship between sex and gender and the complexity of the interplay between sex, gender, and the brains functional connectivity and neuroanatomy.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) dissipates excess light energy as heat, with the quenching component qH providing sustained photoprotection. However, the molecular mechanism underlying qH induction remains unclear. Our study focuses on the thylakoid membrane protein SUPPRESSOR OF QUENCHING 1 (SOQ1) and its inhibition of qH through interaction with LIPOCALIN IN THE PLASTID (LCNP) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Structural homology of SOQ1 lumenal domains with bacterial disulfide bond protein D suggested potential thiol-disulfide exchange activity. In vitro assays determined that both SOQ1 thioredoxin-like (Trx-like) and C-terminal (CTD) domains contain a redox-active cysteine pair and evidenced electron transfer from Trx-like to CTD. Importantly, we found that SOQ1 lumenal domains exhibit methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) activity converting oxidized methionine residues in LCNP back to methionine, which thereby inactivates LCNP and prevents qH formation. Mutational analyses identified cysteine residues in SOQ1-CTD and methionine residues in LCNP as critical for qH suppression, supporting their role in redox regulation. Additionally, we found that the redox state of SOQ1 in vivo is light-dependent, shifting from reduced to oxidized under stress conditions, indicating a dynamic regulation of its activity. We conclude that the Trx-like domain of SOQ1 provides reducing power to its CTD displaying Msr activity. SOQ1 is therefore an unusual example of a protein possessing both a disulfide reductase and Msr domain in tandem. Our findings elucidate the redox-regulation mechanism of qH involving SOQ1-mediated methionine reduction of LCNP, providing insights into the intricate control of photoprotective processes in chloroplasts and enhancing our understanding of plant resilience under environmental stress.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Yet, due to historical challenges in their accurate calling and analysis, TRs have remained underexplored compared to single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Here, we introduce a cell type-specific resource exploring the impact of TR variation on human gene expression. Leveraging whole genome and single-cell RNA sequencing, we catalog over 1.7 million polymorphic TR loci and their associations with gene expression across more than 5 million blood-derived cells from 1,790 individuals. We identify over 58,000 single-cell expression quantitative trait TR loci (sc-eTRs), 16.6% of which are specific to one of 28 distinct immune cell types. Further fine-mapping uncovers 6,210 sc-eTRs as candidate causal drivers of gene expression in 21% of genes tested genome-wide. We show through colocalization that TRs are likely regulators of over 2,000 GWAS loci associated with immune-mediated and hematological traits, and further identify novel TRs warranting investigation in rare disease cohorts. TRs are pivotal, yet long-overlooked, contributors to cell type-specific gene expression, with promising implications for understanding rare disease pathogenesis and the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Using non-invasive imaging transcriptomics, we measured ACE2, TMPRSS2, and HLA-DQA2 mRNA expression in gray matter volumes using MRI scans obtained from 1,045 healthy adults aged 21-35 years (44% male) imaged prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Europe, their application on cereals increased drastically starting from the mid 1970s, contributing to a significant improvement in yields. However, extensive usage has led to the rapid evolution of resistant pathogen populations within just a few years of fungicide deployment. Here we focus on wheat powdery mildew, a disease caused by the ascomycete fungus Blumeria graminis forma specialis tritici (Bgt). Previous research on Bgt documented the emergence of resistance to different fungicides and identified various resistance mechanisms. Yet, the frequency, distribution, and evolutionary dynamics of fungicide resistance in Bgt populations remain largely unexplored. In this study we leveraged extensive sampling and whole-genome sequencing of Bgt populations in Europe and the Mediterranean to investigate the population genetics and molecular epidemiology of fungicide resistance towards five major fungicide classes. We analyzed gene sequences and copy number variation of eight known fungicide target genes in 415 Bgt isolates sampled between 1980 and 2023. We observed that mutations conferring resistance to various fungicides increased in frequency over time, and had distinct geographic distributions, likely due to diverse deployment of fungicides across different regions. For demethylation inhibitor fungicides we identified multiple independent events of resistance emergence with distinct mutational profiles, and we tracked their rapid spread in the last decades. Overall, we revealed the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of fungicide resistance mutations in European Bgt populations. These results underscore the potential of genomic surveillance and population genetics to enhance our understanding of fungicide resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

The post-mitotic status of polyploid adult CMs poses a clear limit to heart regeneration. Thus, understanding how CMs acquire this polyploid status is relevant to heart regeneration therapies. Here, we aim to unveil that the PIDDosome, a multi-protein complex known to limit scheduled and accidental polyploidization events by activating p53, implements a CM-specific genetic program that controls polyploidization during postnatal heart development in mice. Flow cytometric DNA content analysis coupled with image-based 3D volumetric measurements of CM nuclei showed that PIDDosome knockout animals harbor significantly more polyploid CM nuclei compared to WT controls. Remarkably, the increased CM ploidy levels do not interfere with cardiac structure or functional output and is implemented in a cell-autonomous manner. During early heart development, ploidy analyses revealed that the PIDDosome starts to shape CM ploidy at postnatal day 7 (P7), reaching a plateau of activity on postnatal day P14. In line with observations made in the hepatocytes, PIDDosome activation in CMs is dependent on PIDD1 localization to extra centrosomes in cells that fail cytokinesis via the distal appendage protein ANKRD26. Interestingly, but in contrast to prior observations in hepatocytes, the PIDDosome limits CM polyploidization in a p53-independent manner but still involves the CDK-inhibitor, p21/Cdkn1a, a notion supported by nuclear RNA sequencing and genetic analyses. Together these results provide a new mechanism how proliferation of polyploid CMs is restricted during development, adding new mechanistic insight into the tightly regulated program of terminal differentiation events occurring in the postnatal heart.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

One way in which this requirement can be met is if each of these cognitive functions occur as part of a repeated cycle. Here, we studied the temporal evolution of large-scale cortical networks, and show that while network dynamics are stochastic, the overall ordering of their activity forms a robust cyclical pattern. This cyclical structure groups states with similar function and spectral content at specific phases of the cycle and occurs at timescales of (300-1000 ms). These results are reproduced in five large magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets. Moreover, we show that metrics that characterize the cycle strength and speed are heritable, and relate to age, cognition, and behavioural performance. These results suggest that cortical network activations are inherently cyclical, ensuring periodic activation of essential cognitive functions.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Here, functional mapping revealed robust excitatory input from auditory and temporal association cortexes to substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL) DANs, but not to pars compacta (SNc) DANs. SNL DANs exhibited unique firing patterns, with irregular pacemaking and higher maximal firing, reflecting different channel complements than SNc DANs. Behaviorally, inhibiting cortex to SNL projections impaired memory retrieval during auditory threat conditioning.

Clinical data from patient records were used to calculate a Symptom Score, and screening tools for stress/PTSD (PCL-5), anxiety (GAD-7), and quality of life (SWL) were employed to evaluate if Long COVID duration and severity could predict neuropsychiatric outcomes. The majority were female (71%) and Hispanic (53%) who presented for treatment of Long COVID symptoms during the study period, including fatigue (93%), coughing/shortness of breath (81%), fever (67%), anosmia (58%), ageusia (54%), and weight loss (56%). There was a high burden of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including subjective cognitive impairment (79%), headache (74%), and insomnia (58%). Symptom Score (median = 9, IQR [8,11]) was significantly correlated with increased depression (PHQ-9; p < 0.05), anxiety (GAD-7; p < 0.05) and elevated stress/PTSD (PCL-5; p < 0.05) symptoms.

Importantly, duration of Long COVID symptomatology also did not predict PCL-5 scores. No patient factors (e.g., sex, age, BMI, ethnicity) mediated Symptom Score. Nonetheless, historically marginalized groups, such as women and Hispanics, have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. This study is the first to utilize validates screening tools to determine the presence and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Long COVID patients. These findings may guide clinical management and future research on Long COVID, especially in historically excluded populations.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

Here, using multi-brain-region calcium photometry recording in freely-moving mice, we discover that stress induces a unique, bimodal neuronal response and a most rapid astrocytic response in the LHb. LHb astrocytic calcium requires the 1A-adrenergic receptor, and depends on a recurrent neural network between the LHb and locus coeruleus (LC). Through the gliotransmitter glutamate and ATP/Adenosine, LHb astrocytes mediate the second-wave activation of local LHb neurons as well as release of norepinephrine (NE). Activation or inhibition LHb astrocytic calcium signaling facilitates or prevents stress-induced depressive-like behaviors respectively. These results identify a stress-induced positive feedback loop in the LHb-LC axis, with astrocytes being a critical signaling relay. The identification of this prominent neuron-glia interaction may shed light on stress management and depression prevention.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

In flowering plants, two distinct female gametes, the egg cell and the central cell, are fertilized, producing what will become the embryo and the endosperm of the seed. In Arabidopsis, a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase, DME, demethylates regions in the central cell genome, leading to methylation differences between maternally- and paternally-inherited endosperm genomes after fertilization. DME is required for endosperm gene imprinting. Homologues of DME include ROS1, DML2 and DML3. It is unknown whether any of these DNA glycosylases are required for endosperm methylation patterning. We show that ROS1 prevents hypermethylation of paternally-inherited alleles in the endosperm at regions that lack maternal or paternal-allele methylation in wild-type. Thus, ROS1 promotes epigenetic symmetry between genomes in the endosperm by preventing paternal genome hypermethylation. We propose that ROS1 and DME act in a parent-of-origin-specific manner at shared endosperm targets, and consider implications for the evolution of imprinting mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

For example, they are used to index large textual collections, like DNA, and to compare sequences quickly. In such applications, a sampling algorithm is required to select one k-mer out of every window of w consecutive k-mers. The folklore and most used scheme is the random minimizer that selects the smallest k-mer in the window according to some random order. This scheme is remarkably simple and versatile, and has a density (expected fraction of selected k-mers) of 2/(w + 1). In practice, lower density leads to faster methods and smaller indexes, and it turns out that the random minimizer is not the best one can do. Indeed, some schemes are known to approach optimal density 1/w when k [-&gt;]{infty}, like the recently introduced mod-minimizer (Groot Koerkamp and Pibiri, WABI 2024). In this work, we study methods that achieve low density when k [&le;]w. In this small-k regime, a practical method with provably better density than the random minimizer is the miniception (Zheng et al., Bioinformatics 2021). This method can be elegantly described as sampling the smallest closed sycnmer (Edgar, PeerJ 2021) in the window according to some random order. We show that extending the miniception to prefer sampling open syncmers yields much better density. This new method - the open-closed minimizer - offers improved density for small k [&le;]w while being as fast to compute as the random minimizer. Compared to methods based on decycling sets, that achieve very low density in the small-k regime, our method has comparable density while being computationally simpler and intuitive. Furthermore, we extend the mod-minimizer to improve density of any scheme that works well for small k to also work well when k > w is large. We hence obtain the open-closed mod-minimizer, a practical method that improves over the mod-minimizer for all k.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Previous cerebellar coordinate-based meta-analyses and mappings have attributed different behaviors to cerebellar subareas, but an accurate behavioral topography is lacking. Here, we show overrepresentation of superior activation foci, which may be exacerbated by historical cerebellar neglect. Unequal foci distributions render the null hypothesis of standard activation likelihood estimation unsuitable. Our new method, cerebellum-specific activation-likelihood estimation (C-SALE), finds behavioral convergence beyond baseline activation rates. It does this by testing experimental foci versus null models sampled from a data-driven, biased probability distribution of finding foci at any cerebellar location. Cerebellar mappings were made across five BrainMap task domains and thirty-five subdomains, illustrating improved specificity of the new method. Twelve of forty (sub)domains reached convergence in specific cerebellar subregions, supporting dual motor representations and placing cognition in posterior-lateral regions. Repeated subsampling revealed that whereas action, language and working memory were relatively stable, other behaviors produced unstable meta-analytic maps. Lastly, meta-analytic connectivity modeling in the same debiased framework was used to reveal coactivation networks of cerebellar behavioral clusters. In sum, we created a new method for cerebellar meta-analysis that accounts for data biases and can be flexibly adapted to any part of the brain. Our findings provide a refined understanding of cerebellar involvement in human behaviors, highlighting regions for future investigation in both basic and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

The genomic revolution has enabled a rapid expansion of our knowledge of genomes in many living organisms, and most of that knowledge is classified and readily available in the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The genomesizeR tool leverages the wealth of taxonomic and genomic information present in NCBI databases to infer the genome size of Archeae, Bacteria, or Eukaryote organisms identified at any taxonomic level. This R package uses statistical modelling on data from the most up-to-date NCBI databases and provides three statistical methods for genome size prediction of a given taxon, or group of taxa. A straightforward  weighted mean method identifies the closest taxa with available genome size information in the taxonomic tree, and averages their genome sizes using weights based on taxonomic distance. A frequentist random effect model uses nested genus and family information to output genome size estimates. Finally a third option provides predictions from a distributional Bayesian multilevel model which uses taxonomic information from genus all the way to superkingdom, therefore providing estimates and uncertainty bounds even for under-represented taxa.

All three methods use:

O_LIA list of queries; a query being a taxon or a list of several taxa. The package was designed to make it easy to use with data coming from environmental DNA experiments, but works with any table of taxa.

Their DNA-Binding Domain (DBD) contains a B3 domain that allows base-specific interactions with Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs) in DNA target sites. Land plants encode three phylogenetically distinct ARF classes: the closely related A- and B-classes have overlapping DNA binding properties, contrasting with the different DNA-binding properties of the divergent C-class ARFs. ARF DNA-binding divergence likely occurred early in the evolution of the gene family, but the molecular determinants underlying it remain unclear. Here, we show that the B3 DNA-binding residues are deeply conserved in ARFs, and variability within these is only present in tracheophytes, correlating with greatly expanded ARF families. Using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, we confirm the essential role of conserved DNA-contacting residues for ARF function. We further show that ARF B3-AuxRE interfaces are not mutation-tolerant, suggesting low evolvability that has led to the ultra-conservation of the B3-DNA interface between ARF classes. Our data support the almost complete interchangeability between A/B-class ARF B3 by performing interspecies domain swaps, even between lineages that diverged over half a billion years ago. Our analysis further suggests that DNA-binding specificity diverged early during ARF evolution in a common streptophyte ancestor, followed by strong selection as part of a competition-based auxin response system","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Commonly used structure-based methods such as giga-docking often fail to rank compounds effectively, and free energy-based approaches, while accurate, are too computationally intensive for large-scale screening. Existing deep learning models struggle to generalize to new targets or drugs, and current evaluation methods do not reflect real-world performance accurately. We introduce BALM, a deep learning framework that predicts binding affinity using pretrained protein and ligand language models. BALM learns experimental binding affinities by optimizing cosine similarity in a shared embedding space. We also propose improved evaluation strategies with diverse data splits and metrics to better assess model performance. Using the BindingDB dataset, BALM shows strong generalization to unseen drugs, scaffolds, and targets. It excels in few-shot scenarios for targets such as USP7 and Mpro, outperforming traditional machine learning and docking methods, including AutoDock Vina. Adoption of the target-based evaluation methods proposed will allow for more stringent evaluation of machine learning-based scoring tools. Frameworks such as BALM show good performance, are computationally efficient, and are highly adaptable within this evaluation setting, making them practical tools for early-stage drug discovery screening.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Major advancements in SCP methodologies have been introduced in recent years, providing highly sensitive sample preparation methods and mass spectrometric technologies.

To enhance the depth, accuracy, and throughput of SCP for tumor analysis, we developed an automated, high-throughput pipeline that enables the analysis of 1,536 single cells in a single experiment. This approach integrates low-volume sample preparation, automated sample purification, and LC-MS analysis with the Slice-PASEF method. Integration of these methodologies into a streamlined pipeline led to a robust and reproducible identification of more than 3000 proteins per cell. We applied this pipeline to analyze tumor macrophages in a murine lung metastasis model. We identified over 1,800 proteins per cell, including key macrophage markers and [~]500 differentially expressed proteins between tumor and control macrophages. PCA analysis successfully separated these populations, revealing the utility of SCP in capturing biologically relevant signals in the tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable pipeline poised to advance single-cell proteomics in cancer research.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Telomeric repeat motifs (TRMs), the minimal repeating unit of a telomere, vary from species to species, with some evolutionary clades experiencing a rapid sequence divergence. To explore the full scope of this evolutionary divergence, many bioinformatic tools have been developed to infer novel TRMs using repetitive sequence search on short sequencing reads. However, novel telomeric motifs remain unidentified in up to half of the sequencing libraries assayed with these tools. A possible reason may be that short reads, derived from extensively sheared DNA, preserve little to no positional context of the repetitive sequences assayed. On the other hand, if a sequencing read is sufficiently long, telomeric sequences must appear at either end rather than in the middle. The TeloSearchLR algorithm relies on this to help identify novel TRMs on long reads, in many cases where short-read search tools have failed. In addition, we demonstrate that TeloSearchLR can reveal unusually long telomeric motifs not maintained by telomerase, and it can also be used to anchor terminal scaffolds in new genome assemblies.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Larval settlement is of considerable interest both for ecologists and for evolutionary biologists, who have proposed that anterior sensory systems for substrate selection provided the basis for animal brains. Nevertheless the cellular and molecular regulation of larval settlement, including in Cnidaria (corals, jellyfish, sea anemones, hydroids) is not well understood. We generated and compared anterior (aboral) transcriptomes and single-cell RNA-seq datasets from the planula larvae of three cnidarian species: the hydrozoan jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, and the scleractinian corals Astroides calycularis and Pocillopora acuta. Integrating these datasets and characterizing aboral cell types, we defined a common cellular architecture of the planula aboral end, and identified clade-specific specializations in cell types, including unique aboral neural cells in the Clytia planula and neurosecretory cell types with distinct molecular signatures in both Clytia and coral planulae. Among common planula aboral features were genes implicated in taurine uptake and catabolism expressed in distinct specialized cell types. In functional assays, exogenous taurine inhibited settlement of both Clytia and Astroides planulae. These findings define a detailed molecular and cellular framework of the planula aboral pole, and implicate localized taurine destruction in defining settlement competence.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered during flight like a flag in the wind. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs.

In this work, we investigate how RNA-phospholipid membrane interactions occur, by means of all-atom simulations. We find that among the four RNA nucleobases guanine exhibits the strongest interaction with the membrane due to extensive hydrogen bond formation. Additionally, we show that intra-RNA base pairing present in organised RNA structures significantly hinders RNA binding to the membrane.

The process is initiated by cell-surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that perceive pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and evoke a series of early cellular responses including calcium ions (Ca2+) influx, and is conducted by the intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich-repeat receptors (NLRs) ADR1s within an EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 module. However, the underlying mechanisms linking PRR signaling to the NLRs ADR1s remain unclear. Here, we show that the Nicotiana benthamiana Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-only protein Stomatal TIR1 (STIR1) produces the immune molecule pRib-AMP, induces formation of EDS1-PAD4-ADR1 complexes, and mediates stomatal immunity. The Inhibitor of Stomatal Immunity C2-domain protein 1 (ISIC1) interacts with and constrains STIR1 function at basal condition, whereas upon pathogen infection, ISIC1 senses Ca2+ signals and de-represses STIR1 signaling. Cryo-electron microscopy structure of pathogen infection-elicited Arabidopsis AtEDS1-AtPAD4-AtADR1-L2 complex reveals the pRib-AMP binding to AtEDS1-AtPAD4 receptor and the AtADR1-L2 recognition of pRib-AMP-AtPAD4-AtEDS1 for stomatal immunity.

It is used in many algorithms and data structures analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. In a minimizers scheme, the smallest k-mer by some predefined order is selected as the representative of a sequence window containing w consecutive k-mers, which results in overlapping windows often selecting the same k-mer. Minimizers that achieve the smallest number of selected k-mers over a random DNA sequence, termed the expected density, are desired for improved performance of high-throughput sequencing analyses. Yet, no method to date exists to generate minimizers that achieve minimum expected density. Moreover, existing selection schemes fail to achieve low density for values of k and w that are most practical for high-throughput sequencing algorithms and data structures. Here, we present GreedyMini, a novel greedy algorithm to generate minimizers with low expected density. Moreover, we present innovative techniques to transform minimizers from binary to larger alphabets and to larger k values, an extension of GreedyMini to generate minimizers that achieve low density for a particular DNA sequence, and efficient methods to calculate the exact expected density. We combine these innovations into GreedyMini+, a novel method to generate DNA minimizers for practical values of k and w. We demonstrate over various combinations of practical k and w values that GreedyMini+ generates minimizers that achieve expected densities very close to a recent theoretical lower bound, and both expected and particular densities much lower compared to existing selection schemes.

To address these issues, GENCODE has undertaken the most comprehensive lncRNAs annotation effort to date. This is founded on the manual annotation of full-length targeted long-read sequencing, on matched embryonic and adult tissues, of orthologous regions in human and mouse.

Novel gene annotations display evolutionary constraints, have well-formed promoter regions, and link to phenotype-associated genetic variants. They greatly enhance the functional interpretability of the human genome, as they help explain millions of previously-mapped ""orphan"" omics measurements corresponding to transcription start sites, chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding sites. Crucially, our targeted design assigned human-mouse orthologs at a rate beyond previous studies, tripling the number of human disease-associated lncRNAs with mouse orthologs.

In this study, six prominent MS/MS search tools, Mascot, MaxQuant, SpectroMine, FragPipe, Byos, and PEAKS, were systematically benchmarked for their performance on complex samples spiked with isotopically labeled proteins from Chinese hamster ovary cells, using trapped ion mobility spectrometry and parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation in data-dependent acquisition mode. Key performance metrics, including peptide and protein identifications, data extraction precision, fold-change accuracy, linearity, and measurement trueness, were evaluated. A Bayesian modeling framework with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling was employed to robustly estimate fold-change means and variances, alongside local false discovery rates through posterior probability calibration. Bayesian decision theory, implemented via expected utility maximization, was used to balance accuracy against posterior uncertainty, providing a probabilistic assessment of each tools performance. Through this cumulative analysis, variability across tools was observed: some excelled in identification sensitivity and protein coverage, others in quantitative accuracy with minimal bias, and a few offered balanced performance across metrics.

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

How cell type diversification is constrained by the stable separation between families over vast evolutionary times remains unknown. Here, integrating single-nucleus multiomic sequencing and deep learning, we show that hundreds of sequence features (motifs) divide into distinct sets associated with accessible genomes of specific cell type families. This division is conserved across highly divergent, early-branching animals including flatworms and cnidarians. While specific interactions between motifs delineate cell type relationships within families, surprisingly, these interactions are not conserved between species. Consistently, while deep learning models trained on one species can predict accessibility of other species sequences, their predictions frequently rely on distinct, but synonymous, motif combinations. We propose that long-term stability of cell type families is maintained through genome access specified by conserved motif sets, or  vocabularies, whereas cell types diversify through flexible use of motifs within each set.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

IME has been noted across diverse genes and organisms, but remains mysterious in many respects. For example, how does intron sequence affect the magnitude of IME? In this study, we performed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to assess the effect of varying intron sequence on gene expression in a high-throughput manner, in human cells, using tens of thousands of synthetic introns with natural splice sites and randomized internal sequence. We observe that most random introns splice efficiently and enhance gene expression as well as or better than fully natural introns. Nearly all introns stimulate gene expression [~]eight-fold above an intronless control, at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting that the primary mechanism acts to increase mRNA levels. IME strength is positively associated with splicing efficiency and with the intronic content of poly-uridine stretches, which we confirm using reporter experiments. Together, this work elucidates sequence determinants of IME from tens of thousands of random introns, and confirms that enhancement of gene expression is a general property of splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Base-level errors are typically fixed with an additional polishing step that uses reads aligned to the draft assembly to identify necessary edits. However, current methods struggle to find a balance between over- and under-polishing. Here, we present an encoder-only transformer model for assembly polishing called DeepPolisher, which predicts corrections to the underlying sequence using Pacbio HiFi read alignments to a diploid assembly. Our pipeline introduces a method, PHARAOH (Phasing Reads in Areas Of Homozygosity), which uses ultra-long ONT data to ensure alignments are accurately phased and to correctly introduce heterozygous edits in falsely homozygous regions. We demonstrate that the DeepPolisher pipeline can reduce assembly errors by half, with a greater than 70% reduction in indel errors. We have applied our DeepPolisher-based pipeline to 180 assemblies from the next Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) data release, producing an average predicted Quality Value (QV) improvement of 3.4 (54% error reduction) for the majority of the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Current high-throughput DNA synthesis technologies rely on intricate chip manufacturing and microfluidic systems to provide large-scale synthetic oligonucleotides, at the expense of low concentration and limited compatibility in the processing of longer DNA constructs assembly. Here, we report a microchip-based massive in parallel synthesis (mMPS), pioneering an ""identification-sorting-synthesis-recycling"" iteration mechanism to microchips for high throughput DNA synthesis. In comparison to microarray-based methods, we demonstrate that our method can increase the DNA product concentration by 4 magnitudes (to picomole-scale per sequence) and greatly simplifies the downstream processes for large-scale gene synthesis construction. By the construction of 1.97 million-diversity variant libraries that cover 1,254 human protein domains, we demonstrated the uniformity of the constructed variant libraries using mMPS-derived oligos is greatly improved, with amino acid distribution highly consistent as designed. In addition, by synthesizing 285 1kb-to-3kb genes with varying degrees of sequence complexity from previously reported strains A501 and 3DAC, potential ancestor of early archaea and bacteria, our result shows that the overall gene assembly success rate using mMPS-derived oligos is increased by 10-fold in comparison to other methods. Our mMPS technology holds the potential to close the gap between the quality and cost of writing DNA in increasing demand across many sectors of research and industrial activities.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240

Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1730844557240

ObjectiveThis study aimed to verify the association between SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of Stroke, based on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, in order to assess the inclusion of the virus as a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases.

MethodsA metaumbrella was conducted, which included 34 systematic reviews, of which 4 were selected for the final analysis based on methodological quality and consistency. The analysis aggregated the results of 70 primary studies, considering different stroke subtypes and outcomes associated with COVID-19. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the I{superscript 2} index, and significance bias was verified using Eggers test.

ResultsThe analysis showed that the severity of COVID-19 is significantly associated with an increased risk of stroke (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 1.55 - 3.95), particularly for ischemic stroke (eOR = 1.76; 95%CI: 1.11 - 2.80) and hemorrhagic stroke (eOR = 3.86; 95%CI: 1.79 - 8.33). Additionally, patients with cerebrovascular comorbidities had higher mortality (eOR = 2.48; 95%CI: 2.48 - 19.63), as did those who had previously suffered a stroke (eOR = 6.08; 95%CI: 3.73 - 9.91).

ConclusionThe association between SARS-CoV-2 and stroke was consistent and significant, suggesting that COVID-19 should be considered a new risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. However, the high heterogeneity among the studies analyzed reinforces the need for further research to consolidate this relationship.","NA","medrxiv",1730844557240
