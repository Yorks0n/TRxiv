We previously showed that a cyst nematode virulence effector SPRYSEC15 (SS15) binds and inhibits oligomerisation of helper NLR proteins in the expanded NRC1/2/3 clade by preventing intramolecular rearrangements required for NRC oligomerisation into an activated resistosome. Here we examined the degree to which NRC proteins from multiple Solanaceae species are sensitive to suppression by SS15 and tested hypotheses about adaptive evolution of the binding interface between the SS15 inhibitor and NRC proteins. Whereas all tested orthologs of NRC2 were inhibited by SS15, some natural variants of NRC1 and NRC3 are insensitive to SS15 suppression. Ancestral sequence reconstruction combined with functional assays revealed that NRC3 transitioned from an ancestral suppressed form to an insensitive one over 19 million years ago. Our analyses revealed the evolutionary trajectory of coevolution between a parasite inhibitor and its NLR immune receptor target, identifying key evolutionary transitions in helper NLRs that counteract this inhibition. This work reveals a distinct type of gene-for-gene interaction between parasite or pathogen immunosuppressors and host immune receptors that contrasts with the coevolution between AVR effectors and immune receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy. Design and Methods: Scopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group). Results: 122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses. Conclusions: BMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1718661929826

The brain's capacity to enact this sequence over decades indicates that it relies on intrinsic mechanisms to regulate inter-regional differences in the timing of cortical maturation, yet regulators of human developmental chronology are not well understood. Given evidence from animal models that thalamic axons modulate windows of cortical plasticity, here we evaluate the overarching hypothesis that structural connections between the thalamus and cortex help to coordinate cortical maturational heterochronicity during youth. We first introduce, cortically annotate, and anatomically validate a new atlas of human thalamocortical connections using diffusion tractography. By applying this atlas to three independent youth datasets (ages 8-23 years; total N = 2,676), we reproducibly demonstrate that thalamocortical connections develop along a maturational gradient that aligns with the cortex's sensorimotor-association axis. Associative cortical regions with thalamic connections that take longest to mature exhibit protracted expression of neurochemical, structural, and functional markers indicative of higher circuit plasticity as well as heightened environmental sensitivity. This work highlights a central role for the thalamus in the orchestration of hierarchically organized and environmentally sensitive windows of cortical developmental malleability.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

While protein localization in the thermophilic model archaeon S. acidocaldarius has been achieved using antibodies with fluorescent probes in fixed cells, the use of thermostable fluorescent proteins in thermophilic archaea has so far been unsuccessful. Given the significance of live protein localization in the field of archaeal cell biology, we aimed to identify fluorescent proteins for use in S. acidocaldarius. To achieve this, we expressed various previously published and optimized thermostable fluorescent proteins along with fusion proteins of interest and analyzed the cells using flow cytometry and (thermo-) fluorescent microscopy. Of the tested proteins, Thermal Green Protein (TGP) exhibited the brightest fluorescence when expressed in Sulfolobus cells. By optimizing the linker between TGP and a protein of interest, we could additionally successfully fuse proteins with minimal loss of fluorescence. TGP-CdvB and TGP-PCNA1 fusions displayed localization patterns consistent with previous immunolocalization experiments. These initial results in protein localization in S. acidocaldarius at high temperatures, combined with recent advancements in thermomicroscopy, open new avenues in the field of archaeal cell biology. This progress finally enables localization experiments in thermophilic archaea, which have so far been limited to mesophilic organisms.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Although the exact mechanisms underlying its maturation remain elusive, spontaneous activity patterns in the retina, known as retinal waves, have been shown to contribute to this developmental process. Retinal waves exhibit complex spatio-temporal statistics and contribute to the establishment of circuit connectivity and function in the visual system, including the formation of retinotopic maps and the refinement of receptive fields in downstream areas such as the thalamus and visual cortex. Recent work in mice has shown that retinal waves have statistical features matching those of natural visual stimuli, such as optic flow, suggesting that they could prime the visual system for motion processing upon vision onset. Motivated by these findings, we examined whether artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural movies show improved performance if pre-trained with retinal waves. We employed the spatio-temporally complex task of next-frame prediction, in which the ANN was trained to predict the next frame based on preceding input frames of a movie. We found that pre-training ANNs with retinal waves enhances the processing of real-world visual stimuli and accelerates learning. Strikingly, even when matching the total training time by merely replacing initial training epochs on naturalistic stimuli with exposure to retinal waves, an ANN trained on retinal waves temporarily outperforms one trained solely on natural movies. Similar to observations made in biological systems, we also found that pre-training with spontaneous activity refines the receptive field of ANN neurons. Overall, our work sheds light on the functional role of spatio-temporally patterned spontaneous activity in the processing of motion in natural scenes, suggesting it acts as a training signal to prepare the developing visual system for adult visual processing.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1718661929826

Using the markerless pose estimation software DeepLabCut, we three-dimensionally track the body of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile. Using these extracted markers, we developed an algorithm which computationally reconstructs the ant's body, directly measuring volumetric change over time. Moreover, we provide measures of accuracy and quantify the ant's feeding response to a range of sucrose concentrations, as well as a gradient of caffeine-laced sucrose solutions. Small invertebrates are often prolific invasive species and disease vectors, causing significant ecological and economical damage.

However, such highly dynamic, viscoelastic, mesoscopic, intracellular membraneless bodies can undergo aberrant liquid-to-solid transitions into a range of amyloid-like species. The formation of such pathological assemblies necessitates their clearance by the cellular protein quality control machinery comprising molecular chaperones. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying the chaperone-mediated regulation of protein homeostasis within biomolecular condensates remains elusive. Here, we present a unique case demonstrating that a heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), Ydj1, promotes the heterotypic phase separation of intrinsically disordered tau via intermolecular electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Through a diverse array of tools involving high-resolution fluorescence imaging, single-droplet steady-state and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and single-molecule FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer), we elucidate the diverse structural conformations of tau present within phase-separated heterotypic condensates that are otherwise predisposed to aggregation. Our vibrational Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy data show that the presence of Ydj1 in tau-Ydj1 condensates abolishes the formation of amyloid fibrils, unlike tau-only droplets. By sequentially deleting segments, we identify amyloidogenic hexapeptide motifs located in the hydrophobic microtubule-binding region of tau that foster contacts with the peptide-binding regions of Ydj1, promoting the formation of tau-Ydj1 binary condensates. Additionally, we show that the underlying network of interactions governing these condensates can be further tuned by RNA. Our results underscore an intriguing interplay of molecular drivers that govern chaperone-associated phase separation, with broader implications for the chaperoning of a wide range of intrinsically disordered proteins involved in physiology and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Larvae of some Cerambycidae groups have mycetomes, accessory organs associated with the midgut that harbor fungal symbiont cells. The symbionts are thought to improve nutrient conditions; however, this has yet to be shown experimentally. To deduce the evolutionary history of this symbiosis, we investigated the characteristics of the mycetomes in the larvae of longicorn beetles collected in Japan. Lepturinae, Necydalinae, and Spondylidinae are the only groups that possess mycetomes, and these three groups mycetomes and corresponding fungal cells exhibit different characteristics between the groups. However, the phylogenetic relationship of symbiont yeasts does not coincide with that of the corresponding longicorn beetle species, suggesting they have not co-speciated. The imperfect vertical transmission of symbiont yeasts from female to offspring is a mechanism that could accommodate the host-symbiont phylogenetic incongruence. Some Lepturinae species secondarily lost mycetomes. The loss is associated with their diet choice, suggesting that different conditions between feeding habits could have allowed species to discard this organ. We found that symbiont fungi encapsulated in the mycetomes are dispensable for larval growth if sufficient nutrients are given, suggesting that the role of symbiotic fungi could be compensated by the food larvae take. Aegosoma sinicum is a longicorn beetle classified to the subfamily Prioninae, which does not possess mycetomes. However, this species contains a restricted selection of yeast species in the larval gut, suggesting that the symbiosis between longicorn beetles and yeasts emerged before acquiring the mycetomes.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

These chromosomes are delayed in congression to the metaphase plate and prone to segregation errors. Yet, their mechanism of congression remains elusive. By using stimulated emission depletion (STED) and lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy, here we show that polar chromosomes require a unique congression step to transit across the spindle pole. This step occurs independently of the known congression drivers, including CENP-E, kinetochore dynein, chromokinesins, and actomyosin. Instead, it relies on the pivoting of chromosome-carrying astral microtubules around the centrosome towards the spindle surface. During pivoting, polar chromosomes form complex attachments with astral microtubules that persist throughout the process. By altering the kinesin-5 Eg5/KIF11 activity to reverse, restore, or block spindle elongation, we show that spindle elongation drives the pivoting and dictates its direction and magnitude. We reveal impaired spindle elongation as a major cause of congression defects and segregation errors of polar chromosomes in RPE1 cells after Mps1 kinase inhibition, and in the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma OVSAHO cells. Increasing spindle elongation efficiency by depleting the kinesin-4 KIF4A rescued polar chromosomes in OVSAHO cells, supporting the causal relationship between spindle elongation and resolution of polar chromosomes. We conclude that polar chromosomes depend on spindle elongation to propel the pivoting of their astral microtubules, enabling their contact with the spindle surface, congression, and proper segregation. In the context of disease, our findings suggest that altering spindle elongation has the potential to modify mitotic errors in certain cancer cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

These changes were associated with transcriptional and protein remodeling of neurotrophic signaling and synaptic integrity, partially due to the CNS-targeting myokine prosaposin (PSAP). DISCUSSION: Our findings implicate the muscle-to-brain axis as a novel neuroprotective pathway against amyloid pathogenesis in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

As many signalling centres are decommissioned before the end of embryogenesis, a fundamental question is how signalling centres can be re-induced later in life to promote regeneration after injury. Here, we use the axolotl salamander model (Ambystoma mexicanum) to address how the floor plate is assembled for spinal cord regeneration. The floor plate is an archetypal vertebrate signalling centre that secretes Shh ligand and patterns neural progenitor cells during embryogenesis. Unlike mammals, axolotls continue to express floor plate genes (including Shh) and downstream dorsal-ventral patterning genes in their spinal cord throughout life, including at steady state. The parsimonious hypothesis that Shh+ cells give rise to functional floor plate cells for regeneration had not been tested. Using HCR in situ hybridisation and mathematical modelling, we first quantitated the behaviours of dorsal-ventral spinal cord domains, identifying significant increases in gene expression level and floor plate size during regeneration. Next, we established a transgenic axolotl to specifically label and fate map Shh+ cells in vivo. We found that labelled Shh+ cells gave rise to regeneration floor plate, and not to other neural progenitor domains, after tail amputation. Thus, despite changes in domain size and downstream patterning gene expression, Shh+ cells retain their floor plate identity during regeneration, acting as a stable cellular source for this regeneration signalling centre in the axolotl spinal cord.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Polyamines are an abundant class of aliphatic molecules that play essential roles in fundamental cellular processes across the tree of life. Surprisingly, the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to polyamines encountered during infection, and acquisition of a polyamine resistance locus has been implicated in spread of the prominent USA300 methicillin-resistant S. aureus lineage. At present, alternative pathways of polyamine resistance in staphylococci are largely unknown. Here we applied experimental evolution to identify novel mechanisms and consequences of S. aureus adaption when exposed to increasing concentrations of the polyamine spermine. Evolved populations of S. aureus exhibited striking evidence of parallel adaptation, accumulating independent mutations in the potassium transporter genes ktrA and ktrD. Mutations in either ktrA or ktrD are sufficient to confer polyamine resistance and function in an additive manner. Moreover, we find that ktr mutations provide increased resistance to multiple classes of unrelated cationic antibiotics, suggesting a common mechanism of resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, ktr mutants exhibit alterations in cell surface charge indicative of reduced affinity and uptake of cationic molecules. Finally, we observe that laboratory-evolved ktr mutations are also present in diverse natural S. aureus isolates, suggesting these mutations may contribute to antimicrobial resistance during human infections. Collectively this study identifies a new role for potassium transport in S. aureus polyamine resistance with consequences for susceptibility to both host-derived and clinically-used antimicrobials.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

We studied 2286 neurons recorded from the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex of 29 intracranially-implanted patients during a full-length movie. While few neurons responded preferentially to semantic features, we could reliably predict the presence of characters, location, and visual transitions from the neuronal populations using a recurrent neural network. We show that decoding performance differs across regions based on the feature category, and that the performance is driven by feature-selective single neurons when decoding visual transitions such as camera cuts. These findings suggest that semantic representation in the MTL varies based on semantic category, with decoding information embedded in specific subsets of neurons for event-related features or distributed across the entire population for character and location-related features.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Responses to sub-lethal abiotic stress combinations are complex and often distinct from responses to individual stresses and remain poorly understood. Investigating traits and molecular factors mediating acclimation to stress combinations is essential for the development of climate change-resilient field crops. Here, we studied the morphological, physiological, and molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to i) co-occurring high temperature and drought and ii) flooding sequentially followed by drought, both of which have increased in frequency due to climate change. A set of 15 physiological and morphological traits were assessed during single and combined stresses. By combining these comprehensive trait analyses with transcriptome characterization, we established the generally additive effects of simultaneous or sequential stresses on plant morphology and physiology compared to the corresponding individual stresses. Although drought had a mild effect in both stress combinations, a unique transcriptome signature emerged upon combination with high temperature simultaneously or flooding sequentially. Molecular processes identified as important for multi-stress resilience included plastid-nucleus communication, ABA signaling and photo-acclimation. Based on the RNA-seq data, a set of 39 genes was identified as potential multi-stress response regulators. Mutants were tested to validate their contribution to plant survival and phenotypic acclimation under combined stress. We confirmed the involvement of several genes in regulating phenotypic acclimation traits. Among the novel identified factors are EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) and ARABIDOPSIS TOXICOS EN LEVADURA (ATL80), with significant effects on plant growth, leaf development and plant survival (wilting) during high-temperature drought and post-submergence drought respectively.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Here, we study the role of biomolecular condensates on irreversible RNA clustering. We find that physiologically relevant and disease-associated repeat RNAs spontaneously undergo an age-dependent percolation transition inside multi-component protein-nucleic acid condensates to form nanoscale clusters. Homotypic RNA clusters drive the emergence of multiphasic condensate structures with an RNA-rich solid core surrounded by an RNA-depleted fluid shell. The timescale of the RNA clustering, which drives a liquid-to-solid transition of biomolecular condensates, is determined by the sequence features, stability of RNA secondary structure, and repeat length. Importantly, G3BP1, the core scaffold of stress granules, introduces heterotypic buffering to homotypic RNA-RNA interactions and impedes intra-condensate RNA clustering in an ATP-independent manner. Our work suggests that biomolecular condensates can act as sites for RNA aggregation. It also highlights the functional role of RNA-binding proteins in suppressing aberrant RNA phase transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

We developed a novel deep learning-based method to generate dense 3D segmentations rapidly from sparse 2D annotations of a few objects on single sections. Models trained on the rapidly generated segmentations achieved similar accuracy as those trained on expert dense ground-truth annotations. Human time to generate annotations was reduced by three orders of magnitude and could be produced by non-expert annotators.

We conjecture that the competitive environment of a football game leads to movement dynamics reminiscent of that observed in hunter-gathering populations and more broadly in any biological organisms foraging for resources, whose exact distribution is unknown to them. Apart from analyzing individual players' movements, we investigate the dynamics of the whole team by studying the movements of its center of mass (team's centroid). Remarkably, the trajectory of the centroid also exhibits Levy walk properties, which implies the presence of team-level coordination.

We present a comparative analysis of five reference quality genomes, including four de novo assemblies, covering all major chiton clades: Lepidopleurida (Deshayesiella sirenkoi), Callochitonida (Callochiton septemvalvis) and Chitonida (Acanthochitona discrepans and A. rubrolineata), and an updated phylogeny for the phylum.

Two congeners each have 8 haploid chromosomes, results of two independent fusion events from the karyotype of their most recent common ancestor. The largest number of novel fusions is in the supposedly most plesiomorphic clade Lepidopleurida, and the chitonid Liolophura japonica has a partial genome duplication, extending the known occurrence of large-scale gene duplication within Mollusca. The extreme and dynamic genome rearrangements in this class stands in contrast to most other animals and is not explained by accumulated change since the deep divergence time of this clade.

One promising avenue to resolve the genetic basis of complex traits is through evolve-and-resequence experiments, in which laboratory populations are exposed to some selective pressure and trait-contributing loci are identified by extreme frequency changes over the course of the experiment. However, small laboratory populations will experience substantial random genetic drift, and it is difficult to determine whether selection played a roll in a given allele frequency change. Predicting how much allele frequencies change under drift and selection had remained an open problem well into the 21st century, even those contributing to simple, monogenic traits. Recently, there have been efforts to apply the path integral, a method borrowed from physics, to solve this problem. So far, this approach has been limited to genic selection, and is therefore inadequate to capture the complexity of quantitative, highly polygenic traits that are commonly studied. Here we extend one of these path integral methods, the perturbation approximation, to selection scenarios that are of interest to quantitative genetics. In particular, we derive analytic expressions for the transition probability (i.e., the probability that an allele will change in frequency from x, to y in time t) of an allele contributing to a trait subject to stabilizing selection, as well as that of an allele contributing to a trait rapidly adapting to a new phenotypic optimum. We use these expressions to characterize the use of allele frequency change to test for selection, as well as explore optimal design choices for evolve-and-resequence experiments to uncover the genetic architecture of polygenic traits under selection.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Ten species were identified based on specific historical uses presumably linked with the treatment of viral infections as well as inflammatory conditions. For each plant candidate, aqueous and hydroethanolic extracts have been produced. CellTiter-Glo(R) Luminescent Cell Viability Assay was used to assess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and the effect on cell viability of the extracts.

Of the ten plant species tested, four displayed an antiviral activity [&ge;] 50% at 16.7 {micro}g/ml with acceptable cell viability (> 75%): Sambucus nigra L. (leaves), Viola odorata L. (leaves), Geranium robertianum L. (arial parts) and Artemisia vulgaris L. (aerial parts). The crude extracts were partitioned in aqueous and organic fractions and further analyzed. The ethyl acetate fractions of S. nigra, V. odorata and G. robertianum expressed significant antiviral activity of nearly 100% at 5.6 {micro}g/ml (P < 0.05). The most potent inhibitory activity was observed for the ethyl acetate fraction of Viola odorata L. (leaves) with 87% at 1.9 {micro}g/ml (P < 0.0001). Alongside bioactivity analysis phytochemical fingerprints were made, with the aim to understand important substance classes contained. Further investigations are required to explore the active principles.

Our study shows that an ethnopharmacological approach based on historical records of traditional use to select potential herbal candidates coupled with a rational screening process enables an efficient search for plant-derived natural products with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Recent studies have highlighted that bacteria possess a large, rapidly changing arsenal of defense genes and that viruses can neutralize at least some of these genes with matching anti-defenses. However, a broadly applicable approach for discovering the genetic underpinnings of such interactions is missing since typically used methods such as comparative genomics are limited by the rampant horizontal gene transfer and poor annotation of viral and bacterial genes. Here we show that genes that allow the viruses to overcome bacterial defenses can be systematically identified using an interpretable machine-learning approach even when using diverse bacteria-virus infection data. To verify the predictions, we experimentally characterized eight previously unknown anti-defense proteins in viruses specific for Vibrio bacteria and showed that they counteract a wide range of bacterial immune systems, including AbiH, AbiU, Septu, DRT, CBASS, and Retron. The power of our computational approach is highlighted by the identification of anti-defense proteins that inhibit non-homologous defense systems, which we verify for Retron and AbiH. We suggest that the computational prediction based on experimental interactions offers a promising avenue to unravel the genetic mechanisms of co-evolution between bacteria and their viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Bacteria which consistently colonise roots of specific plants across distinct environments, known as that plants core root microbiome, are particularly promising due to their colonisation competency. However, traditional, culture-based techniques can overlook promising PGPB which do not display commonly screened for plant growth promoting traits. Although numerous studies have isolated beneficial root bacteria, few have combined bacterial metabarcoding with culture-based techniques to identify novel biofertiliser candidates. In a two-pronged approach, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to define the core root microbiome of the model cereal plant, Brachypodium distachyon, grown in four distinct soils. From 7,042 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected in root fractions, only 40 ASVs were common at a prevalence of 80%. Core ASVs primarily belonged to the class Alphaproteobacteria, with the remainder comprising Actinobacteria, Bacilli, Chloroflexia, Gammaproteobacteria and Negativicutes. Secondly, B. distachyon root-associated bacterial strains were isolated from plants grown in the aforementioned soils. Of 207 root-associated isolates, 10 were identified as members of the core root microbiome, with the majority not displaying commonly screened for plant growth promoting traits. However, in a semi-hydroponic system, a core Bacillus and Rhodococcus strain significantly increased B. distachyon shoot dry weight by 32.8% and 40.0%, respectively. Additionally, two core Bacillus strains significantly increased root dry weight by 79.7 and 52.3%. This study demonstrates the potential of incorporating additional criteria afforded by culture-independent methods to screen for novel biofertiliser candidates typically overlooked by culture-dependent techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Many baboons successfully learned this conditional match-to-sample task for both noiseless and noisy plots.

Numerous studies have revealed that flavonoids play a central role in plant acclimation to abiotic factors like low temperature or high light, but their structural and functional diversity frequently prevents a detailed mechanistic understanding. Further complexity in analysing flavonoid metabolism arises from the different subcellular compartments which are involved in biosynthesis and storage. In the present study, non-aqueous fractionation of Arabidopsis leaf tissue was combined with metabolomics and proteomics analysis to reveal subcellular regulation during cold acclimation in two flavonoid-deficient mutants. During the first three days of a two-week cold acclimation period, flavonoid deficiency was observed to affect pyruvate, citrate and glutamate metabolism which indicated a role in stabilising C/N metabolism and photosynthesis. Also, tetrahydrofolate metabolism was found to be affected which had significant effects on regulation of the proteome of the photorespiratory pathway. In the late stage of cold acclimation, flavonoid deficiency was found to affect protein stability, folding and proteasomal degradation which resulted in a significant decrease of total protein amounts in both mutants. In summary, these findings suggest that flavonoid metabolism plays different roles in early and late stages of plant cold acclimation and significantly contributes to establishing a new protein homeostasis in a changing environment.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Within developing endochondral bones, chondrocytes at growth plate edges transition to osteoblasts, adipocytes, and other connective tissue in the marrow cavity, and in diseases such as Multiple Osteochondromas (MO) chondrocytes form abnormally around growth plates and contribute to ectopic bone. On the other hand, the inability to form new chondrocytes to maintain damaged joints contributes to the high incidence of osteoarthritis. In order to assess the ability of zebrafish to regenerate cartilage, we developed a nitroreductase-based cartilage ablation model. Following ablation at larval to adult stages, we observed new chondrocytes forming around the dead cartilage matrix, with cartilage outgrowths in ablated endochondral bones resembling the exostoses of MO. By generating a perichondrium-restricted hyal4:GFP transgenic line, we show that new chondrocytes arise from the perichondrium surrounding the ablated cartilage. In addition, we observe enriched expression of the retinoic acid (RA) synthesis gene aldh1a2 in the perichondrium following ablation, and the RA degrading enzyme gene cyp26b1 in newly forming chondrocytes. Consistent with RA signaling suppressing chondrogenesis, treatment with the RA receptor gamma agonist palovarotene, which has been used to treat MO, prevented ablation-induced chondrogenesis. Although we find that BMP signaling is also required for ablation-induced chondrogenesis, we show a distinct role for RA signaling in suppressing sox9a expression and chondrogenesis. Moreover, palovarotene resulted in a near complete loss of growth plates in uninjured zebrafish, which was due to the precocious dedifferentiation and exit of chondrocytes from the growth plate. Our findings suggest a common chondrocyte suppressive role of RA signaling within the developing growth plates and regenerating perichondrium, which may explain the growth plate defects observed when using RA agonists to treat MO.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Despite their diversity, different defense pathways share a modular organization, where numerous specificity factors identify diverse targets and common effectors silence them. In the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, which controls selfish elements in the metazoan germline, diverse target RNAs are first identified by complementary base pairing with piRNAs and then silenced by PIWI-clade nucleases via enzymatic cleavage. Such a binary architecture allows the defense systems to be readily adaptable, where new targets can be captured via the innovation of new specificity factors. Thus, our current understanding of genome defense against lineage-specific selfish genes has been largely limited to the evolution of specificity factors, while it remains poorly understood whether other types of innovations are required. Here, we describe a new type of innovation, which escalates the defense capacity of the piRNA pathway to control a recently expanded selfish gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Through an in vivo RNAi screen for repressors of Stellate--a recently evolved and expanded selfish meiotic driver--we discovered a novel defense factor, Trailblazer. Trailblazer is a transcription factor that promotes the expression of two PIWI-clade nucleases, Aub and AGO3, to match Stellate in abundance. Recent innovation in the DNA-binding domain of Trailblazer enabled it to drastically elevate Aub and AGO3 expression in the D. melanogaster lineage, thereby escalating the silencing capacity of the piRNA pathway to control expanded Stellate and safeguard fertility. As copy-number expansion is a recurrent feature of diverse selfish genes across the tree of life, we envision that augmenting the defense capacity to quantitatively match selfish genes is likely a repeatedly employed defense strategy in evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929826

Participants experienced a stronger sense of ownership over a virtual hand when they viewed it from a 1PP compared to a 3PP. Furthermore, participants rated pain-inducing and pleasure-inducing stimuli as most unpleasant and pleasant, and as more intense. We observed distinct EEG patterns in early (N2, early posterior negativity- EPN) and late (late positive potential-LPP) event-related potentials, as well as in EEG power. The N2 and EPN components showed higher amplitudes for pain and pleasure stimuli compared to neutral stimuli particularly when seen from a 1PP. Conversely, the LPP component exhibited a smaller amplitude for pleasure stimuli compared to both pain and neutral stimuli. We also found that theta-band power increased and alpha power decreased for pain and pleasure stimuli viewed from a 1PP vs a 3PP perspective. Also, in the ultra-late time-window, we observed a decrease in theta, alpha, and beta-band power specifically associated with pleasure stimuli.

Whether obesity is associated with an increased risk of post-acute sequelae of SARS-Cov-2 infection (PASC) among pediatrics, independent of its impacts on acute infection severity, is unclear. OBJECTIVE To quantify the association between body mass index (BMI) status before SARS-CoV-2 infection and pediatric PASC risk, controlling for acute infection severity. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study occurred from March 2020 to May 2023, with a minimal follow-up of 179 days. SETTING Twenty-six US hospitals. PARTICIPANTS Individuals aged 5-20 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPOSURES Elevated BMI status assessed before infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES To identify PASC, we first used the ICD-10-CM code specific for post-COVID-19 conditions, and a second approach used clusters of symptoms and conditions that constitute the PASC phenotype. BMI was assessed within 18 months before infection; the measure closest to the index date was selected. Relative risk (RR) for BMI-PASC association was quantified by Poisson regression models, adjusting for sociodemographic, acute COVID severity, and other clinical factors. RESULTS Among the 172136 participants included, the median age of BMI assessment and cohort entry were 12.8 and 13.2 years, 1402 (0.8%) were identified as having PASC with the ICD-10-CM code, and 74317 (43.2%) had more than 1 incident occurrence of PASC symptoms and conditions. Compared with participants with a healthy weight, those who had overweight, obesity, and severe obesity had 4.7% (RR, 1.047; 95% CI, 0.868-1.263), 25.4% (RR, 1.254; 95% CI, 1.064-1.478) and 42.1% (RR, 1.421; 95% CI, 1.253-1.611) higher risk of PASC when identified using the diagnosis code, respectively. The risk for any occurrences of PASC symptoms and conditions also increased in overweight (RR, 1.030; 95% CI, 0.982-1.080), obesity (RR, 1.108; 95% CI, 1.064-1.154), and severe obesity (RR, 1.174; 95% CI, 1.138-1.213), and that for total incident occurrences increased, too, in overweight (RR, 1.053; 95% CI, 1.000-1.109), obesity (RR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.088-1.188), and severe obesity (RR, 1.182; 95% CI, 1.142-1.223). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Elevated BMI was associated with a significantly increased PASC risk in a dose-dependent manner. The biological mechanisms for this association should be investigated in future research.","NA","medrxiv",1718661929826

We identified a midazolam dose that allowed a conscious psychedelic experience to occur while partially impairing memory for the experience. Furthermore, midazolam dose and memory impairment tended to associate inversely with salience, insight, and well-being induced by psilocybin. These data suggest a role for memory in therapeutically relevant behavioral effects occasioned by psilocybin.

The pathological process evolves from acute phases predominantly driven by inflammation transitioning to progressive profiles where neurodegeneration takes precedence. It remains unresolved why this course is highly heterogeneous among patients. Currently we know that sex variable plays a crucial role in its understanding. Females are 2-3 times more likely to suffer from multiple sclerosis while males' progression is faster with greater severity. We investigate the potential molecular mechanisms underlying these sex-differential clinical traits analysing transcriptomic data at single cell resolution. 48,919 central nervous system and 336,934 peripheral immune cells, covering the multiple sclerosis spectrum, enabled us to provide the comprehensive landscape of sex differences by cell type. This includes signatures in gene expression patterns, functional profiling, pathways activation and cell-cell communication networks for females, males and their sex-differential profiles. Complete results can be explored in the user-friendly interactive webtool https://bioinfo.cipf.es/cbl-atlas-ms/. Among these findings, we unveiled that female neurons may exhibit protective mechanisms against excitotoxicity, glial cells dysregulated widely stress response genes in a sex-differential manner, and female oligodendrocytes increase expression of axon-myelin contact genes suggesting strong potential for myelin recovery. In the inflammatory-predominant forms, female immune cells present an inflammatory core driven by the AP-1 transcription factor, while male adaptive immune cells exhibit higher mitochondrial impairment. Conversely, larger differences are reported in CD8+ T cells, with females displaying homeostasis recovery patterns and males exhibiting cytolytic profiles.

In the present study, the mRNA transcriptome of phorbol ester (TPA) differentiated HL-60/S4 macrophage cells was scrutinized using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), which evaluates the strengths of various cellular phenotypes by examining the enrichment of functionally different gene sets. Employing GSEA, we obtained supporting evidence that HL-60/S4 macrophages are senescent, probably a consequence of enriched TGF{beta} and NOTCH signaling transcripts. There appears to be a reduction of transcripts for heterochromatin, nucleosome formation, and chromatin remodeling phenotypes. In addition, despite upregulated oxidative stress gene transcription, we observed a reduction of DNA damage and repair transcripts. GSEA indicated that transcripts for autophagy, extracellular matrix, and inflammation/inflammasomes are enriched. We also observed that the HL-60/S4 macrophage is enriched for apoptosis gene transcripts, which may promote necrotic death by pyroptosis. The long-term goal of this research direction is to see whether this complex multifaceted phenotypic pattern is shared with other types of macrophages and to determine what mechanisms might exist to coordinate these phenotypic facets within a single cell.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Tyrannosaurus rex top speeds have been examined using a wide range of methods that draw on more traditional biomechanical formulas, computer simulations, and allometric equations based on mass. However, these calculations may be made more precise using input from contemporary research on anatomy and biomechanics that account for mass allometry and scaling. This study builds on existing studies in anatomy, biomechanical data, and established equations for locomotion to calculate a muscular driven range of top speed for several (n=4) specimens that had sufficient data to undertake this work. When properly refined with additional data on muscle mass allometry and scaling, several adult specimens of T. rex could confidently be placed in a range of top speed from 7.7 to 10.5 m/s, and possibly up to 10.7 m/s. Additionally, a younger specimen of T. rex was analyzed and found to have a higher top speed than the adult T. rex at 6.3 to 14.5 m/s. Although the estimated top speeds in this study are slower than some previous estimates, these results find some support for slow running gaits and reinforce interpretations of T. rex as an active and effective apex predator. Future work can build upon this study by investigating how muscular driven top speeds may affect ontogenetic niche partitioning and prey species regularly targeted by adult T. rex.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Different fractions of the microbiome enter dynamic interactions, particularly bacteria and bacteriophages (phages) viruses preying on bacteria. Since the microbiome exists inside the human body, the body strongly affects the microbes, although not in a uniform way, but shaped by the extreme diversity of human genetic variants. These triadic dynamics of the bacterial microbiome, phageome, and human host genotype remain poorly understood; hence our goal in this study was to comprehend them as a holistic and interdependent system. Gastric biopsies were the source of the stomach microbiome (bacteria and phages). Genotyping of patients was conducted on blood samples. They were analyzed by next generation sequencing followed by multiway statistical comparisons of identified bacterial and phage taxa, human genetic variants, and medical data from the patients, including gastric disorder diagnostics. Commonly expected associations between presence of bacteriophages and their specific hosts were not found to be a universal principle. With comparable SNP correlations, the strongest associations between Staphylococcus and some staphylococcal phages or Enterobacteria and some enterobacteria phages were discovered. However, many more phage groups were not found to be clearly associated with their bacterial hosts, though often associated with SNPs, particularly those linked to immunological functions and body responses to bacteria and viruses. Thus, in addition to the expected effect on phage communities by shaping the communities of their bacterial hosts, the human body seems to affect phages directly, selecting for phages that survive its specific selective pressure, which can be defined by detection of particular genetic variants.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

However, interpreting these signals requires understanding their neural correlates. Parvalbumin (PV) interneurons are crucial in network activity, but their impact on CBF is not fully understood. Optogenetic studies show that stimulating cortical PV interneurons induces diverse CBF responses, including rapid increases, decreases, and slower delayed increases. To clarify this relationship, we measured hemodynamic and neural responses to optogenetic stimulation of PV interneurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 during evoked and ongoing resting-state activity in the somatosensory cortex of awake mice. Two-photon microscopy (2P) Ca2+ imaging showed robust activation of PV-positive (PV+) cells and inhibition of PV-negative (PV-) cells. Prolonged PV+ cell stimulation led to a delayed, slow CBF increase, resembling a secondary peak in the CBF response to whisker stimulation. 2P vessel diameter measurements revealed that PV+ cell stimulation induced rapid arterial vasodilation in superficial layers and delayed vasodilation in deeper layers. Ongoing activity recordings indicated that both PV+ and PV- cell populations modulate arterial fluctuations at rest, with PV+ cells having a greater impact. These findings show that PV interneurons generate a complex depth-dependent vascular response, dominated by slow vascular changes in deeper layers.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

While not all salmonids are sensitive to acute lethality caused by 6PPD-Q, its potency can vary by several orders of magnitude among fish species. The main driver(s) of species sensitivity differences is a pressing question, with one area of interest examining whether differences in their ability to biotransform and detoxify 6PPD-Q could be a driving factor. This study utilized liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to assess biotransformation and metabolome-wide effects of 6PPD-Q on early-life stage salmonids, including two sensitive species, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and one tolerant species, brown trout (Salmo trutta). Three phase I TPs and seven phase II TPs were detected, with differences in peak areas revealing that brown trout had the greatest ability to detoxify 6PPD-Q. TP-OH1, an alkyl sidechain monohydroxylated TP, was detected in both rainbow and lake trout but not in brown trout, with more research needed to understand potential TP-OH1 mediated toxicity. Several endogenous metabolites were found to be dysregulated in rainbow and lake trout, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction and altered metabolism. Results of this study indicate a difference in the biotransformation capability of 6PPD-Q among salmonid fish species and subsequent unique metabolome responses.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Previous studies have identified a number of nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways that could interpret metabolic input to regulate rhythmic hepatic biology. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification (PTM) in mediating metabolic regulation of rhythmic biology in the liver. We observed daily oscillation of global nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation in the liver of mice subjected to natural nighttime-restricted feeding (NRF). O-GlcNAcomic analysis revealed that 11.54% of 719 O-GlcNAcylated proteins are rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated over a 24-hour day-night cycle. Proteins involved in gene expression were enriched among rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated nuclear proteins, suggesting rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation may directly shape the daily rhythmicity of the hepatic transcriptome. Furthermore, we showed that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation can also indirectly modulate the hepatic transcriptome by interacting with phosphorylation. Specifically, several proteins harboring O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interplay motif exhibit rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. We propose that O-GlcNAcylation may occur at a phospho-degron of a key circadian transcriptional activator, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), thus regulating its stability and transcriptional output. Finally, we report that unnatural day time-restricted feeding (DRF) dampens O-GlcNAcylation rhythm, suggesting the disruption in liver transcriptomic rhythm previously observed in DRF condition could be mediated by dysregulation of daily protein O-GlcNAcylation rhythm. In summary, our results provide new mechanistic insights into metabolic regulation of daily hepatic transcriptomic rhythm via interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and shed light on the deleterious effects of improper mealtimes.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

A phylogenetically distinct Y. pseudotuberculosis cluster from lineages 1 and 8 is associated to a specific syndrome called the Far East scarlet-like fever (FESLF), characterized by skin rash, hyperemic tongue and desquamation. Genome sequencing of FESLF strains previously revealed the presence in the plasmid pVM82 of dot/icm genes, homologous to those known to encode a T4BSS in the intracellular pathogens Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii. In the present article, we characterized the genomic features and functionality of the Y. pseudotuberculosis T4BSS yT4BSS. We found higher dot/icm gene identity between Y. pseudotuberculosis and Pseudomonas putida genes than with those of L. pneumophila or C. burnetii. We validated the presence of all essential dot/icm genes required for the structure of a T4BSS. We then evaluated the conditions required for yT4BSS gene expression in vitro and identified an influence of temperature, with higher expression at 37 degrees C, which mimicks the mammalian host temperature. The yT4BSS is also expressed in cellulo during the Y. pseudotuberculosis intracellular life cycle and in vivo during mouse infection. Although T4BSS functions are well characterized in the intracellular life cycle of L. pneumophila and C. burnetii, the yT4BSS appears to not be required for the intracellular survival nor for the establishment of a replication niche within cells of Y. pseudotuberculosis. Interestingly, the yT4BSS is implicated in Y. pseudotuberculosis FESLF strain pathogenicity when orally inoculated to mice but not during intravenous inoculation. Despite a role in virulence during oral infection, the yT4BSS does not influence organ colonization. However, the yT4BSS appears to be implicated in induction of important necrosis lesions in mesenteric lymph nodes and caeca of mice. Cytokine profil analyses revealed an induction of production of innate immunity related cytokines and chemokines depending on the yT4BSS in cellulo using a mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infection model. Thus, the yT4BSS modulates cytokine responses of the host innate immune system during oral infection. In conclusion, the yT4BSS is a newly characterized virulence factor implicated in pathogenicity of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains from lineage 8 responsible for FESLF.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Similar to phiKZ-gp14, recently shown to form a complex with the P. aeruginosa ribosome, we predict experimentally that gp335 interacts with ribosomal proteins, suggesting its involvement in protein translation. GFP-tagged gp335 clusters around the phage nucleus as early as 15 minutes post-infection and remains associated with it throughout the infection, suggesting its role in protein expression in the cell cytoplasm.

First, our approach comparing mixed sensory and motor tibial and purely sensory sural nerves shows key pathway differences in affected nerves, with distinct immunological features observed in sural nerves. Second, spatial transcriptomics analysis of sural nerves reveals substantial shifts in endothelial and immune cell types associated with severe axonal loss. We also find clear evidence of neuronal gene transcript changes, like PRPH, in nerves with axonal loss suggesting perturbed RNA transport into distal sensory axons. This motivated further investigation into neuronal mRNA localization in peripheral nerve axons generating clear evidence of robust localization of mRNAs such as SCN9A and TRPV1 in human sensory axons. Our work gives new insight into the altered cellular and transcriptomic profiles in human nerves in DPN and highlights the importance of sensory axon mRNA transport as an unappreciated potential contributor to peripheral nerve degeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Using isoLASER, we identified 2,047 and 4,679 unique exonic regions exhibiting cis-directed splicing in human and mouse data respectively. Moreover, applied to a small number of samples jointly, isoLASER reveals splicing-associated variants that were only identifiable using large sample cohorts in previous association studies. Importantly, isoLASER enables HLA typing using long-read RNA-seq alone and uncovers allele-specific splicing of HLA genes.

To establish genotype-phenotype correlations, we investigate how sequence mutations govern the contour and persistence length of the RNA origami nanotubes with experiments and coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations, realizing a phenotypic transition to closed rings. Finally, we achieve RNA origami cortex formation and GUV deformation without chemical functionalization by introducing RNA aptamers into the tile design.Altogether, this work pioneers the expression of RNA origami-based hardware in vesicles as a new approach towards active, evolvable and RNA-based synthetic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

These gradients provide crucial insight into the relationship between the brain's topographic organization and the texture of human cognition. However, no studies to date have charted how intrinsic FC gradient architecture develops across the entire human lifespan. In this work, we model developmental trajectories of the three primary gradients of FC using a large, high-quality, and temporally-dense functional MRI dataset spanning from birth to 100 years of age. The gradient axes, denoted as sensorimotor-association (SA), visual-somatosensory (VS), and modulation-representation (MR), encode crucial hierarchical organizing principles of the brain in development and aging. By tracking their evolution throughout the human lifespan, we provide the first ever comprehensive low-dimensional normative reference of global FC hierarchical architecture. We observe significant age-related changes in global network features, with global markers of hierarchical organization increasing from birth to early adulthood and decreasing thereafter. During infancy and early childhood, FC organization is shaped by primary sensory processing, dense short-range connectivity, and immature association and control hierarchies. Functional differentiation of transmodal systems supported by long-range coupling drives a convergence toward adult-like FC organization during late childhood, while adolescence and early adulthood are marked by the expansion and refinement of SA and MR hierarchies. While gradient topographies remain stable during late adulthood and aging, we observe decreases in global gradient measures of FC differentiation and complexity from 30 to 100 years. Examining cortical microstructure gradients alongside our functional gradients, we observed that structure-function gradient coupling undergoes differential lifespan trajectories across multiple gradient axes.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

To circumvent the systemic adverse effects of T3/T4, we have asked in the current pilot study whether topically applied T3/T4 retains hair growth-promoting properties. To prove this, we have topically treated healthy full-thickness human scalp skin with T3 (1, 10nM) and T4 (1, 10M) for six days in serum-free organ culture, using an HF-targeting vehicle that contains only FDA-approved ingredients. This showed that, at distinct doses, topical T3 and T4 significantly increased the percentage of HFs in anagen, decreased the percentage of proliferative (Ki-67+) cells in the hair matrix, did not promote melanogenesis (as measured by quantitative Warthin-Starry histochemistry), and significantly increased keratin 15 expression in the bulge. Finally, T3 and T4, at low concentrations, increase the expression of the hair growth promoters IGF-1 and FGF-7. The lower concentration of T3 and both of T4 also significantly increases the number of CD31+ endothelial cells, suggesting a pro-angiogenic effect, which is also important for hair growth promotion. These preliminary results strongly suggest that topically applied thyroid hormones promote hair growth in intact human scalp on multiple levels ex vivo. This invites the intermittent pulse application of topical T3 and T4 as a novel therapeutic intervention for managing hair loss disorders associated with telogen effluvium, such as androgenetic alopecia.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Based on the prediction that the microRNA miRNA-132-3p is the miRNA that possibly lies upstream of the WT1 gene, we hypothesized that miRNA-132-3p may participate in the polarization process of macrophages through regulating expression of the WT1 gene. The focus of the present study was therefore to investigate the role of the miRNA-132-3p/WT1 signaling axis in the differentiation of THP-1 leukemia cells into macrophages induced by PMA. The results obtained indicated that, compared with the control group, the proliferation of THP-1 cells was clearly inhibited by PMA, and the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase, associated with an upregulation of CD11b and CD14 expression. Induced by PMA, the expression level of miRNA-132-3p was increased, WT1 expression was decreased, and the expression level of TGF-beta1 was increased. Following transfection with miRNA-132-3p mimics, however, the expression of WT1 in the THP-1 cells was downregulated, with upregulation of the CD11b and CD14 antigens, whereas this downregulation of WT1 mediated by miRNA-132-3p mimics could be reversed by co-transfection with WT1 vector, which was accompanied by downregulation of the CD11b and CD14 antigens. The luciferase activity of the co-transfected miRNA-132-3p mimic + WT1-wild-type (WT) group was found to be statistically significantly lower compared with that of the co-transfected miRNA-132-3p mimic + WT1-mutated (MUT) group. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that WT1 was able to directly target the promoter of the downstream target gene TGF-beta1, which led to the negative modulation of TGF-beta1 expression, whereas downregulation of WT1 led to an upregulation of the expression of TGF-beta1, which thereby promoted the differentiation of THP-1 cells into macrophages. Taken together, the present study has provided evidence, to the best of the authors' knowledge for the first time, that the miRNA-132-3p/WT1/TGF-beta1 axis is able to regulate the committed differentiation of leukemia cells into macrophages.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Body weight decreased (P < 0.01) in the TRE and CR groups, relative to controls, in males, premenopausal females, and postmenopausal females, by month 12. Total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) levels did not change over time, or between groups, in males, premenopausal females, and postmenopausal females. Estradiol, estrone, and progesterone were only measured in postmenopausal females, and remained unchanged. These findings suggest that TRE produces significant weight loss but does not impact circulating sex hormone levels in males and females with obesity over 12 months, relative to CR and controls.

In the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), fast oscillations (sharp-wave ripples) during non-REM sleep consolidate spatial memories through place cell reactivation. The hippocampal formation is heterogeneous; the dHPC processes mostly contextual information, while the ventral part (vHPC) encodes valence and anxiety. We propose that dorsal- ventral communication during sleep is involved in the consolidation of emotional memories, potentially integrating or segregating contextual and valence information. To test this, we recorded the electrophysiological activity in the dHPC and vHPC in rats during reward and aversion-motivated exploration of a linear track and subsequent sleep. We detected dorsal and ventral SWRs during NREM sleep as well as neuronal assemblies during each exploration type and identified dorsal, ventral, and joint (dorso-ventral) assemblies. We found that dorso-ventral hippocampal coordination involves coordinated ripples and bursts of ripples. Aversive joint assemblies exhibited higher reactivation during non-REM sleep than the joint assemblies from the reward condition. Interestingly, joint aversive assemblies reactivated selectively during dorso-ventral coordinated ripples. Furthermore, their reactivation strength positively correlated with their strength of activation during the task. These results suggest the existence of dorsal-ventral hippocampal functional communication capable of sustaining the selective reactivation of experiences based on their emotional valence.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

The most abundant viral factor in latently infected cells is not a protein but a noncoding RNA called EBV-encoded RNA 1 (EBER1). Even though EBER1 is highly abundant and was discovered over forty years ago, the function of EBER1 has remained elusive. EBER1 interacts with the ribosomal protein L22, which normally suppresses the expression of its paralog L22-like 1 (L22L1). Here we show that when L22 binds EBER1, it cannot suppress L22L1, resulting in L22L1 being expressed and incorporated into ribosomes. We further show that L22L1-containing ribosomes preferentially translate mRNAs involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Moreover, upregulation of L22L1 is indispensable for growth transformation and immortalization of resting B cells upon EBV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that the function of EBER1 is to modulate host gene expression at the translational level, thus bypassing the need for dysregulating host gene transcription.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

These interactions can be characterized as being either redundancy or synergy-dominated by the heuristic O-information [1]. Though the O-information can be decomposed into local values to measure the synergy-redundancy dominance at each point in a time series [2] no such analysis of fMRI dynamics has been carried out. Here we analyze the moment-to-moment synergy and redundancy dominance of the fMRI BOLD signal during rest for 95 unrelated subjects. We present results from several interaction sizes. The whole brain is rarely synergy-dominated, with some subjects never experiencing a whole-brain synergistic moment. Randomly sampled subsets of many sizes reveal that subsets that are the most redundancy dominated on average exhibit both the most synergistic and most redundant time points. Exhaustive calculation of the optimally synergistic and optimally redundant triads further emphasizes this finding, with recurrent nodes frequently belonging to a single coherent functional system. We find that when a triad is momentarily synergistic, it is often split between two instantaneously co-fluctuating communities, but is collectively co-fluctuating when it is momentarily redundant. After optimizing for synergy and redundancy in subsets of size five to seventy-five, we show that this effect is consistent across interaction sizes. Additionally, we find notable temporal structure in all optimized redundant and synergistic subsets: higher order redundant and synergistic interactions change smoothly in time and recur more than expected by chance.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Current recommendations for screening for tuberculosis specify community characteristics (e.g., areas with high local tuberculosis prevalence) that can be used to target screening within the general population. However, areas of higher tuberculosis burden are not necessarily areas with higher rates of transmission. We investigated the genomic diversity and transmission of Mtb using high-resolution surveillance data in Blantyre, Malawi.

Methods and FindingsWe extracted and performed whole genome sequencing on mycobacterial DNA from cultured M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from culture-positive tuberculosis cases at the time of tuberculosis (TB) notification in Blantyre, Malawi between 2015-2019. We constructed putative transmission networks identified using TransPhylo and investigated individual and pair-wise demographic, clinical, and spatial factors associated with person-to-person transmission. We found that 56% of individuals with sequenced isolates had a probable direct transmission link to at least one other individual in the study. We identified thirteen putative transmission networks that included five or more individuals. Five of these networks had a single spatial focus of transmission in the city, and each focus centered in a distinct neighborhood in the city. We also found that approximately two-thirds of inferred transmission links occurred between individuals residing in different geographic zones of the city.

ConclusionWhile the majority of detected tuberculosis transmission events in Blantyre occurred between people living in different zones, there was evidence of distinct geographical concentration for five transmission networks. These findings suggest that targeted interventions in areas with evidence of localized transmission may be an effective local tactic, but will likely need to be augmented by city-wide interventions to improve case finding and to address social determinants of tuberculosis to have sustained impact.

Author SummaryWhy was this study done? - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat and a leading cause of death due to infectious disease. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of individuals with TB is vital to reduce the spread of disease.
- If public health programs can identify areas with ongoing TB transmission, resources might be directed toward intervening in those areas to interrupt transmission chains. However, in settings where many people have TB, it is often difficult to differentiate areas with high rates of disease from areas with high rates of local transmission.


What did the researchers do and find? - We used whole genome sequencing data to infer networks of TB transmission in Blantyre, Malawi. We used individual residence data to identify whether transmission networks were concentrated in specific parts of the city and to describe the amount of transmission that occurred between vs. within distinct parts of the city.
- We found that most TB transmission in Blantyre occurred between individuals who did not live near each other. We also identified five transmission networks which had strong local foci of transmission.


What do these findings mean? - Because most TB transmission in Blantyre does not occur in concentrated areas, city-wide interventions, such as improving access to TB care services and addressing social determinants of TB, may be needed to improve TB control.
- For areas where there is evidence of local concentrated transmission, additional resources and strategies, such as targeted active case finding, may help to more rapidly reduce transmission and TB incidence.","NA","medrxiv",1718661929827

Conventional matrices used for hormone assessment include blood serum, saliva, urine and faeces, typically involving invasive human-animal interaction, which is known to initiate an acute stress response and thus confound studies assessing cortisol. As such, these matrices are most appropriate as short-term, point measures as they reflect circulating concentrations at the level of the minute and hour. Alternatively, non-invasive hair and wool assessment offer long-term, historic reflections of hormone concentration at the scale of weeks and months and are not limited by sampling stress thus making wool an appropriate tissue for hormone analysis. This pilot study quantified cortisol and testosterone concentrations of ram fleece and determine if there is a significant difference between segments of the sample staple, and whether there is a correlation between hormones. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid produced within the adrenal glands and secreted in anticipation of or in response to a stressor. Testosterone is an androgen mainly synthesised within the testes of males and responsible for several critical functions including regulation of muscle growth, libido and spermatogenesis. In our study, 70 topknot wool samples were collected from rams on a commercial stud property in Dirranbandi, Queensland, Australia. Of these animals, 12 samples were selected at random to undergo cortisol and testosterone quantification. In the laboratory, a single, intact staple was isolated from the total sample, divided into 10 mm segments and prepared for their respective (cortisol or testosterone) immunoassays. No significant difference (p>0.05) was found between wool segments for either cortisol or testosterone, however, statistical differences (p<0.05) were found between individuals for both hormones. A strong correlation (R2=0.9173) was found between wool cortisol and testosterone concentrations, which was a first-time discovery in rams. Furthermore, climate loggers (n=6) were installed in proximity to the rams to collect daily maximum temperature (oC) and relative humidity (RH%) data to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI) as an indicator of potential heat stress. Under this method, rams were deemed comfortable at a THI<72; under mild stress at a THI of between 72 and 78; moderate stress between 79 and 80 and severe stress at a THI of >81. Mean weekly THI peaked in late summer (February), remained high in early autumn (March), decreased throughout the remainder of autumn and the duration of winter before increasing slightly as temperatures rose in early spring (September). Over the trial, 90.36% or 4,706 h were marked by comfortable conditions, 8.95% or 466 h by mild stress, 0.60% or 31 h by moderate, and 0.10% or 5 h by severe stress. It was determined that THI is most valuable when combined with other methods of measuring heat stress, including non-invasive wool hormone assessment. Whilst most of the findings in this study were previously confirmed by other studies, the strong correlation between wool cortisol and testosterone concentrations appears to be a first. In summary, this study reveals the major future possibilities for non-invasive wool hormone assessment and the possible applications of combining this with temperature-humidity index scores to provide further insight into heat stress within the context of production animal agriculture.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

In this study, we employed proximity-based APEX2 proteomics to interrogate the interaction network of the GPCR for luteinizing hormone (LHR) on a sub-minute timescale. We developed an analytical approach integrating quantitative multiplexed proteomics and temporal reference profiles, providing a platform to identify the proteomic environment of APEX2-tagged LHR at the nanometer scale. LHR activity is exquisitely regulated at a spatial level, leading to identification of novel interactors including the Ras-related GTPase RAP2B that modulate both receptor signaling and post-endocytic trafficking, and providing a resource for spatiotemporal nanodomain mapping of LHR interactors across subcellular compartments.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

In particular, obtaining well-diffracting protein crystals suitable for characterizing ligands or drug candidates and understanding different protein conformations remains a bottleneck for structural studies.

Here we show that by exploring and testing the nanobody-nanobody interfaces predominant in >200 combinations of surface mutations in multiple iterations we can engineer robust crystallization behaviour into the nanobody scaffold. Strikingly, this survey yielded multiple polymorphs, all mediated by the same interface. The resulting  Gluebodies (Gbs) provide far superior resolution and reliability of diffraction and can be routinely generated for chaperone experiments. We furthermore show that Gbs cannot rescue intrinsically non-crystallizing proteins, but instead are a powerful approach to improve the packing and resolution limit of poorly diffracting crystals. The discovery of an engineered, preferred nanobody interface that arises under kinetic control - trapped here by irreversible crystallization - embodies a protein assembly strategy that could prove even more broadly useful for modular assembly trapped by other irreversible methods.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

The process of autophagy involves the engulfment of intracellular targets by autophagosomes and their delivery to the lysosome for digestion and recycling. We have previously reported recessive variants in EPG5, encoding for the ectopic P-granules 5 autophagy protein with a crucial role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, as the cause of Vici syndrome (VS), a severe multisystem neurodevelopmental disorder defined by a combination of distinct clinical features including callosal agenesis, cataracts, cardiomyopathy, immunodeficiency, and hypopigmentation. Here, we present extensive novel genetic, clinical, neuroradiological and pathological features from the largest cohort of EPG5-related disorders reported to date, complemented by experimental findings from patient cells and models of EPG5 defects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Mus musculus. We identified 200 patients with recessive EPG5 variants, 86 of them previously unpublished. The associated phenotypic spectrum ranged from antenatally lethal presentations and the classic VS phenotype (n=60) to much milder neurodevelopmental disorders with less specific manifestations (n=140). Myopathic features and epilepsy with variable progression were frequently observed. Novel manifestations included early-onset parkinsonism and dystonia with cognitive decline during adolescence, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSPP), and myoclonus. Radiological findings included previously recognized EPG5-related features with callosal abnormalities and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and a range of novel features suggesting an emerging continuum with disorders of brain iron accumulation or copper metabolism as well as HSPPs. Genotype-phenotype studies suggested a correlation between predicted residual EPG5 expression and clinical severity, especially regarding disease progression and survival. The Epg5 p.Gln331Arg knock-in mouse, a model of milder EPG5-related disorders, showed an age-related motor phenotype and impaired autophagic clearance in several brain regions mirroring those also affected in humans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, epg-5 knockdown gave rise to neurodevelopmental features and motor impairment comparable to defects in parkinsonism-related genes, abnormal mitochondrial respiration, and impaired mitophagic clearance early in life. Cellular assays revealed impaired PINK1-Parkin dependent mitophagic clearance in patient fibroblasts. Our findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of EPG5-related disorders and indicate a life time continuum of disease that overlaps with other disorders of defective autophagy and intracellular trafficking. Our observations also suggest close links between early-onset neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions of later onset due to EPG5 defects, in particular dystonia and parkinsonism, highlighting the fundamental importance of dysfunctional autophagy in the pathophysiology of common neurodegenerative disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1718661929827

Given the paucity of approved therapeutic strategies for this lifestyle disorder, dietary interventions may prove effective. We evaluated how green jackfruit flour (JF) prevents MASH and progression to HCC and its underlying mechanisms. The study utilized two murine models that mimicked human MASLD disease: (i) a diet-induced MASH model; (ii) a MASH-HCC model induced by diet and a very low dose of CCl4. C57Bl/6 mice were fed with chow (CD) or western diet (WD) with normal (NW) or sugar water (SW) for 12 weeks, then randomized to receive either 5 kcal% green jackfruit flour (JF) or an equal volume of placebo flour (PB). The biochemical, histological, and molecular analyses were assessed. JF significantly reduced body weight, liver injury, insulin resistance, and alleviated obesity, steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development in WDSW or WDSW/CCl4 mice compared to placebo groups. Furthermore, JF activated AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) and inhibited MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways in MASH and MASH-HCC experimental models, respectively. This was supported by sodium propionate treatment, the primary short-chain fatty acid entering the liver from JFs soluble fiber microbial fermentation, which also regulated AMPK and MAPK signaling in cellular models of MASH and HCC, respectively. Hence, our findings present strong evidence of JFs therapeutic potential in the prevention of MASH and MASH-HCC, warranting further investigation of JFs efficacy as a dietary intervention in clinical trials.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change with time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a unifying theoretical frame-work, a general interpretation, and a common set of measures to quantify the dFC matrices properties. Moreover, the dFC field has been lacking ad-hoc algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently. This has prevented the field to show its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real time applications.

With this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a unifying approach that allows the study brain signals at different spatio-temporal scales, down to voxel level, that is computationally ultrafast. DySCo unifies in a single theoretical framework the most employed dFC matrices, which share a common mathematical structure. Doing so it allows:

O_LIA new interpretation of dFC that further justifies its use to capture the spatiotemporal patterns of data interactions in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities.
C_LIO_LIThe introduction of the the Recurrence Matrix EVD to compute and store the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of all types of dFC matrices in an efficent manner that is orders of magnitude faster than naive algorithms, and without loss of information.
C_LIO_LITo simply define quantities of interest for the dynamic analyses such as: the amount of connectivity (norm of a matrix) the similarity between matrices, their informational complexity.
C_LI

The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm - the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We demonstrate that all the measures proposed are highly sensitive to changes in brain configurations. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we perform the analysis at the voxel-level, a computationally very demanding task which is easily afforded by the RMEVD algorithm.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Furthermore, the HD system developed a unique mapping between its internal organization and spatial orientation in each environment. This was not affected by visits to other environments and was stabilized with experience.

Descendants of local Khoe-San and Bantu-speaking populations, European settlers, and enslaved individuals from Africa and Asia, SAC individuals embody diverse ancestries. This study investigates the genetic makeup of SAC individuals, utilizing autosomal genotypes, mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome data. We analyze new genotype data for 125 SAC individuals from seven locations. Our analysis, based on a dataset comprising 356 SAC individuals from 22 geographic locations, revealed significant regional variations in ancestry. Khoe-San ancestry predominates in 14 locations, highlighting its lasting influence. Inland regions exhibit higher proportions of Khoe-San ancestry, eastern regions show more Bantu-speaker/West African ancestry, and western/coastal areas, particularly around Cape Town, display increased Asian ancestry. These patterns reflect historical migrations and settlement patterns. Additionally, sex-biased admixture ratios show male-biased admixture from East Africans and Europeans, and female-biased admixture from Khoe-San populations, which is supported by mitochondrial and Y-chromosome data. This research underscores the importance of studying the SAC population to understand South Africa's historical migrations, providing insights into the complex genetic heritage of South Africans.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

The rapid structural changes seen in plasmid genomes present considerable challenges to evolutionary and epidemiological analysis. Typical approaches are either low resolution (replicon typing) or use shared k-mer content to define a genetic distance. However this distance can both overestimate plasmid relatedness by ignoring rearrangements, and underestimate by over-penalising gene gain/loss. Therefore a model is needed which captures the key components of how plasmid genomes evolve structurally - through gene/block gain or loss, and rearrangement. A secondary requirement is to prevent promiscuous transposable elements (TEs) leading to over-clustering of unrelated plasmids. We choose the ""Double Cut and Join Indel"" model, in which plasmids are studied at a coarse level, as a sequence of signed integers (representing genes or aligned blocks), and the distance between two plasmids is the minimum number of rearrangement events or indels needed to transform one into the other. We show how this gives much more meaningful distances between plasmids. We introduce a software workflow pling (https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/pling), which uses the DCJ-Indel model, to calculate distances between plasmids and then cluster them. In our approach, we combine containment distances and DCJ-Indel distances to build a TE-aware plasmid network. We demonstrate superior performance and interpretability to other plasmid clustering tools on the ""Russian Doll"" dataset and a hospital transmission dataset.

Impact statementStudying plasmid transmission is a necessary component of understanding antibiotic resistance spread, but identifying recently related plasmids is difficult and often requires manual curation. Pling simplifies this by leveraging a combination of containment distances and rearrangement distances to cluster plasmids. The outcome are clusters of recently related plasmids with a clear backbone and relatively large core genomes, in contrast to other tools which sometimes overcluster. Additionally the network constructed by pling provides a framework with which to spot evolutionary events, such as potential fusions of plasmids and spread of transposable elements.

Here, we identify a novel stress response pathway activated by mitochondrial damage that regulates mitophagy in neurons. We find that increasing levels of mitochondrial stress triggers a graded, concerted response that induces proteasomal degradation of negative regulators of autophagy. These include Myotubularin-related phosphatase 5 (MTMR5), MTMR2 and Rubicon. This  Mitophagic Stress Response (MitoSR) pathway is neuron-specific and acts in parallel to the classical Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. While MTMR5/MTMR2 inhibits autophagosome biogenesis, we find that Rubicon inhibits lysosomal function and thus blocks autophagosome maturation. Targeted depletion of these negative regulators is sufficient to enhance mitophagy, promoting autophagosome biogenesis and facilitating the fusion of mitophagosomes with lysosomes. Our work suggests that therapeutic activation of the MitoSR pathway to induce degradation of negative regulators of autophagy may enhance mitochondrial quality control in stressed neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Wolbachia strains transferred from other insects to mosquitoes can be released to combat dengue transmission by blocking virus replication and spreading through populations, but host fitness costs imposed by Wolbachia, particularly under some environments, can impede spread. We therefore assessed the impact of two Wolbachia strains being released for dengue control (wAlbB and wMelM) on fecundity and egg viability following extended egg retention (12 or 18 d) under laboratory conditions. Egg viability decreased to a greater extent in females carrying wMelM compared to uninfected or wAlbB females. Fertility fully recovered in uninfected females following a second blood meal after laying retained eggs, while wMelM females experienced only partial recovery. Effects of wMelM on egg retention were similar regardless of whether females were crossed to uninfected or wMelM males, suggesting that fitness costs were triggered by Wolbachia presence in females. The fecundity and hatch proportions of eggs of wMelM females declined with age, regardless of whether females used stored sperm or were recently inseminated. Costs of some Wolbachia strains during egg retention may affect the invasion and persistence of Wolbachia in release sites where larval habitats are scarce and/or intermittent.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

The significance of these interactions remains elusive. Here, we show that FACT has multiple additional binding sites on CCAN. The interaction with CCAN is strongly stimulated by casein kinase II (CK2) phosphorylation of FACT. Mitotic localization of FACT to kinetochores is strictly dependent on specific CCAN subcomplexes. Unexpectedly, we also find that DNA readily displaces FACT from CCAN, suggesting that FACT becomes recruited through a pool of CCAN that is not stably integrated into chromatin. Collectively, our results point to a potential role of FACT in chaperoning CCAN during transcription or in the stabilization of CCAN at the centromere during the cell cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929827

Erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments often form during early mitosis, but are destabilized through the phosphorylation of outer kinetochore proteins by centromeric AURORA B kinase (ABK) and centrosomal AURORA A kinase (AAK), thus allowing for re-establishment of attachments until biorientation is achieved. MPS1-mediated phosphorylation of NDC80 has also been shown to directly weaken the kinetochore-microtubule interface in yeast. In human cells, MPS1 has been proposed to transiently accumulate at end-on attached kinetochores and phosphorylate SKA3 to promote microtubule release. Whether MPS1 directly targets NDC80 and/or promotes the activity of AURORA kinases in metazoans remains unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism involving communication between kinetochores and centrosomes, wherein MPS1 acts upstream of AAK to promote error correction. MPS1 on pole-proximal kinetochores phosphorylates the C-lobe of AAK thereby increasing its activation at centrosomes. This proximity-based activation ensures the establishment of a robust AAK activity gradient that locally destabilizes mal-oriented kinetochores near spindle poles. Accordingly, MPS1 depletion from Drosophila cells causes severe chromosome misalignment and erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which can be rescued by tethering either MPS1 or constitutively active AAK mutants to centrosomes. Proximity-based activation of AAK by MPS1 also occurs in human cells to promote AAK-mediated phosphorylation of the NDC80 N-terminal tail. These findings uncover an MPS1-AAK cross-talk that is required for efficient error correction, showcasing the ability of kinetochores to modulate centrosome outputs to ensure proper chromosome segregation.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

A comparison with the brain of Caenorhabditis elegans, which diverged at least 100 million years ago, reveals a conserved nematode core connectome and a wide range of specific substrates of evolutionary change. These changes include differences in neuronal cell death, neuronal cell position, axo-dendritic projection patterns and many changes in synaptic connectivity of homologous neurons that display no obvious changes in overall neurite morphology and projection patterns. Differences in connectivity are distributed throughout the nervous system arguing against specific hot spots of evolutionary change and extend to differences in neuro/glia connectivity. We observed examples of apparent circuit drift, where changes in morphology and connectivity of a neuron do not appear to alter its behavioral output. In conclusion, our comprehensive comparison of distantly related nematode species provides novel vistas on patterns of conservation as well as the substrates of evolutionary change in the brain that span multiple organizational levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

However, in assessing the similarity between two stimuli differing in multiple dimensions, it is not well-defined which feature(s) one should focus on. The problem has accordingly been considered ill-posed. We hypothesize that similarity judgments may be, in a sense, metacognitive: The stimuli rated as subjectively similar are those that are in fact more challenging for oneself to discern in practice, in near-threshold settings (e.g., psychophysics experiments). This self-knowledge about one's own perceptual capacities provides a quasi-objective ground truth as to whether two stimuli should be judged as similar. To test this idea, we measure perceptual discrimination capacity between face pairs, and ask subjects to rank the similarity between them. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize a positive association between perceptual discrimination capacity and subjective dissimilarity, with this association being importantly specific to each individual.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

Despite its importance, both the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins of this variability remain largely unknown due to the mixed contributions of cis- and trans-acting elements. To address this issue, we focused on the mutational variability of cis-acting elements, that is, promoter regions, in Escherichia coli. Random mutations were introduced into the natural and synthetic promoters to generate mutant promoter libraries. By comparing the variance in promoter activity of these mutant libraries, we found no significant difference in mutational variability in promoter activity between promoter groups, suggesting the absence of a signature of natural selection for mutational robustness. In contrast, the promoters controlling essential genes exhibited a remarkable bias in mutational variability, with mutants displaying higher activities than the wild types being relatively rare compared to those with lower activities. Our evolutionary simulation on a rugged fitness landscape provided a rationale for this vulnerability. These findings suggest that bias in mutational variability in promoters may constrain the evolution of downstream essential genes toward higher expression levels.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

Here, we generated an ancient DNA time transect consisting of 219 individuals with genome-wide data from 47 sites in this region, supplemented by 97 new radiocarbon dates. Spanning from the Early Bronze Age 5000 years ago to the so-called  Migration Period that followed the fall of the Western Roman Empire, we document a largely persisting local gene pool that continuously assimilated migrants from Anatolia/Levant and the populations of the adjacent Eurasian steppe. More specifically, we observe these admixture events as early as the Middle Bronze Age. Starting with Late Antiquity (late first century AD), we also detect an increasing number of individuals with more southern ancestry, more frequently associated with urban centers - landmarks of the early Christianization in eastern Georgia. Finally, in the Early Medieval Period starting 400 AD, we observe genetic outlier individuals with ancestry from the Central Eurasian steppe, with artificial cranial deformations (ACD) in several cases.

To address this, we evaluated the fitness and pathogenesis of contemporary Omicron variants XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5.1, and JN.1 in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT). We compared in vivo infection in Syrian hamsters with infection in primary human nasal and lung epithelium cells and assessed differences in transmissibility, antigenicity, and innate immune activation. Omicron variants replicated efficiently in the URT but displayed limited pathology in the lungs compared to previous variants and failed to replicate in human lung organoids. JN.1 was attenuated in both URT and LRT compared to other Omicron variants and failed to transmit in the hamster model.

Hebbian plasticity depends on temporally coinciding pre- and post-synaptic activity. A tight temporal relationship between motor cortical (MC) activity associated with attempted movement and FES-generated visuo-proprioceptive feedback is hypothesized to enhance motor recovery. Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to classify MC spectral power in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to trigger FES-delivery with detection of movement attempts improved motor outcomes in chronic stroke patients. We hypothesized that heightened neural plasticity earlier post-stroke would further enhance corticomuscular functional connectivity and motor recovery. We compared subcortical non-dominant hemisphere stroke patients in BCI-FES and Random-FES (FES temporally independent of MC movement attempt detection) groups. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). We recorded high-density EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials before and after treatment. The BCI group showed greater: FMA-UE improvement; motor evoked potential amplitude; beta oscillatory power and long-range temporal correlation reduction over contralateral MC; and corticomuscular coherence with contralateral MC.

The recurrent evolution of this adaptation is achieved through changes in the expression and localisation of several enzymes and transporters that are conventionally used in non-photosynthetic metabolism. These alterations result in the establishment of a biochemical CO2 pump that increases the concentration of CO2 around rubisco in a cellular environment where rubisco is protected from oxygen thus preventing the occurrence of photorespiration. A key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis is the change in subcellular localisation of carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity from the mesophyll cell chloroplast to the cytosol, where it catalyzes the first biochemical step of the C4 pathway. Here, we achieve this key step in C4 evolution in the C3 plant Oryza sativa (rice) using genome editing. We show that editing the chloroplast transit peptide of the primary CA isoform in the leaf results in relocalisation of leaf CA activity from the chloroplast to the cytosol. Through analysis of fluorescence induction kinetics in these CA relocalisation lines we uncover a role a new role for chloroplast CA in photosynthetic induction. We also reveal that relocalisation of CA activity to the cytosol causes no detectable perturbation to plant growth or leaf-level CO2 assimilation. Collectively, this work uncovers a novel role for chloroplast CA in C3 plants, and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a key step in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis by genome editing.

Significance statementC4 photosynthesis is a highly efficient adaptation to photosynthesis that fuels the worlds most productive crop plants. It evolved from conventional C3 photosynthesis through a series of changes in leaf biochemistry and anatomy. Here we achieve a key evolutionary step on the path to C4 photosynthesis in rice using genome editing. Specifically, we alter the primary location of carbonic anhydrase activity in the rice leaf from the chloroplast to the cytosol. In doing so, we uncover a novel role for carbonic anhydrase in facilitating the rapid induction kinetics of photosystem II, and initiate a new era of C4 engineering using precision breeding techniques.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

The ACC may achieve this by integrating reward information over time to estimate which objects are worth to explore and which objects should be avoided. Such a higher-order meta-awareness about which objects should be explored predicts that the ACC causally contributes to choices when the reward values of objects are unknown and must be inferred from ongoing exploration. We tested this suggestion in nonhuman primates using a learning task that varied the number of object features that could be relevant, and by controlling the motivational value of choosing objects. During learning the ACC was transiently micro-stimulated when subjects foveated the to-be-chosen stimulus. We found that stimulation selectively impaired learning when feature uncertainty and motivational value of choices were high, which was linked to a deficit in using reward outcomes for feature-specific credit assignment. Application of an adaptive reinforcement learning model confirmed a primary deficit in weighting prediction errors that led to a meta-learning impairment to adaptively increase exploration during learning and to an impaired use of working memory to support learning. These findings provide causal evidence that the reward history traces in ACC are essential for meta-adjusting the exploration-exploitation balance and the strength of working memory of object values during adaptive behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

Although post-transcriptional modifications of these non-coding RNAs are common in many systems, chloroplast tRNA and rRNA modifications are not well characterised. In this study, we investigated the post-transcriptional modifications in chloroplast tRNAs and rRNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana using tRNA sequencing, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, targeted rRNA sequencing, and analysis of public data. Our results revealed similarities between chloroplast non-coding RNAs and bacterial systems (e.g., Escherichia coli), such as modification patterns at the anticodon-adjacent position and the variable loop of tRNAs, along with conserved modifications in the small subunit rRNA. Additionally, we identified features shared with eukaryotic systems that likely contribute to the correct three-dimensional structure of chloroplast tRNAs. Unique modifications were also discovered, including a potential novel modification at wobble position in tRNA-IleCAU, which may be crucial for distinguishing isoleucine codons from methionine codons, and chloroplast-specific rRNA modifications that likely compensate for altered ribosome structure. These findings suggest that the chloroplast translation machinery, through co-evolution with its eukaryotic host, has adopted features beyond those typically found in bacteria, reflecting a blend of ancestral and acquired characteristics.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

Consequently, mutant plants lacking SBT5.2a activity retain higher levels of csp22, leading to enhanced immune responses and reduced pathogen growth. SBT5.2 sensitivity is influenced by sequence variation surrounding the cleavage site and likely extends to CSPs from other bacterial species.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway.

JN.1 subsequently diversified, leading to the emergence of descendants with spike (S) protein substitutions such as S:R346T and S:F456L. Particularly, the KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) variant, a descendant of JN.1 bearing both S:R346T and S:F456L, is rapidly spreading in multiple regions as of April 2024. Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.2. KP.2 has three substitutions in the S protein including the two above and additional one substitution in non-S protein compared with JN.1. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.2 based on the genome surveillance data from the USA, United Kingdom, and Canada where >30 sequences of KP.2 has been reported, using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model. The Re of KP.2 is 1.22-, 1.32-, and 1.26-times higher than that of JN.1 in USA, United Kingdom, and Canada, respectively. These results suggest that KP.2 has higher viral fitness and potentially becomes the predominant lineage worldwide. Indeed, as of the beginning of April 2024, the estimated variant frequency of KP.2 has already reached 20% in United Kingdom.

The pseudovirus assay showed that the infectivity of KP.2 is significantly (10.5-fold) lower than that of JN.1.

Altogether, these results suggest that the increased immune resistance ability of KP.2 partially contributes to the higher Re more than previous variants including JN.1.","10.1016/S1473-3099(24)00298-6","biorxiv",1718661929828

We sought to determine the immunologic abnormalities in these patients and to investigate whether the potential etiology was similar to Post-Acute Sequalae of COVID (PASC), or long COVID.

We studied 50 individuals who received one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and who experienced new onset PASC-like symptoms along with 45 individuals post-vaccination without symptoms as controls. We performed multiplex cytokine/chemokine profiling with machine learning as well as SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein detection on CD16+ monocyte subsets using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry. We determined that post-vaccination individuals with PASC- like symptoms had similar symptoms to PASC patients. When analyzing their immune profile, Post-vaccination individuals had statistically significant elevations of sCD40L (p<0.001), CCL5 (p=0.017), IL-6 (p=0.043), and IL-8 (p=0.022). Machine learning characterized these individuals as PASC using previously developed algorithms. Of the S1 positive post-vaccination patients, we demonstrated by liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry that these CD16+ cells from post-vaccination patients from all 4 vaccine manufacturers contained S1, S1 mutant and S2 peptide sequences. Post-COVID vaccination individuals with PASC-like symptoms exhibit markers of platelet activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may be driven by the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 proteins in intermediate and non-classical monocytes. The data from this study also cannot make any inferences on epidemiology and prevalence for persistent post-COVID vaccine symptoms. Thus, further studies and research need to be done to understand the risk factors, likelihood and prevalence of these symptoms.

While the sea urchin is one of the oldest animal models in cell and developmental biology, it has relied on transient manipulations of wild animals, and has lacked a strategy for stable transgenesis. Here we build on recent progress to develop a more genetically tractable sea urchin species, Lytechinus pictus, to establish a robust transgene integration method. Three commonly used transposons (Minos, Tol2, piggyBac) were tested for non-autonomous transposition, using plasmids containing a polyubiquitin promoter upstream of a H2B-mCerulean nuclear marker. Minos was the only transposable element that resulted in significant expression past metamorphosis. F0 animals were raised to sexual maturity and spawned to determine germline integration, transgene inheritance frequency, and to characterize expression patterns of the transgene in F1 progeny. The results demonstrated transgene transmission through the germline, the first example of a germline transgenic sea urchin, and indeed of any echinoderm. This milestone paves the way for the generation of diverse transgenic resources that will dramatically enhance the utility, reproducibility, and efficiency of sea urchin research.

Significance StatementTransgenic tools are essential for effective utilization of animal models. Despite being an established model for cell and developmental biology, the sea urchin has not previously benefited from transgenic technology. This study reports the generation of the first germline transgenic sea urchin and opens new avenues for this organism.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (3 June 2024), we have tested 34 retail milk samples from five Canadian provinces (NL, NS, PEI, NB, QC, MB, and AB) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner.

While increasing herd immunity, current vaccines, and therapeutics have improved outcomes for some; prophylactic and treatment interventions that are not compromised by viral evolution of the Spike protein are still needed. Using a rationally designed SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) - ACE2 fusion protein and differential selection process with native Omicron RBD protein, we developed a recombinant human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) from a convalescent individual following SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infection. The resulting hmAb, 1301B7 potently neutralized a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the original Wuhan and more recent Omicron JN.1 strain, as well as SARS-CoV. Structure determination of the SARS-CoV-2 EG5.1 Spike/1301B7 Fab complex by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.1[A] resolution demonstrates 1301B7 contacts the ACE2 binding site of RBD exclusively through its VH1-69 heavy chain, making contacts using CDRs1-3, as well as framework region 3 (FR3). Broad specificity is achieved through 1301B7 binding to many conserved residues of Omicron variants including Y501 and H505. Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses.

The central biological question about HD pathogenesis has been how the disease-causing DNA repeat expansion (CAGn) in the huntingtin (HTT) gene leads to neurodegeneration after decades of apparent latency. Inherited HTT alleles with a longer CAG repeat hasten disease onset; the length of this repeat also changes over time, generating somatic mosaicism, and genes that regulate DNA-repeat stability can influence HD age-at-onset. To understand the relationship between a cells CAG-repeat length and its biological state, we developed a single-cell method for measuring CAG-repeat length together with genome-wide RNA expression. We found that the HTT CAG repeat expands from 40-45 CAGs to 100-500+ CAGs in HD-vulnerable SPNs but not in other striatal cell types, with these long DNA-repeat expansions acquired at different times by individual SPNs. Surprisingly, somatic expansion from 40 to 150 CAGs had no apparent effect upon gene expression - but neurons with 150-500+ CAGs shared profound gene-expression changes. These expression changes involved hundreds of genes, escalated alongside further CAG-repeat expansion, eroded positive and then negative features of neuronal identity, and culminated in expression of senescence/apoptosis genes. Rates of striatal neuron loss across HD stages reflected the rates at which neurons entered this biologically distorted state. Our results suggest that HTT CAG repeats in striatal neurons undergo decades of biologically quiet expansion, then, as they asynchronously cross a high threshold, cause SPNs to degenerate quickly and asynchronously. We conclude that, at any moment in the course of HD, most neurons have an innocuous (but unstable) huntingtin gene, and that HD pathogenesis is a DNA process for almost all of a neurons life.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national and sub-national discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance.

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1718661929828

These ruminants were presumed not to be hosts for IAVs. Previously, IAV-positive mammalian species were hunters and scavengers, possibly getting infected while feeding on infected birds. It is now presumed that H5N1 viruses that circulate in US dairy cattle transmit through a mammary gland route, in contrast to transmission by aerosols via the respiratory tract, although the latter cannot be excluded. The receptor display in the mammary and respiratory tract in cows for IAVs is unknown. Here, we used recombinant HA proteins representing current circulating and classical H5 viruses to determine the distribution of IAV receptors in the respiratory and mammary tract tissues of cows and goats. Most of the sialome of the cow and goat respiratory tract is lined with sialic acid modifications such as N-glycolyl and O-acetyl, which are not bound by IAV. Interestingly, the H5 protein representing the cow isolates bound significantly in the mammary gland, whereas classical H5 proteins failed to do so. Furthermore, whereas the 9-O-acetyl modification is prominent in all tissues tested, the 5-N-glycolyl modification is not, resulting in the display of receptors for avian IAV hemagglutinins. This could explain the high levels of virus found in these tissues and milk, adding supporting data to this possible virus transmission route.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

This is a case of sound-symbolism, known as the Bouba-Kiki effect. Studies on four-months infants suggest that this effect might constitute a predisposed perceptual mechanism. However, these studies suffered from the impossibility of ruling out a fast experience-driven origin of the effect resulting from infants speed of learning, their sensitivity to environmental regularities, and the large number of sound-symbolic associations to which they are precociously exposed when interacting with adults. To better describe its ontogeny and fill in this gap, we tested the Bouba-Kiki effect in domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). Being a precocial species, chicks can be tested on the very early days of life, allowing for a virtually total control of their experience before test. Three-day-old chicks (n=42) first learned to circumnavigate a panel to obtain a food reward. Then, they were presented with two identical panels, one depicting a spiky shape, and one depicting a round shape, while hearing either the sound  Bouba or  Kiki. We recorded which panel chicks chose with either sound, in a total of 24 trials. Chicks preferred the panel with the spiky shape when hearing the  Kiki sound, and that with the round shape when hearing the  Bouba sound. Results from naive baby chicks hint at a predisposed mechanism for matching the two dimensions of shape and sound that may be widespread across species.","NA","biorxiv",1718661929828

ResultsWe included 34549575 individuals of whom 2521812 had COVID-19, and 4233145 a first negative test. After COVID-19 compared to test negative patients, we observed IRRs of 1.24 (1.23-1.25), 1.22 (1.21-1.23), and 1.12 (1.04-1.21) for POTS symptoms, ME/CFS symptoms and diagnoses, respectively. In contrast, autoimmune diseases and DM did not yield higher rates after COVID-19. In individual general database populations, IRs of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses were 17-1477/100000 person-years (pys) and 2-473/100000 pys, respectively. IRs of MIS were lowest with IRs 0.4-16/100000 pys, those of DM as a benchmark 8-86/100000 pys. IRs largely depended on the care setting.

ConclusionIn our unmatched comparison, we observed that, following COVID-19, POTS and ME/CFS yielded higher rates than after negative testing. In absolute terms, we observed POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses to have a similar disease burden as DM.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIObservational research suggested positive associations between COVID-19 and so called post-acute COVID-19 conditions, whose spectrum is yet to be established
C_LIO_LIBasic research suggested pathways that link COVID-19 with autoimmune- and inflammatory diseases such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigues syndrome (ME/CFS), multiple inflammatory syndrome (MIS), and autoimmune diseases

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSO_LIAfter COVID-19, the rates of POTS symptoms and ME/CFS symptoms/diagnoses was higher than those after negative testing
C_LIO_LIAfter COVID-19 versus negative testing, rates of ME/CFS diagnoses were increased in the working age group and rates of symptoms of POTS and ME/CFS were increased in children and elderly
C_LIO_LIDisease burdens of POTS and ME/CFS diagnoses in the general population were higher among women than among men and overall similar to that of diabetes mellitus
