In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., [~]0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Here, we establish a phylogeny-in-a-dish approach to examine gene regulatory evolution by differentiating pools of human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque pluripotent stem cells into ventral midbrain organoids capable of forming long-range projections, spontaneous activity, and dopamine release. We identify human-specific gene expression changes related to axonal transport of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species buffering and candidate cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression divergence. Our findings are consistent with a model of evolved neuroprotection in response to tradeoffs related to brain expansion and could contribute to the discovery of therapeutic targets and strategies for treating disorders involving the dopaminergic system.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, most scientists dont have access to experts from multiple fields. Fortunately, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown an impressive ability to aid researchers across diverse domains by answering scientific questions. Here, we expand the capabilities of LLMs for science by introducing the Virtual Lab, an AI-human research collaboration to perform sophisticated, interdisciplinary science research. The Virtual Lab consists of an LLM principal investigator agent guiding a team of LLM agents with different scientific backgrounds (e.g., a chemist agent, a computer scientist agent, a critic agent), with a human researcher providing high-level feedback. We design the Virtual Lab to conduct scientific research through a series of team meetings, where all the agents discuss a scientific agenda, and individual meetings, where an agent accomplishes a specific task. We demonstrate the power of the Virtual Lab by applying it to design nanobody binders to recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, which is a challenging, open-ended research problem that requires reasoning across diverse fields from biology to computer science. The Virtual Lab creates a novel computational nanobody design pipeline that incorporates ESM, AlphaFold-Multimer, and Rosetta and designs 92 new nanobodies. Experimental validation of those designs reveals a range of functional nanobodies with promising binding profiles across SARS-CoV-2 variants. In particular, two new nanobodies exhibit improved binding to the recent JN.1 or KP.3 variants of SARS-CoV-2 while maintaining strong binding to the ancestral viral spike protein, suggesting exciting candidates for further investigation. This demonstrates the ability of the Virtual Lab to rapidly make impactful, real-world scientific discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

While intracellular Ca2+ signalling has been shown to control cell migration in multiple cell contexts, it is unknown whether it is required for DVE migration. The pattern of Ca2+ activity in the mouse embryo at early peri-implantation stages is also unknown. Using the GCaMP6f Ca2+ reporter line we performed a detailed assessment of Ca2+ dynamics between E0.5 - E5.5 using live imaging. We find that prior to implantation, Ca2+ transients are rare, but at E5.5 widespread, periodic, Ca2+ transients in extra-embryonic tissues can be observed, including in the VE and ExE. In contrast, cells of the E5.5 epiblast remain relatively quiescent but show sporadic large-scale multi-cellular waves. Inhibition of SERCA at E5.5 abolishes Ca2+ transients and leads to DVE arrest, indicative that these transients are required for axial patterning. Together these results reveal the pattern of Ca2+ handling in the early mouse embryo and a novel requirement in anterior-posterior axis formation.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, long-term data on CMD following severe COVID-19 are lacking.

ObjectiveTo determine long-term left ventricular (LV) function and presence of CMD after severe COVID-19, utilizing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and stress perfusion mapping.

MethodsHospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent CMR at 10 months follow-up (1.5T Aera, Siemens Healthineers) including cine imaging, native T1 and T2, extracellular volume, and adenosine stress perfusion mapping. Clinical data were obtained from patient records. Patients were compared to volunteers without symptomatic ischemic heart disease (IHD).

ResultsCOVID-19 patients (n=37, age 56{+/-}12 years, 76% male) and volunteers (n=22, age 51{+/-}13 years, 55% male, p=ns for both) were included. COVID-19 patients demonstrated reduced stress perfusion (2.8{+/-}0.81 vs 3.4{+/-}0.69 ml/min/g, p=0.003), impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS, -17{+/-}2 vs -19{+/-}2 %, p=0.003) and global circumferential strain (GCS, -16{+/-}3 vs -19{+/-}3 %, p=0.001). There were no differences in stress perfusion or myocardial perfusion reserve between COVID-19 patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors or cardiac symptoms.

ConclusionCOVID-19 patients exhibit long-term reduced stress perfusion indicating CMD, and impaired LV function by GLS and GCS. Lack of variation in stress perfusion between patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors suggests that CMD may be a consequence of severe COVID-19, warranting further investigation to elucidate mechanisms, and guide potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1732054175324

Despite ongoing surveillance and control measures recommended by animal and public health authorities to limit viral spread, new herds continue to report infections. We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred. For current interventions to be valuable, more sensitive and extensive surveillance is needed and an emphasis should be placed on biosecurity practices rather than reactive practices.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Yet, the role of the nervous system in disease pathogenesis has not received much attention. Herein, we demonstrate that allergen exposure evokes pain-like behavior in association with increased nociceptor signaling and transcriptional responses in dorsal root ganglia. NaV1.8+ sensory nerves were found traveling along the length of the esophagus, organized in distinct bundles adjacent to the basal epithelium, with beta III-tubulin+ sensory nerves distributed more distal to the lumen. Targeted deletion of Il4ra in NaV1.8+ neurons impeded allergen-induced increases in nerve innervation density. Furthermore, Il4ra-/-NaV1.8 mice had diminished allergen-induced allergic inflammation in the esophagus including eosinophilia and transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Translational studies revealed extensive myelinated nerve innervation in the human esophagus, which was increased in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis. Taken together, these data indicate that allergic inflammation is associated with an increase in non-evoked pain, esophageal nerve density, altered sensitivity of sensory neurons, and transcriptional changes in dorsal root ganglia. These finding identify a type 2 neuroimmune circuit that involves the interplay of allergen-induced IL-4 receptor-dependent DRG responses that modify esophageal end-organ inflammatory responses.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Here, we used isogenic trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) derived from both naive and primed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to reveal the spontaneous occurrence of aneuploidy, suggesting chromosomal instability (CIN) as an inherent feature of the trophoblast lineage. We identified potential pathways contributing to the occurrence and tolerance of CIN. These findings were further validated using single cell multiome data from human placentas, where we observed a high prevalence of heterogeneous aneuploidy across trophoblast cells. Despite extensive chromosomal abnormalities, TSCs maintained their proliferative and differentiation capacities, suggesting that CIN is a typical aspect of placental development. Our study challenges the traditional view of aneuploidy in the placenta and provides new insights into the role of CIN in normal placental function.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Therefore, investigating the real-time kinetics of Twinkles activities and their regulation is crucial for understanding mtDNA maintenance. Here, we combine biochemical and single-molecule manipulation and visualization techniques to investigate the loading of Twinkle onto the DNA fork, its real-time DNA unwinding and rewinding kinetics, and the regulation of these processes by the amino- (N) and carboxyl- (C) terminal ends of the helicase and the mitochondrial SSB protein (mtSSB). We observed that Twinkle rapidly diffuses along dsDNA scanning for the DNA fork, where it establishes specific interactions that halt further diffusion. Our results show that during DNA unwinding, the real-time kinetics of the helicase are downregulated by interactions of its N-terminal Zinc-binding domain (ZBD) with DNA and the control of the ATPase activity by the C-terminal tail. We found that binding of mtSSB to DNA likely outcompetes the ZBD-DNA interactions, alleviating the down regulatory effects of this domain. Furthermore, we show that ZBD-DNA interactions, together with the ATP binding, also control the real-time kinetics of the DNA rewinding events that follow helicase stalling. Our findings reveal that ZBD and C-terminal tail play a major role in regulation of Twinkles real-time kinetics. Their interplay constitutes an auto-regulatory mechanism that may be crucial for coordination of the mtDNA maintenance activities of the helicase.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Here, we sought to define a comprehensive repertoire of cell surface antigens that can be targeted to stimulate macrophage-mediated destruction of B-cell lymphoma. We developed a high-throughput assay to screen hundreds of antibodies for their ability to provoke macrophages to attack B-cell lymphoma cells. Across both mouse and human systems, we identified multiple unappreciated targets of opsonization as well as putative immune checkpoints. We used this information to engineer a compendium of 156 bispecific antibodies, and we identified dozens of bispecifics that dramatically stimulate macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity of lymphoma cells. Among these, a bispecific comprising a SIRP decoy domain and a CD38-targeting arm (WTa2d1xCD38) exhibited maximal efficacy while minimizing the risk of hematologic toxicity. This bispecific stimulated robust anti-tumor responses in multiple xenograft models of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Our approach can be directly applied to other cancers to rapidly discover bispecific antibodies that leverage anti-tumor responses by macrophages or other innate immune cells.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age.

We developed  tissue clocks--predictors of biological age based on tissue images--which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts.

This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Notably, deeply quiescent NSCs with astrocytic features display a unique activation phenotype that combines the maintenance of astrocytic markers with the rapid upregulation of activation and neuronal commitment genes, reminiscent to murine periventricular astrocytes activating upon lesion.

Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post-hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, particularly those caused by H5N1 and its variants, have surged since their first occurrence in 1959. The HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have notably expanded its geographical reach, affecting numerous countries, diverse avian species, and now wild and domestic mammals. Using an ecological niche modelling approach, this study aims to elucidate the environmental factors associated with the increased HPAI H5 cases since 2020, investigate potential shifts in ecological niches, and predict new areas suitable for local viral circulation. Focusing on H5N1 and H5Nx strains, we have developed ecological niche models for HPAI case in both wild and domestic birds while considering two distinct periods: 2015-2020 and 2020-2022. Key environmental predictors include chicken and duck population density, human density, distance to water bodies, and several land cover variables. Post-2020, we observe a notable increase in the relative importance of some of these predictors, such as intensive chicken population density and cultivated vegetation. The resulting risk maps reveal notable ecological suitability for local HPAI H5 circulation in Europe, Asia, as well as North and South America, with notable expansions of the areas at risk post-2020. The spatial distribution of HPAI H5 occurrences in wild birds appears to be primarily influenced by urban areas and open water regions. Overall, global risk maps derived from our models identify regions at risk where surveillance and control measures should be prioritised. Finally, our analyses also highlight a shift in the diversity of species affected by HPAI outbreaks, with a higher variety of avian species, particularly sea birds, being impacted post-2020. This increased diversity suggests that ecological shifts in HPAI H5 circulation may be accompanied by a broader range of susceptible species. Overall, these results further contribute to the understanding of HPAI epidemiology.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, these circuits are often specifically tailored to particular cellular hosts, with Escherichia coli being the most popular. Consequently, their intended functions may not translate well to other organisms, limiting their scope. Understanding circuit dynamics in less familiar organisms is crucial, especially for niche-specific applications requiring cellular chassis different from model organisms generally used in synthetic biology. Here, we develop a combined experimental and theoretical pipeline to evaluate the performance of NOT logic circuits, also called inverters, in the soil bacterium Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5, a host renowned for its unique environmental functions and a newcomer to genetic circuitry. Inverters were experimentally tested to characterize input-output functionality, and mathematical modelling was used to infer the dynamic principles of circuit modules. The model quantified the individual impacts of key parameters - such as translation efficiency, repressor performance, and promoter activity - on output levels, enabling predictions about inter-host circuit portability. This parameter calibration revealed unique properties of the chassis, including faster transitions between on and off circuit states compared to the synthetic biology workhorse Pseudomonas putida. These characteristics may reflect adaptations to the fluctuating conditions of the plant rhizosphere, where this bacteria thrives. As a result, our work provides DNA parts, circuits and mathematical characterizations to establish P. protegens Pf-5 as a viable chassis for environmental synthetic biology.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

While this technique holds significant potential for clinical and cognitive applications, the causal mechanisms underlying successful DecNef regulation and the neural dynamics that distinguish successful learners from those who struggle remain poorly understood. To address this question, we conducted a meta-study across functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from five DecNef experiments, each with multiple fMRI sessions, to reveal causal network dynamics associated with individual differences in neurofeedback performance. Using the newly proposed CaLLTiF causal discovery method, we computed causal maps to identify causal network patterns that distinguish DecNef regulation from baseline and account for variations in neurofeedback success. We found that enhanced connectivity within the bilateral control network--particularly stronger connections involving the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortex--predicted neurofeedback success across all five studies. Whole-brain causal connectivity during DecNef further exhibited distinct network reorganizations, characterized by reduced average path lengths and increased right-limbic nodal degrees. Further, comparisons across cognition- and perception-targeted DecNef revealed a remarkable separation in connections to and from the somatomotor network, where connections between somatomotor and control-default-attention networks are larger during cognitive neurofeedback while causal effects between somatomotor and subcortical-visual-limbic networks are larger during perceptive DecNef. This is despite the fact that none of the involved studies targeted or involved motor activity. Overall, our results demonstrated the key role of bilateral medial control network in successful DecNef regulation regardless of the DecNef targets, a clear separation in somatomotor involvement between cognitive and perceptive DecNef, and general promise of whole-brain causal discovery in understanding complex neural processes such as decoded neurofeedback.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

By leveraging 4D lattice light sheet microscopy and correlative light and electron tomography, we define a quantitative and ultrastructural timeline of nuclear macroautophagy (nucleophagy) in yeast. Nucleophagy begins with a rapid accumulation of the selective autophagy receptor Atg39 at the nuclear envelope and finishes in [~]300 seconds with Atg39-cargo delivery to the vacuole. Although there are several routes to the vacuole, at least one pathway incorporates two consecutive membrane fission steps: inner nuclear membrane (INM) fission to generate an INM-derived vesicle in the perinuclear space and outer nuclear membrane (ONM) fission to liberate a double membraned vesicle to the cytosol. ONM fission occurs independently of phagophore engagement and instead relies surprisingly on dynamin like 1 (Dnm1), which is recruited to sites of Atg39 accumulation by Atg11. Loss of Dnm1 compromises nucleophagic flux by stalling nucleophagy after INM fission. Our findings reveal how nuclear and INM cargo are removed from an intact nucleus without compromising its integrity, achieved in part by a non-canonical role for Dnm1 in nuclear envelope remodeling.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

We show that Sla2 has two independent binding sites for CLC: one previously described in homologs of Fungi (Sla2) and Metazoa (Hip1R), and a second found only in Fungi.

Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) provides a unique opportunity to test therapies in presymptomatic individuals.

METHODSUsing data from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN), sample sizes for clinical trials were estimated for various cognitive, imaging, and CSF outcomes.

RESULTSBiomarkers measuring amyloid and tau pathology had required sample sizes below 200 participants per arm (examples CSF A{beta}42/40: 22[95%CI 13,46], cortical PIB 32[20,57], CSF p-tau181 58[40,112]) for a four-year trial to have 80% power (5% statistical significance) to detect a 25% reduction in absolute levels of pathology, allowing 40% dropout. For cognitive, MRI, and FDG, it was more appropriate to detect a 50% reduction in rate of change.

Transducing bacteriophage (phage) particles and gene transfer agents (GTAs) are constrained by their capsids' structural properties in the length of host DNA they can package. This results in a narrow distribution of DNA fragment lengths associated with a given viral carrier. Single molecule nanopore sequencing of intact capsid-packaged single DNA molecules with full genome-sized reads can be used to establish the precise lengths and identity of individual packaged DNA molecules and their association with specific bacterial hosts and virus-like agents. The approach developed in this study was validated using a selection of well-characterised transducing phages and a GTA-like element, and then applied to study bacterial DNA encapsidation in the faecal microbiomes from three healthy human donors. Bacterial DNA encapsidation by viruses and virus-like particles appears to be widespread in the microbiome with up to 5.4% of capsid-packaged DNA in the gut virome being of bacterial (non-prophage) origin. Generalised transduction and GTA activity are especially prevalent in the families Ospillospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (genera Faecalibacterium, Gemmiger, Onthomonas), whereas an example of lateral transduction was observed in genus Bacteroides. In addition to that, induction of prophages in a variety of highly prevalent anaerobic bacteria was observed. Further work will be needed to understand biological significance of capsid-mediated DNA packaging in the gut microbiome and its role in community structure, evolution on ecological timescales, spread of beneficial and detrimental genes, as well as its possible role in gastrointestinal disease.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Here, we attempted the mass isolation of root endophytic fungi to evaluate the recovery of known plant-beneficial Helotiales lineages using a tailored culture-based approach. We sampled six wild non-mycorrhizal species from the Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, and Cyperaceae, growing in nutrient-limited alpine soils. We isolated 602 root endophytes and compared this culturable diversity with the one observed via fungal ITS2 metabarcoding. Metabarcoding revealed that Helotiales taxa dominated the fungal communities, with 43% of these detected taxa also represented in our collection. Accordingly, most root endophytes in our collection (53%) were Helotiales. These isolates, some with P solubilisation potential, belonged primarily to three Helotialean clades and were phylogenetically related to plant growth-promoting or mycorrhizal-like strains. This analysis highlights that roots of alpine non-mycorrhizal plants are reservoirs of plant-beneficial root-endophytic Helotiales, and the isolates obtained are a promising resource to explore the plant-beneficial mechanisms and ecological traits of these fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

To enable in vitro investigation of human skin immunology, we developed a microfluidic human skin equivalent (HSE) that supports the delivery of circulating immune cells via a vascular microchannel embedded within the dermis of a full-thickness construct. We demonstrated that stimulation of keratinocyte inflammation with lipopolysaccharide and nigericin promoted rapid monocyte recruitment out of the vascular channel and into the epidermal layer within 24 hours, followed by a second wave of monocyte migration into the dermis over a period of six days. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the tissue-resident and recruited cell populations revealed dynamic and cell-specific patterns of gene expression that were characteristic of acute activation and resolution of an inflammatory immune response. Moreover, comparison of the gene signatures of the monocyte-derived cells to in vivo populations provided molecular level validation of the model and indicated a differentiation trajectory of the monocytes through to mature dermal macrophages. To extend the microfluidic platform to additional applications, we also modelled age-associated immune dysfunction by the inclusion of senescent fibroblasts, which promoted increased monocyte recruitment into the HSE, replicating previous in vivo human studies. Thus, the microfluidic HSE presented here replicates key aspects of dynamic inflammatory immune responses within the skin and represents a tractable experimental tool for interrogating mechanisms of human skin immunology.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Because chronic infections may last for decades, they have the potential to generate high levels of intraspecific variation through within-host diversification over time, and the potential for superinfections to occur through the introduction of multiple pathogen populations to the ongoing infection. Traditional methods for identifying infective agents generally involve isolating one single colony from a given sample, usually after selecting for a specific pathogen or antibiotic resistance profile. Isolating a recognized virulent or difficult to treat pathogen is an important part of informing clinical treatment and correlative research; however, these reductive methods alone, do not provide researchers or healthcare providers with the potentially important perspective on the true pathogen population structure and dynamics over time. To begin to address this limitation, in this study, we compare findings on Staphylococcus aureus single colonies versus and pools of colonies taken from fresh sputum samples from three patients with cystic fibrosis to isolates collected from the same sputum samples and processed by the clinical microbiology laboratory. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of isolated S. aureus populations revealed coexisting lineages in two of three sputum samples as well as population structures that were not reflected in the single colony isolates. Altogether, our observations presented here demonstrate that clinically relevant diversity can be missed with standard sampling methods when assessing chronic infections. More broadly, this work outlines the potential impact that comprehensive population-level sampling may have for both research efforts and more effective treatment practices.

The retina is particularly amenable to comparative analysis because the basic morphology, connectivity, and function of its six major cell classes have remained largely invariant since the earliest stages of vertebrate evolution. Here, we show that the retinas highly conserved cellular architecture is mirrored by deep conservation of the underlying cis-regulatory codes that control gene expression. We use comparative single-cell chromatin accessibility analysis of lamprey, fish, bird, and mammalian retinas-- representing over half a billion years of evolutionary divergence--to demonstrate cross-species conservation of cis-regulatory codes in all six retinal cell classes. This conservation persists despite extensive turnover of cis-regulatory regions between distant species. Conservation manifests as the clustering of multiple distinct high-affinity transcription factor (TF) binding sites toward the center of cell-class-specific open chromatin regions with little cross-species preservation of higher-order syntax. Hierarchical clustering of machine-learning models of retinal cis-regulatory codes from diverse species recovers six clusters corresponding to the six retinal cell classes. Thus, the retinas cellular Bauplan is controlled by cis-regulatory codes which predate the divergence of extant vertebrates and persist despite nearly complete enhancer turnover.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

We introduce a novel tool called TreeSort that accurately identifies recent and ancestral reassortment events on datasets with thousands of IAV whole genomes. The algorithm has immediate relevance to modern large-scale surveillance studies that generate thousands of whole genomes. TreeSort uses the phylogeny of a selected IAV segment as a reference and finds the branches on the phylogeny where reassortment has occurred with high probability by incorporating information from other gene segments. The tool reports the particular gene segments that were involved in reassortment and how different they are from prior gene pairings. Using TreeSort, we studied reassortment patterns of different IAV subtypes isolated in avian, swine, and human hosts. Avian IAV demonstrated more reassortment than human and swine IAV, with the avian H7 subtype displaying the most frequent reassortment. Reassortment in the swine and human H3 subtypes was more frequent than in the swine and human H1 subtypes, respectively. The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b had elevated reassortment rates in the 2020-2023 period; however, the surface protein-encoding genes (HA, NA, and MP) co-evolved together with almost no reassortment among these genes. We observed similar co-evolutionary patterns with very low rates of reassortment among the surface proteins for the human H1 and H3 lineages, suggesting that strong co-evolution and preferential pairings among surface proteins are a consequence of high viral fitness. Our algorithm enables real-time tracking of IAV reassortment within and across different hosts, can be applied to determine how specific genes evolve in response to reassortment events, and can identify novel viruses for pandemic risk assessment.

They play a vital role in maintaining ecological equilibrium and promoting the health of their hosts. Consequently, understanding the strain diversity within microbial communities is crucial, as variations between strains can lead to distinct phenotypic expressions or diverse biological functions. However, current methods for taxonomic classification from metagenomic sequencing data have several limitations, including their reliance solely on species resolution, support for either short or long reads, or their confinement to a given single species. Most notably, the majority of existing taxonomic classifiers rely solely on a single linear representative genome as a reference, which fails to capture the strain diversity, thereby introducing single-reference biases. Here, we present PanTax, a pangenome graph-based taxonomic classification method that overcomes the shortcomings of single-reference genome-based approaches, because pangenome graphs possess the capability to depict the genetic variability present across multiple evolutionarily or environmentally related genomes. PanTax provides a comprehensive solution to taxonomic classification for strain resolution, compatibility with both short and long reads, and compatibility with single or multiple species. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that PanTax drastically outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, primarily evidenced by its significantly higher precision or recall (at both species and strain levels), while maintaining comparable or better performance in other aspects across various datasets.

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

We analyzed the largely uncharacterized yeast RBP Pin4, and its involvement in adaptation to glucose depletion. A UV crosslinking technique to identify protein-RNA interactions (reCRAC) revealed that in glucose conditions Pin4 selectively binds a specific motif in 3 UTRs of mRNAs involved in glycolysis, amino acid, and mitochondrial metabolism. Following glucose withdrawal, Pin4-RNA binding was greatly reduced, with residual binding favoring transcripts associated with protein translation. Cells lacking Pin4 were greatly impaired in recovery from nutrient starvation and hypersensitive to oxidative stress, consistent with the mRNA targets. RNAseq and reporter assays indicated that loss of Pin4 caused increased target mRNA abundance. In wildtype yeast, glucose depletion induces ""diauxic shift"", with massive changes in transcription patterns. Very unexpectedly, this response was almost entirely abolished in cells lacking Pin4, or carrying a point mutation in its RNA-recognition motif. We conclude that Pin4 contributes to energy homeostasis by regulating post-transcriptional and transcriptional responses, and postulate that this key stress response pathway is riboregulated.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, within individual brain areas, neurons often exhibit very diverse and seemingly disorganized responses. A more careful analysis shows that these neurons can sometimes be grouped together into specialized subpopulations (categorical representations). Organization can also be found at the level of the representational geometry in the activity space, typically in the form of low-dimensional structures. It is still unclear how the geometry in the activity space and the structure of the response profiles of individual neurons are related. Here, we systematically analyzed the geometric and selectivity structure of the neural population from 40+ cortical regions in mice performing a decision-making task (IBL public Brainwide Map data set). We used a reduced-rank regression approach to quantify the selectivity profiles of single neurons and multiple measures of dimensionality to characterize the representational geometry of task variables. We then related these measures within single areas to the position of each area in the sensory-cognitive cortical hierarchy. Our findings reveal that only a few regions (in primary sensory areas) are categorical. When multiple brain areas are considered, we observe clustering that reflects the brain's large-scale organization. The representational geometry of task variables also changed along the cortical hierarchy, with higher dimensionality in cognitive regions. These trends were explained by analytical computations linking the maximum dimensionality of representational geometry to the clustering of selectivity at the single neuron level. Finally, we computed the shattering dimensionality (SD), a measure of the linear separability of neural activity vectors; remarkably, the SD remained near maximal across all regions, suggesting that the observed variability in the selectivity profiles allows neural populations to maintain high computational flexibility. These results provide a new mathematical and empirical perspective on selectivity and representation geometry in the cortical neural code.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

In deep-sea cold seep ecosystems, where diverse microbial communities thrive, quorum sensing is likely a key mechanism driving microbial interactions. However, the distribution, mechanisms, and ecological roles of quorum sensing in cold seeps remain poorly understood. To address this, we analyzed 173 metagenomes, 33 metatranscriptomes, and 18 metabolomes from 17 global cold seep sites. We identified 299,355 quorum sensing genes from the seep non-redundant gene catalog, representing 34 gene types across six quorum sensing systems, with distribution patterns influenced by sediment depth and seep type. These quorum sensing genes were present in 3,576 metagenome-assembled genomes from 12 archaeal and 108 bacterial phyla, revealing a complex network of intraspecies and interspecies communication. Microbial groups involved in key metabolic processes, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, diazotrophs and organohalide reducers, were extensively regulated by quorum sensing, influencing biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Phylogenetic analysis and protein domain identification highlighted the functional roles of key quorum sensing-related proteins (e.g., PDEs, CahR, RpfC/G and LuxR) in modulating microbial behaviors, such as motility and chemotaxis. Heterologous expression and metabolomic profiling further confirmed the activity of representative LuxI-R pairs and identified inhibitors of quorum sensing in cold seep sediments. Overall, these findings highlight complexity and significance of quorum sensing in microbial interactions, ecological adaptation, and biogeochemical cycling within cold seep ecosystems, advancing our understanding of microbial communication in the deep biosphere.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

In previous studies, it was shown that E. histolytica can break down pre-established biofilms of B. subtilis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Inhibiting parasitic cysteine proteases impairs biofilm degradation. However, it is still unknown whether bacteria can sense this process and respond to the degradation of the biofilms. Here, our research demonstrates a multi-layered response of probiotic bacteria to the parasite, which differs between planktonic bacteria and pre-established biofilms. Sensing the activity of cysteine proteases from E. histolytica, the bacteria activate the general stress response and, to a lesser extent, the cell wall stress response, making the surviving biofilm members more resistant to mild stressors. On the other hand, planktonic cells exposed to the predators' lysate deactivate the expression of genes associated with biofilm formation while inducing their motility to avoid predation. Overall, our results indicate that bacteria have evolved to recognize amoeba predators. Furthermore, the partially digested biofilm cells may have unexpected disadvantages over bacteria that did not encounter a predator. These findings may be useful in developing more efficient probiotic strains that are resilient to amoebiasis.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

By training SAEs on embeddings from the PLM ESM-2, we identify up to 2,548 human-interpretable latent features per layer that strongly correlate with up to 143 known biological concepts such as binding sites, structural motifs, and functional domains. In contrast, examining individual neurons in ESM-2 reveals up to 46 neurons per layer with clear conceptual alignment across 15 known concepts, suggesting that PLMs represent most concepts in superposition. Beyond capturing known annotations, we show that ESM-2 learns coherent concepts that do not map onto existing annotations and propose a pipeline using language models to automatically interpret novel latent features learned by the SAEs. As practical applications, we demonstrate how these latent features can fill in missing annotations in protein databases and enable targeted steering of protein sequence generation. Our results demonstrate that PLMs encode rich, interpretable representations of protein biology and we propose a systematic framework to extract and analyze these latent features.

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes relevant to many physiological and pathological processes. As with all members of the steroid receptor family, GR forms condensates of unknown function. Here, we examine whether GR condensates are involved in transcription regulation using Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and nano-antibodies targeting initiation and elongating states of RNA polymerase II (Pol2). We observed subpopulations of GR condensates colocalizing with initiating and, surprisingly, elongating Pol2 foci. The analysis of GR mutants with different transcriptional outputs suggests a correlation between condensate formation capability and transcription initiation. Moreover, the number of GR molecules within initiation and elongation condensates appears to be linked to transcriptional activity. Taken together, our data suggests an involvement of GR condensates in transcription initiation and elongation.

The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes. Single cell RNA sequencing after coculture highlights a general response of T cells to the epithelial microenvironment, and more particularly, an increase activation of a pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells effector population in CD patients compared to controls.

Slight deviations in the contact point on the ball can result in weakly hit balls that do not result in opportunities for batters to score. Even before the pitcher releases the ball, the batter has some belief (an estimated distribution-a  prior), of where the ball may land in the strike zone. Batters will update this prior belief with information from observing the pitch (the  likelihood) to calculate their final estimate (the  posterior). These models of behavior, called Bayesian models within movement science, predict that players will estimate a final ball position by combining prior information with observation of the pitch in a way that weights each information source relative to the uncertainty. Here we test this model using data from more than a million samples from professional baseball. Moreover, as predicted by a Bayesian model, we show that a batters estimate of where to swing is biased towards the prior when prior information is available ( pitch tipping), and biased towards the likelihood in the case of pitches with high movement uncertainty. These results demonstrate that Bayesian ideas are relevant well beyond laboratory experiments and matter for real-world movements.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Genealogy-based association methods have the potential to bridge this gap by testing combinations of common and rare haplotypes based purely on their ancestral relationships. In parallel work we developed an efficient local ancestry inference engine and a novel statistical method (LOCATER) for combining signals present on different branches of a locus specific haplotype tree. Here, we developed a genome-wide LOCATER analysis pipeline and applied it to a genome sequencing study of 6,795 Finnish individuals with 101 cardiometabolic traits and 18.9 million autosomal variants. We identified 351 significant trait associations at 47 genomic loci and found that LOCATER boosted single marker test (SMT) association power at 5 loci by combining independent signals from distinct alleles. LOCATER successfully recovered known quantitative trait loci not found by SMT, including LIPG, recovered known allelic heterogeneity at the APOE/C1/C4/C2 gene cluster, and suggested one novel association. We find that confounders have a more pronounced effect on genealogy-based methods than SMT; we propose a new randomization approach and a general method for genomic control to eliminate their effects. This study demonstrates that genealogy-based methods such as LOCATER excel when multiple causal variants are present and suggests that their application to larger and more diverse cohorts will be fruitful.","NA","medrxiv",1732054175324

Inside mitochondria, SAM-dependent methylations occur at several steps of gene expression, but their role and significance remain unclear. Using direct long-read RNA sequencing on mouse tissue and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial ribosomal gene cluster is not efficiently processed without mitochondrial SAM. This results in the accumulation of unprocessed ribosomal RNA precursors. Protein profiling of ribosome fractions revealed that these precursors are associated with processing and ribosome assembly factors, indicating stalling at an early stage. Structural analysis of the mitochondrial ribosome by cryogenic electron microscopy revealed that mitochondrial SAM is required during peptidyl transferase centre formation and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Our data thus identify a critical role for methylation at two steps during mitochondrial gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Historically considered to be invariant machines, ribosomes differ in composition between tissues and developmental stages, incorporating a diversity of ribosomal proteins (RP) encoded by duplicated paralogous genes. Here, we use Drosophila to systematically investigate the origins and functions of non-canonical RP paralogues. We show that new paralogues mainly originated through retroposition, and that only a few new copies retain coding capacity over time. Although transcriptionally active non-canonical RP paralogues often present tissue-specific expression, we show that the majority of those are not required for either viability or fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. The only exception, RpS5b, which is required for oogenesis, is functionally interchangeable with its canonical paralogue, indicating that the RpS5b-/- phenotype results from insufficient ribosomes rather than the absence of an RpS5b-specific, functionally-specialised ribosome. Altogether our results provide evidence that, instead of new functions, RP gene duplications provide a means to regulate ribosome levels during development.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Despite this well-known link, we still know little about underlying age-related epigenetic differences, which could help us better understand inter-individual variation in aging and the etiology, onset, and progression of age-associated disease. Dogs exhibit this negative correlation between size, health, and longevity and thus represent an excellent system in which to test the underlying mechanisms. Here, we quantified genome-wide DNA methylation in a cohort of 864 dogs in the Dog Aging Project. Age strongly patterned the dog epigenome, with the majority (66% of age-associated loci) of regions associating age-related loss of methylation. These age effects were non-randomly distributed in the genome and differed depending on genomic context. We found the LINE1 (long interspersed elements) class of TEs (transposable elements) were the most frequently hypomethylated with age (FDR < 0.05, 40% of all LINE1 regions). This LINE1 pattern differed in magnitude across breeds of different sizes- the largest dogs lost 0.26% more LINE1 methylation per year than the smallest dogs. This suggests that epigenetic regulation of TEs, particularly LINE1s, may contribute to accelerated age and disease phenotypes within a species. Since our study focused on the methylome of immune cells, we looked at LINE1 methylation changes in golden retrievers, a breed highly susceptible to hematopoietic cancers, and found they have accelerated age-related LINE1 hypomethylation compared to other breeds. We also found many of the LINE1s hypomethylated with age are located on the X chromosome and are, when considering X chromosome inactivation, counter-intuitively more methylated in males. These results have revealed the demethylation of LINE1 transposons as a potential driver of inter-species, demographic-dependent aging variation.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, an imperfect test can also fail to exclude from the control group people that do not represent the source population, including people infected with other influenza types or other vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses for which vaccination status is correlated. We investigated these biases by comparing the effectiveness of seasonal 2023/24 influenza vaccination against influenza A and B based on PCR versus rapid test results, excluding controls who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or the other type of influenza. By PCR, VE against influenza A was 49% (95%CI 26-65%) after exclusion of PCR-confirmed influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 controls. Corresponding VE against influenza B was 65% (95%CI 35-81%). VE estimated by adjusting for COVID-19 vaccination status yielded similar estimates to the scenario that excluded SARS-CoV-2-positive controls. When case/control status and exclusions from test-negative controls were determined by rapid test, VE was reduced by 5-15 percentage points. Bias correction methods were able to reduce these discrepancies. When estimating VE from a test-negative study using rapid test results, methods to correct misclassification bias are recommended.","NA","medrxiv",1732054175324

Our toolbox can detect less than 3x10-7 ng of DNA (100 attoMolar) or 102 CFU/mL. High concordance was observed when comparing the C12a toolbox with sequenced genomes and antibiotic susceptibility tests for the blaCTX-M-15 and floR antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which confer resistance to cefotaxime and other {beta}-lactams, and amphenicols, respectively. C12aINT, designed to detect the Integrase 1 gene, confirmed a high prevalence of the integrase/integron system in E. coli containing multiple ARGs. The C12a toolbox was tested across a wide range of laboratory infrastructure including a portable setup. When combined with lateral flow assays (LFA), C12a exhibited competitive performance, making it a promising solution for on-site ARG detection.

Weights learned were normally distributed with a wider spread and multimodal distribution for rooms with uneven, larger or multiple firing fields. We conclude that each place cell is connected to single modules of grid cells with similar spatial firing frequency. Place cells connected to multi-frequency grid cells are fewer. Our results also show that grid cells resolve the space into spatial distance, orientation, and phase offset. Unique firing patterns of the place cells codify each room with this information.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is a methyl group donor for most methylations in the cell and is synthesized from methionine and ATP. After methylation, SAM is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine, which is further metabolized to adenosine and homocysteine. Here, we show that the SAM transmethylation pathway is up-regulated during immune cell activation and that the adenosine produced by this pathway in immune cells acts as a systemic signal to delay Drosophila larval development and ensure sufficient nutrient supply to the immune system. We further show that the up-regulation of the SAM transmethylation pathway and the efficiency of the immune response also depend on the recycling of adenosine back to ATP by adenosine kinase and adenylate kinase. We therefore hypothesize that adenosine may act as a sensitive sensor of the balance between cell activity, represented by the sum of methylation events in the cell, and nutrient supply. If the supply of nutrients is insufficient for a given activity, adenosine may not be effectively recycled back into ATP and may be pushed out of the cell to serve as a signal to demand more nutrients.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

We show that 1) the complex domain is required to analyze phase coherence in its entirety, 2) statistical models for complex-valued phase coherence, particularly the complex angular central gaussian (ACG) distribution, greatly exceeds performance over models for time-series data, rank-2 cosine phase coherence maps, or the leading eigenvector of cosine phase coherence maps (i.e., LEiDA), 3) methods should account for the inherent anisotropy of the brain's interconnections. We emphasize the need to utilize models that account for the manifold on which the data reside, and show that the proposed models provide valuable information about intrinsic functional connectivity networks and can easily distinguish task-related brain function. We provide an open-source, Python-based toolbox (""Phase Coherence Mixture Modeling"" (PCMM): github.com/anders-s-olsen/PCMM) to facilitate and promote implementation of these models.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures4-7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, the effectiveness of this technique is contingent upon accurate peak identification, necessitating the use of optimal peak calling methods tailored to the unique characteristics of CUT&RUN data. Here, we benchmark four prominent peak calling tools, MACS2, SEACR, GoPeaks, and LanceOtron, evaluating their performance in identifying peaks from CUT&RUN datasets. Our analysis utilizes in-house data of three histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) from mouse brain tissue, as well as samples from the 4D Nucleome database. We systematically assess these tools based on parameters such as the number of peaks called, peak length distribution, signal enrichment, and reproducibility across biological replicates. Our findings reveal substantial variability in peak calling efficacy, with each method demonstrating distinct strengths in sensitivity, precision, and applicability depending on the histone mark in question. These insights provide a comprehensive evaluation that will assist in selecting the most suitable peak caller for high-confidence identification of regions of interest in CUT&RUN experiments, ultimately enhancing the study of chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

One novel, potentially informative model system is the Lord Howe Island Group of Australia. Despite the World Heritage status of this archipelago, almost nothing is known of the biogeographic origins, evolutionary distinctiveness or genetic diversity of the ecological communities across its 28 islands. In this study, we focused on the cockroach Panesthia lata, an ecologically specialized invertebrate with one of the broadest recorded distributions of any LHIG species. To investigate the influence of Pleistocene sea-level fluctuations on LHIG fauna, we explored the phylogeography of P. lata using single-nucleotide polymorphisms and complete mitochondrial genomes. Our analyses reveal that the lineage on the permanently isolated islet Balls Pyramid is highly divergent from the remaining populations, while those on the episodically connected Lord Howe, Roach and Blackburn Islands experienced gene flow during the last glacial period. These results offer the first evidence that Pleistocene land bridges allowed for overland migration across the archipelago. Further, although P. lata was believed to have been locally extirpated by rodents on Lord Howe Island, we discovered two surviving, relict populations. We also detected high levels of inbreeding in all populations, emphasizing the need for ongoing conservation management. Finally, the combination of shallow genetic structure and low diversity suggests that genetic rescue from another island may be a viable strategy to conserve the Lord Howe Island population of P. lata, as well as other species that have been similarly impacted by rodents.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

We identified a homozygous human WNT11 variant in an infant with Situs inversus totalis, complex heart defects and renal hypodysplasia, and we used Xenopus embryos to functionally characterize this variant. WNT11c.814delG encodes a loss-of-function protein with reduced stability that lost signaling activity in vivo. This is remarkable, because the variant encodes a truncated ligand with nearly identical length and predicted structure to dominant-negative Wnts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the truncated C-terminal end can restore stability and dominant-negative signaling activity. Our study also suggests similar functions for WNT11 in human development as described in model organisms. Therefore, biallelic WNT11 dysfunction should be considered as novel genetic cause in syndromal human phenotypes presenting with congenital heart defects and renal hypoplasia, with or without laterality defects.

The virus's ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans.

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

SOX2 is one of the key pluripotency transcription factors, expressed during embryonic development and active in adult stem cells. In cancer, SOX2 is frequently dysregulated and associated with tumor stemness and poor patient survival. SOX2 expression is suppressed in differentiated cells by tumor suppressor proteins that form a transcriptional repressive complex. We previously identified some of these proteins and found that their absence combined with deficiency in Trp53, leads to maximal dysregulated expression of Sox2. Using cancer cell lines of different origin and with different p53 status, we show here that manipulating TP53 to restore or decrease its activity results in repression or induction of SOX2, respectively. Mechanistically, we observed that the regulation of SOX2 expression by TP53 is transcriptional and identified Trp53 bound to the promoter region and the SRR2 enhancer of Sox2. Forcing high levels of SOX2 in cancer cells leads to morphological changes that molecularly correspond to the acquisition of a more mesenchymal phenotype correlating with an increased migratory capacity. Finally, the analysis of human breast cancer samples shows that this correlation between TP53 status, levels of expression of SOX2 and a more metastatic phenotype is also observed in cancer patients. Our results support the notion that lack of TP53 in tumor cells results in deregulated expression of developmental gene SOX2 with phenotypic consequences related with increased malignization.

However, whether 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in non-human mammals can establish human infections and spread among humans is unclear. Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals. Overall, our study delineates human adaptation and infection risk of specific non-human mammalian circulating HPAI 2.3.4.4b H5N1 strains.

However, metagenome-assembled genomes are often incomplete and have low contiguity due to challenges in assembling repeated genomic elements. Long-read sequencing approaches have successfully yielded circular bacterial genomes directly from metagenomes, but these approaches are low throughput, have high DNA input requirements, and can have high error rates. Illumina has recently launched the Illumina Complete Long Read (ICLR) assay, a new approach for generating kilobase-scale reads with low DNA input requirements and high accuracy. Here, we evaluate the performance of ICLR sequencing for gut metagenomics. We sequenced a microbial mock community and ten human gut microbiome samples with standard, shotgun 2x150 paired-end sequencing, ICLR sequencing, and nanopore long-read sequencing and compared performance in read lengths, assembly contiguity, and bin quality. We find that ICLR human metagenomic assemblies have higher N50 (119.5 {+/-} 24.8 kilobases) than short read assemblies (9.9 {+/-} 4.5 kilobases; p = 0.002), and comparable N50 to nanopore assemblies (91.0 {+/-} 43.8 kilobases; p = 0.32). Additionally, we find that ICLR draft microbial genomes are more complete (94.0% {+/-} 20.6%) than nanopore draft genomes (85.9% {+/-} 23.0%; p[&le;] 0.001), and that nanopore draft genomes have truncated gene lengths (924.6 {+/-} 114.7 base pairs) relative to ICLR genomes (954.6 {+/-} 71.5 base pairs; p[&le;] 0.001). Overall, we find that ICLR sequencing is a promising method for high-throughput and accurate assembly of microbial genomes from gut metagenomes.

ImportanceMetagenomic sequencing allows scientists to directly measure the genome content and structure of microbes residing in complex microbial communities. Traditional short-read metagenomic sequencing methods often yield fragmented genomes, whereas advanced long-read sequencing methods improve genome assembly quality but often suffer from high error rates and are logistically limited due to low throughput and high input requirements. A new method, the Illumina Complete Long Read Assay (ICLR), is capable of generating highly-accurate kilobase-scale sequencing reads with minimal input material. To evaluate the utility of ICLR in metagenomic contexts, we applied short-read, long-read, and ICLR methods to simple and complex microbial communities. We found that ICLR outperforms short-read methods, and yields comparable metagenomic assemblies to standard long-read approaches while requiring less input material. Overall, ICLR represents a high-throughput and efficient solution for assembling complete genomes from complex metagenomes.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175324

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.

ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYThe Omicron JN.1- and KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines encoding prefusion S proteins elicit similar preclinical neutralizing antibody responses against circulating JN.1 sublineage pseudoviruses that are more potent than those elicited by past iterations of BNT162b2 licensed vaccines, thus demonstrating the importance of annual strain changes to the COVID-19 vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

Centrosomes consist of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). In Caenorhabditis elegans, interactions between the PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 and the regulatory kinase PLK-1 are essential for PCM formation and disassembly. However, how PCM stability is established and maintained remains an open question. Here, we address this question by analyzing the function of PCMD-1, a protein that predominantly localizes to centrioles. Mutations in the predicted PLK-1 binding sites of PCMD-1 result in a reduction of centrosomal PLK-1 and PCMD-1 levels, leading to severe distortion of the PCM scaffold. The disorganization of the PCM is already evident during its formation and results in the assembly of a structurally unstable mitotic centrosome, which is unable to resist the microtubule pulling forces exerted on the spindle pole. As a consequence of a weakened PCM scaffold, the pulling forces are not effectively relayed to the entrapped centriole pair, resulting in delayed centriole separation in late anaphase. Together, these findings show that PCMD-1, which predominantly localizes to centrioles and tethers the PCM scaffold to them, is essential for stabilizing the entire PCM scaffold and ensuring timely centriole separation during PCM disassembly. We propose a model in which PCMD-1 initiates the ordered assembly of the PCM scaffold by biasing the PCM core to a certain intrinsic order around the centrioles. This intrinsic order acts as a seed that propagates throughout the surrounding micron-scale PCM scaffold, providing the necessary strength and structural integrity for the centrosome.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

However, detection currently requires costly whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or labor-intensive cytogenetic or FISH imaging, limiting its application in routine clinical diagnosis. To overcome this, we developed ecPath (ecDNA from histopathology), a computational method for predicting ecDNA status from routinely available hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. ecPath implements a deep-learning method we call transcriptomics-guided learning, which utilizes both transcriptomics and H&E images during the training phase to enable successful ecDNA prediction from H&E images alone, a task not achievable with models trained on H&E images only. It is trained on more than 6,000 tumor whole-slide images from the TCGA cohort with the best performance in predicting ecDNA status in brain and stomach tumors (average AUC=0.78). ecPath revealed that ecDNA-positive tumors are enriched with pleomorphic, larger and high-density nuclei. Testing in an independent cohort, ecPath predicted ecDNA status of 985 pediatric brain tumor patients with an AUC of 0.72. Finally, we applied ecPath to identify ecDNA-positive tumors in the TCGA cohort for which no WGS data were available. Like WGS-based ecDNA-positive labels, the predicted ecDNA-positive status also identify poor prognoses for low grade glioma patients. These results demonstrate that ecPath enables the detection of ecDNA from routinely available H&E imaging alone and help nominate aggressive tumors with ecDNA to study and target it.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

Conditions that disrupt the immune balance in the male reproductive tract, such as vasectomy and infections, can expose sperm to the immune system, leading to increased production of anti-sperm antibodies (ASAs) and subsequent reproductive challenges. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) regulate inflammation and maintain sperm tolerance. In a murine model, we demonstrated that disrupting sperm immunotolerance induces chronic autoimmune responses characterized by antibody production targeting sperm and reproductive tissue autoantigens and unique tissue-specific immune cell signatures in the epididymis and testis. Such inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive sustained male subfertility. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were formed within the epididymis after Treg depletion, defined by clusters of heterogenous B and T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These ectopic structures perpetuate inflammation and lower the activation threshold for future immune threats. Similar isotypes of autoantibodies were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting shared mechanistic pathways between mice and humans. Overall, we provide an in-depth understanding of the diverse B- and T-cell dynamics and TLS formation during epididymitis to develop precision-targeted therapies for infertility and chronic inflammation. Additionally, this immunological characterization of the epididymal microenvironment has the potential to identify novel targets for the development of male contraceptives.

We used public RNA sequencing data and reconstructed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with HP, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and healthy controls. After excluding TCR sequences likely to be related to common microbial exposures in patients with HP, we identified TCRs shared between patients with shared human leukocyte antigen alleles, indicating patients likely to have a common causative antigen.

Yet, in situ peptide identification remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims to integrate the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)-based parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) into MALDI imaging of peptides to enable multiplexed MS/MS imaging.

METHODSAn initial MALDI TIMS MS1 survey measurement is performed, followed by a manual generation of a precursor list containing mass over charge values and ion mobility windows. Inside the dual TIMS system, submitted precursors are trapped, separately eluted by their ion mobility and analyzed in a quadrupole time-of-flight device, thereby enabling multiplexed MALDI MS/MS imaging. Finally, precursors are identified by peptide to spectrum matching.

RESULTSThis study presents the first multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm-PASEF) of tryptic peptides. Its applicability is showcased on two histomorphologically distinct tissue specimens in a 4-plex and 5-plex setup. Precursors were successfully identified by the search engine MASCOT in one single MALDI imaging experiment for each respective tissue. Peptide identifications were corroborated by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry experiments and fragment colocalization analyses.

CONCLUSIONSIn the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of TIMS-based MALDI MS/MS imaging for the multiplexed and rapid identification of tryptic peptides in a spatial manner.

Extreme precipitation events can promote the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses by creating vector habitat, destroying infrastructure, and impeding vector control. Here, we focus on Cyclone Yaku, which caused heavy rainfall in northwestern Peru from March 7th - 20th, 2023 and was followed by the worst dengue outbreak in Perus history. We apply generalized synthetic control methods to account for baseline climate variation and unobserved confounders when estimating the causal effect of Cyclone Yaku on dengue cases across the 56 districts with the greatest precipitation anomalies. We estimate that 67 (95% CI: 30 - 87) % of cases in cyclone-affected districts were attributable to Cyclone Yaku. The cyclone significantly increased cases for over six months, causing 38,209 (95% CI: 17,454 - 49,928) out of 57,246 cases. The largest increases in dengue incidence due to Cyclone Yaku occurred in districts with a large share of low-quality roofs and walls in residences, greater flood risk, and warmer temperatures above 24{degrees}C. Analyzing an ensemble of climate model simulations, we found that extremely intense March precipitation in northwestern Peru is 42% more likely in the current era compared to a preindustrial baseline due to climate forcing. In sum, extreme precipitation like that associated with Cyclone Yaku has become more likely with climate change, and Cyclone Yaku caused the majority of dengue cases across the cyclone-affected districts.

Significance StatementAnthropogenic climate change is increasing the risk of extreme events that can lead to infectious disease epidemics, but few studies have directly measured this health cost of climate change. We do so by focusing on Cyclone Yaku, which affected northwestern Peru in March 2023, and was immediately followed by a dengue epidemic. Cyclone Yaku caused 67% of cases reported over six months in the affected region. Industrial-era climate forcing has increased the likelihood of extreme March precipitation like that associated with Cyclone Yaku by 42%. Assessing the linkages between climate change, extreme weather, and outbreaks of dengue and other infectious diseases is crucial for understanding the impact that climate change has already had and preparing for future health risks.","NA","medrxiv",1732054175325

Compared to existing methods, real-time detection and long-term monitoring are still required. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have excellent optical properties for sensing applications, which provide the possibility for designing a new generation of glucose sensors. In this study, we describe a method for covalently conjugate glucose oxidase (GOx) on SWCNTs as an optical glucose sensor. The functional groups are introduced by a photocatalytic reaction which acts as the handle for protein loading on SWCNTs. In this sp3 defect reaction, the optical properties of SWCNTs can be maintained. With a convenient bioconjugation reaction, the GOx could be covalently linked with SWCNTs. Compared to the non-covalent immobilization conjugates, the covalent conjugate sensor exhibits a much stronger optical response toward glucose, and the stability of the biosensor also increases in harsh conditions. At the same time, we also report the changing ratio of the original E11 and defected E11* peak during the bioconjugation reaction, which is also inspiring for reaction monitoring on SWCNTs.

However, weight regain occurs when treatment is discontinued. An increase in skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency upon diet-mediated weight loss has been described, which may contribute to reduced systemic energy expenditure and weight regain. We set out to determine the unknown effect of semaglutide on muscle OXPHOS efficiency.

MethodsC57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks before receiving semaglutide or vehicle for 1 or 3 weeks. The rate of ATP production and O2 consumption were measured by a high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry to determine OXPHOS efficiency in skeletal muscle at these 2 timepoints.

ResultsSemaglutide treatment led to significant reductions in fat and lean mass. Semaglutide improved skeletal muscle OXPHOS efficiency, measured as ATP produced per O2 consumed (P/O) in permeabilized muscle fibers. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis revealed changes restricted to two proteins linked to complex III assembly (Lyrm7 and Ttc1, p <0.05 without multiple corrections) without substantial changes in the abundance of OXPHOS subunits.

ConclusionsThese data indicate that weight loss with semaglutide treatment increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency. Future studies could test whether it contributes to weight regain.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

However, the functional mechanisms of these proteins remain largely unexplored. In our previous research, we identified a CSP in aphid saliva, Mp10, from the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae, which functions as an effector protein modulating host plant immunity. Mp10 suppresses pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-triggered immunity (PTI), the first layer of plant defence, while also inducing effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Mp10 suppresses PTI. Our findings reveal that Mp10 interacts with AMSH deubiquitinase enzymes in plants, as shown by yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and FRET-FLIM assays, with these interactions predominantly localized to intracellular membranes. Mp10 was found to modulate the dynamics of membrane-bound PRR receptor kinases in plant cells. Co-IP and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that Mp10 and AMSH2 associate with a range of PRR kinases, PRR-associated kinases, and proteins involved in the intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins. Mp10 reduces the accumulation of these kinases at the cell surface by promoting their internalization to internal membranes, thereby dampening PTI. Supporting this, a dominant-negative catalytically inactive variant of AMSH2 also inhibits PTI. Interestingly, Mp10 orthologues from other sap-feeding hemipteran insects exhibit similar immune-suppressive activities, and our findings show that their interaction with plant AMSH proteins is conserved, indicating this immune-suppression mechanism is evolutionarily ancient.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

With the emergence of subclade Ib and increasing reported human-to-human transmission of MPXV we sought to characterize both the epidemiologic and genomic characteristics of confirmed mpox cases in Kinshasa, DRC, following confirmed MPXV introduction in August 2023.

MethodsThis retrospective observational study leveraged demographic and case-investigation data, as well as biological samples, collected from suspected mpox cases in Kinshasa from January 2023 to September 2024 as part of routine national surveillance. Samples were tested at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale first by qPCR to confirm MPXV, and subsequently sequenced for genomic analysis for those samples with a cycle threshold value <31.

FindingsEpidemiological characterization of all confirmed mpox cases in Kinshasa indicated two distinct periods of MPXV introduction and circulation: first, following the initial case in August 2023, self-limiting transmission chains of subclade Ia primarily among men. Case investigations from this period suggest human-human transmission. The second period is marked by the introduction of subclade Ib to the city and expanded co-circulation of both subclades - with Limete health zone reporting the most cases of both subclades. Of those samples sequenced, genomic analysis indicated that greater than 60% of mutations in both subclades were consistent with APOBEC3-driven mutations.

InterpretationThese data suggest that as of July 2024, MPXV in Kinshasa has undergone an epidemiological shift with sustained human-to-human transmission and co-circulation of two distinct subclades. Additionally, high rates of APOBEC3-driven changes further support this shift towards human-to-human transmission. While sexual-contact transmission cannot be confirmed without further case investigation, these data highlight important changes in mpox dynamics which may better guide mpox mitigation and containment strategies in Kinshasa.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

Evidence before this studyHistorically, human infections with Clade I monkeypox virus (MPXV) have been driven through zoonotic transmission with limited secondary transmission. However, sexual contact-mediated transmission of Clade I MPXV among a small cluster of cases was identified for the first time in Kwango Province, DRC, in mid-2023. We searched PubMed, bioRxiv, and medRxiv for articles published from database inception to 11 November 2024, with no language restrictions, using the terms ""mpox, monkeypox, Congo Basin, Clade I, AND outbreak"". All articles were published from 2010, with the majority published from 2022-2024, and included reviews, case reports, and laboratory investigations. Early reports on mpox outbreaks demonstrated that most infections resulted from zoonotic transmission events and the risks of sustained human-to-human transmission were considered to be very low. Assessment of human-to-human transmission of MPXV in the DRC between 1970-1980 and 1981-1986 suggested that there was no evidence for changes in secondary attack rates. This included a study of 93 MPXV-infected individuals who became symptomatic following close contact with mpox patients from 1981-1986 in DRC. Here, 69 cases resulted from transmission during the first virus generation, 19 in the second generation, and five cases in both the third and fourth generation. During the 1996-1997 mpox outbreak in DRC, it was reported that 73% of cases had contact with an mpox patient. A study of Clade I mpox in the Republic of the Congo from April-July 2003 suggested that up to seven sequential virus generations had occurred during the outbreak and was supported by the clustering of cases, uniform intervals of cases, and prior exposure histories of the patients. High secondary attack rates were also reported during an outbreak of Clade I mpox from July-December 2013 in the DRC where transmissions within the community were estimated to be [&ge;]7 virus generations. While these observations suggested potential increased patterns of human-to-human MPXV transmission, these continued to be linked to close, sustained contacts primarily within households and among caregivers. However, the first report of a cluster of mpox cases in DRC linked to sexual contacts in 2023 suggested that intimate contact, including through heterosexual and same-sex contacts, could result in Clade I MPXV transmission. Viral genome sequences isolated from this case cluster demonstrated the highest sequence similarity with a 2022 Clade I MPXV sequence from DRC. Subsequent investigation of surveillance data in South Kivu province, DRC, from September 2023 to January 2024 identified 241 suspected mpox cases that included sustained human-to-human transmission. Among PCR-confirmed mpox cases, the median age was 22 years with 29% of individuals identifying as sex workers. Genomic analysis identified a distinct clade I lineage, named as subclade Ib, with a predominance of APOBEC3 mutations. Rapid geographic expansion of subclade Ib has resulted in introduction of MPXV to multiple neighboring countries for the first time and including sustained chains of virus transmission, most notably in Burundi. Subclade Ia MPXV has undergone rapid and extensive geographic expansion in DRC since 2023. A recent longitudinal analysis of MPXV genomes from 2018-2024 demonstrated that all non-South Kivu Province sequences exhibited high genetic diversity, low incidences of APOBEC3 mutations as compared to subclade Ib, and likely resulted from multiple zoonotic introductions. Collectively, historic mpox case data and recent observations since 2023 have suggested that human mpox cases in DRC have been driven by zoonotic transmissions of subclade Ia and an increasing burden of sustained human-to-human transmissions of subclade Ib in Eastern DRC, with limited disease burden in Kinshasa.

Added value of this studyThis investigation demonstrates a shift in the epidemiology of subclade Ia group II MPXV outbreaks, which had previously been typified by multiple independent zoonotic introductions. Epidemiologic analysis indicated two distinct periods for the Kinshasa mpox outbreak - an initial period from August 2023 to June 2024 characterized by sporadic subclade Ia mpox case detections, and a second period from July 2024-October 2024 characterized by co-emergence of both subclade Ia and Ib. The majority of mpox cases were adult males. In contrast to historic observations, children <15 years were not the primary demographic overrepresented among the subclade Ia mpox cases with those aged 16-49 years accounting for 79% of cases in this study. This investigation sequenced samples from mpox-confirmed cases in Kinshasa, DRC, by generating 115 near-complete MPXV genomes accompanied by phylogenomic analysis. Our findings reveal an escalation of the Kinshasa mpox outbreak that includes the establishment of both subclade Ia (Group II) and subclade Ib MPXV. Subclade Ia introductions (n=11 samples belonging to 5 clusters within Group II) into Kinshasa were observed in 2023 and 2024 with limited local transmission chains. In this analysis, we estimate that 63% of mutations in subclade Ia and 66% of mutations in subclade Ib from MPXV genomes collected in Kinshasa were consistent with APOBEC3-driven changes, a hallmark of human-to-human transmission.

Implications of all the available evidenceThis study provides critical evidence for a rapid shift in subclade Ia MPXV epidemiology to include more sustained human-to-human transmission. While Clade I mpox cases have historically been linked to zoonotic transmissions, the recent emergence of subclade Ib in Eastern DRC coupled with our observations reported here for subclade Ia further complicate our understanding of Clade I MPXV transmission. These results have important public health implications for regional and international partners given Kinshasas role as an international travel hub and as the largest city on the continent. Observations of new sequences from Kwilu, Kwango, and Kongo-Central provinces (subclade Ia), as well as Kasai, Tanganyika and Tshopo (subclade Ib), linked to Kinshasa genomes further increase concerns regarding the broader risks for subclade Ia expansion, including within sexual networks.","NA","medrxiv",1732054175325

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1732054175325

Here, we applied an object detection algorithm to classify animal social behaviors. Our system, packaged as ""YORU"" (Your Optimal Recognition Utility), classifies animal behaviors, including social behaviors, based on the shape of the animal as a ""behavior object"". It successfully classified several types of social behaviors ranging from vertebrates to insects.

Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1732054175325
