While highly processed food like packaged products, processed meat, and sweetened soft drinks have been increasingly associated with unhealthy diet, information on the degree of processing characterizing an item in a store is not straight forward to obtain, limiting the ability of individuals to make informed choices. Here we introduce GroceryDB, a database with over 50,000 food items sold by Walmart, Target, and Wholefoods, unveiling how big data can be harnessed to empower consumers and policymakers with systematic access to the degree of processing of the foods they select, and the potential alternatives in the surrounding food environment. The extensive data gathered on ingredient lists and nutrition facts enables a large-scale analysis of ingredient patterns and degrees of processing, categorized by store, food category, and price range. Our findings reveal that the degree of food processing varies significantly across different food categories and grocery stores. Furthermore, this data allows us to quantify the individual contribution of over 1,000 ingredients to ultra-processing. GroceryDB and the associated http://TrueFood.Tech/ website make this information accessible, guiding consumers toward less processed food choices while assisting policymakers in reforming the food supply.","NA","medrxiv",1737324482997

The identification of new agents with differentiated pharmacokinetic and drug resistance profiles will increase therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients and bolster pandemic preparedness generally. Starting with a lead-like dihydrouracil chemotype from a large-library docking campaign, we improved MPro inhibition >1,000 fold by engaging additional subsites in the MPro active site, most notably by employing a latent propargyl electrophile to engage the catalytic Cys145. Advanced leads from this series, including AVI 4516 and AVI 4773 show pan-coronavirus antiviral activity in cells, very low clearance in mice, and for AVI 4773 a rapid reduction in viral titers more than a million fold after just three doses, more rapidly and effectively than the approved drugs, nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. Both AVI 4516 and AVI 4773 are well distributed in mouse tissues, including brain, where concentrations ten or fifteen-thousand times the EC90, respectively, are observed eight hours after an oral dose. As exemplar of the series, AVI 4516 shows minimal inhibition of major CYP isoforms and human cysteine and serine proteases, likely due to its latent electrophilic warhead. AVI 4516 also exhibits synergy in cellular infection models in combination with the RdRp inhibitor molnupiravir, while related analogs strongly inhibit nirmatrelvir-resistant MPro mutant virus in cells. The in vivo and antiviral properties of this new chemotype are differentiated from existing clinical and pre-clinical MPro inhibitors, and will advance new therapeutic development against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other coronaviruses.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

The availability of algae in culture poorly represents their large environmental diversity, and we still have a limited understanding of their convoluted evolution by endosymbiosis. Here, we performed a phylogeny-guided plastid genome-resolved metagenomic survey of Tara Oceans expeditions. We present a manually curated resource of nearly 700 new non-redundant plastid genomes of environmental pelagic algae. This catalogue vastly expands the plastid genome diversity within major algal groups, often corresponding to algae without closely related reference genomes. We also recovered four genomes, including one near complete, forming a deep-branching plastid lineage of nano-size algae (<5 um) that we informally named leptophytes. This group is globally distributed and generally rare, although it can reach relatively high abundance notably in the Arctic. Leptophytes encompass the enigmatic marine plastid group DPL2, one of the very few known plastid groups not clearly belonging to any major algal groups and for which only 16S amplicon data is available. Extensive phylogenetic analyses based on 93 plastid genes and gene content comparison firmly place leptophytes together with haptophytes and cryptophytes, although the exact relationships remain ambiguous. Collectively, our study demonstrates that metagenomics can reveal currently hidden diversity of organellar genomes, and shows the importance of including this diversity to improve models for plastid evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Here, we use a comprehensive and environmentally balanced collection of metagenomes to survey the defence landscape across complex microbial communities. We also assess the association between the viral community and the prevalence of defence systems. We identify strong environmental effects in predicting overall defence abundance, with animal-host-associated environments and hot environments harbouring more defences overall. We also find a positive correlation between the density and diversity of viruses in the community and the abundance of defence systems. This study provides insights into the ecological factors that influence the composition and distribution of bacterial defence systems in complex microbial environments and outlines future directions for the study of defence system ecology.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Here we present EcoPhylo, a computational workflow to characterize the phylogeography of any gene family through integrated analyses of genomes and metagenomes, and our application of this approach to ribosomal proteins to quantify phylogeny-aware genome recovery rates across three biomes. Our findings show that genome recovery rates vary widely across taxa and biomes, and that single amplified genomes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and isolate genomes have non-uniform yet quantifiable representation of environmental microbes.

The activity of individual L1 promoters is surprisingly divergent and correlates with an active epigenetic state. Efficient on-target CRISPRi silencing of L1s revealed nearly a hundred co-opted L1-derived chimeric transcripts and L1 silencing resulted in changes in neural differentiation programs and reduced cerebral organoid size.

We cultured networks of one, two, or three organoids on high-density microelectrode arrays, applied repetitive stimulation at two input locations from the microelectrodes, and monitored emergence of output signals that can decode the stimulus locations with machine learning algorithms. After two weeks of daily stimulation, networks of three organoids showed significantly higher stimulus decoding capability compared to the simpler one- or two-organoid networks. Long-term stimulation induced pronounced changes in the three-organoid network's response patterns, spontaneous activity, and inter- and intra-organoid functional connectivity. These findings underscore the importance of hierarchical network organization, e.g. creating distinct subnetworks with specialized roles, for stimuli-induced formation of circuits with robust input-output functionality.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

While the effects of plant domestication at the genetic and phenotypic levels are well-documented, its impact on plant microbiome remains less understood. Root microbiomes play crucial roles in nutrient acquisition, pathogen defense, and biotic stress tolerance, yet the influence of domestication on their diversity and assembly is still debated. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed: 1) the reduction in microbial diversity resulting from the domestication process, and 2) the diminished ability of host plants to control their microbiomes. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted a meta-analysis of multiple crops, comparing the root microbiomes of domesticated plants and their wild relatives. Our results indicate that the effects of domestication are species-specific and context-dependent, with most domesticated plants exhibiting increased microbial diversity and more structured communities, while others show no significant change. Overall, this study provides evidence that plant domestication does not lead to a uniform reduction in microbial diversity or a consistently diminished ability of plants to influence their microbiomes. Based on these findings, we discuss new perspectives and the need for future studies incorporating native soils and host genetic variation in such experiments, analyzing not only diversity but also microbiome function, and considering how root morphology might affect microbiome recruitment. Finally, we highlight the need for research on the potential adaptive or maladaptive consequences that introgression between wild and domesticated plants could have from a microbiome perspective.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Here, we sought to understand how new types of centromeres emerge and reach fixation by mapping centromere evolution across 138 budding yeast species and over 2,500 natural strain isolates. We show that new centromeres spread progressively via drift and subsequent selection, and that the kinetochore interface, which is evolving slowly in relative terms, determines which new centromere variants are tolerated.

Nevertheless, more often than not, vaccine candidates fail in advanced stages of development and clinical trials. A key reason is the poor predictive value of non-clinical in vivo and in vitro models, due to either species-specific differences in the immune response or insufficient reflection of physiological vaccine mechanisms. Reliable modeling of human adaptive immune responses is a prerequisite to understand processes leading to vaccine-induced protective immunization and to drive informed decisions in vaccine development pipelines. Here, we present a centrifugal microfluidics based organ-on-chip approach to generate an organotypic high density lymphoid tissue on-chip. The model enables long-term culture of lymphoid tissue and raised antigen-specific antibody responses against influenza vaccines even after four weeks on-chip. Antibody response of different magnitude and quality could be induced both by direct antigen exposure as well as by recruitment of antigen-presenting cells from the periphery. The model represents an attractive approach to evaluate the impact of the mode of antigen delivery on adaptive immune responses. Beyond applications in vaccine development, the lymphoid-tissue-on-chip provides a platform to study cellular interactions during homeostasis, immune responses and long-term impact of immunomodulators over several weeks.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Thymic output has been correlated with favorable prognosis in cancer patients across a range of ages, suggesting that the thymus is an important source for replenishing T cells capable of controlling cancer progression. However, the effector potential of thymic mature CD8+ T cells and their regulation have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identified the ability of thymic single positive CD8+ T cells to gain effector potential after thymic selection, but they are subject to the regulation of PD-1. We found a previously undisclosed role of PD-1 in limiting both the cytotoxic and exhaustion potential of thymic and peripheral CD8+ T cells. Our results show that although PD-1 inhibition facilitates the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells, effector CD8+ cells gradually lose their antitumor activity within tumor tissues due to advanced exhaustion in the absence of PD-1. Thus, although the preset effector potential in thymic mature CD8+ T cells allows them to rapidly respond to malignant cells in the periphery, PD-1, as a checkpoint, is embedded in the thymic mature CD8+ T cells after positive selection to balance their effector function from exaggeration and exhaustion. Therefore, we propose that a strategy capable of upholding the cytotoxic capacity and avoiding exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during the early stages of PD-1 inhibition therapy is needed to achieve durable antitumor immunity.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

The T. cruzi life cycle includes transitions between epimastigote, metacyclic trypomastigote, amastigote, and blood trypomastigote stages, each marked by distinct morphological and molecular adaptations to different hosts and environments. Unlike other trypanosomatids, T. cruzi does not employ antigenic variation but instead relies on a diverse array of cell-surface-associated proteins encoded by large multi-copy gene families (multigene families), essential for infectivity and immune evasion. This study analyzes cell-specific transcriptomes using single-cell RNA sequencing of amastigote and trypomastigote cells to characterize stage-specific surface protein expression during mammalian infection. Through clustering and identification of cell-specific markers, we assigned cells to distinct parasite developmental forms. Analysis of individual cells revealed that surface protein-coding genes, especially members of the trans-sialidase TcS superfamily (TcS), are expressed with greater heterogeneity than single-copy genes. Additionally, no recurrent combinations of TcS genes were observed between individual cells in the population. Our findings thus reveal transcriptomic heterogeneity within trypomastigote populations where each cell displays unique TcS expression profiles. Focusing on the diversity of surface protein expression, this research aims to deepen our understanding of T. cruzi cellular biology and infection strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

This condition encompasses a spectrum of liver disorders, ranging from simple steatosis to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), which is characterised by liver steatosis, lipotoxicity, hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. Left unchecked, MASLD/MASH can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the progressive nature of MASLD/MASH, current research primarily relies on static, histopathologically defined stages, which fail to capture the dynamic disease continuum. In this study, we present an integrative stratification approach that combines patient pseudo-temporal ordering, network analysis, and cell-type deconvolution to map the continuous disease trajectory. By analyzing transcriptomic profiles, we predict patients' positions along this trajectory, moving beyond conventional stage-based classifications. This approach reveals the sequence of critical molecular events driving MASLD/MASH progression, providing new insights into the disease's pathophysiology. Furthermore, we identify novel trajectory-specific biomarkers that support a more refined, personalised strategy for managing MASLD.

Phosphorylated tau accumulates in the LC and results in inflammation, synaptic loss, and eventually cell death in other brain regions as the disease progresses. Loss of LC neurons and noradrenergic innervation is thought to contribute to the symptoms of cognitive decline later in disease. While loss and degeneration of LC neurons has been well studied, less is known about changes in LC physiology at advanced stages of tau pathology that precedes neurodegeneration. In this study, we investigated the ex vivo electrophysiological properties of LC neurons in male and female mice from the P301S mouse model of tauopathy at 9 months of age, a time-point when significant tau accumulation, cell death, and cognitive impairments are observed. We found a reduction in excitatory inputs and changes in excitatory post-synaptic current kinetics in male and female P301S. There was also a decrease in spontaneous discharge of LC neurons and an increase in AP threshold in P301S mice of both sexes. Finally, we observed a decrease in excitability and increase in rheobase current in P301S mice. Despite the decrease in LC activity in slice, we did not identify differences in total tissue norepinephrine (NE) or NE metabolites in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus. Together these findings demonstrate reductions in the activity and excitability of LC neurons at late stages of tau accumulation. However, compensatory mechanisms may maintain normal NE levels in LC projection regions in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

However, little is known about exposures during pregnancy or the effect of clean cooking interventions on postpartum blood pressure trajectories. Methods: The Ghana Randomized Air Pollution and Health Study (GRAPHS) randomized 1414 non-smoking women in the first and second trimesters to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or improved biomass stoves - vs control (traditional three-stone open fire). Personal exposure to carbon monoxide was measured at four prenatal timepoints and three times over the first postpartum year. Participants were prospectively followed with annual resting BP measurements at 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years postpartum. We employed linear mixed effects models to determine effect of GRAPHS interventions on postpartum BP, and to examine associations between prenatal and postnatal CO and postpartum BP. Results: LPG intervention was associated with 3.54mmHg (95% CI -5.55, -1.53) lower change in systolic BP from enrolment through 8 years postpartum, and 2.27mmHg (95% CI -3.61, -0.93) lower change in diastolic BP from enrolment through 8 years postpartum, as compared to control. In exposure-response analysis, average prenatal CO was positively associated with change in systolic BP from enrolment ({beta}=0.71mmHg, 95% CI 0.08, 1.30, per doubling of CO) Conclusions: LPG cookstove intervention initiated in early pregnancy and maintained through the first postpartum year was associated with lower systolic and diastolic BP trajectories through 8 years postpartum. These findings support the need to integrate clean cooking solutions into existing antenatal care packages.","NA","medrxiv",1737324482997

This study reveals that LTA binds to multiple proteins involved in cell wall processes and preserves cell wall integrity by regulating one of the LTA-binding proteins, ScaH. ScaH is a peptidoglycan hydrolase predicted to have N-acetylglucosaminidase and amidase/peptidase activities. LTA inhibits ScaH's enzymatic activities by direct binding and represses scaH transcription by an unknown mechanism. During early growth, LTA is highly expressed and sequesters ScaH at the cell membrane, preventing ScaH activity in the cell wall. However, LTA expression decreases during the late growth phase, leading to ScaH translocation into the cell wall. This reduction in LTA coincides with increased wall teichoic acid (WTA) expression and cleavage of the LTA synthase LtaS. In the LTA-null mutant, ScaH inactivation restored peptidoglycan crosslinking, osmoresistance, and beta-lactam resistance both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that LTA protects the cell wall by suppressing ScaH expression and activity while sequestering it during active growth. Additionally, the reciprocal expression patterns of LTA and WTA indicate an interconnected regulation of teichoic acids in S. aureus, with their roles likely depending on the growth phase.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Knowledge regarding the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of EV-D68 within the respiratory tract and central nervous system remains limited, primarily due to an incomplete understanding of the host factors that facilitate EV-D68 entry into host cells. Several cellular receptors involved in EV-D68 infections have been identified, including ICAM-5, sialylated glycoproteins, and heparan sulfate (HS). Here, we investigate the receptor requirement of a panel of EV-D68 strains covering all clades focusing on HS and sialosides utilizing glycan arrays. We found that all EV-D68 strains binding to HS harbour a cell culture adaptative substitution in the structural protein VP1 at position 271 which changes the amino acid into a positive charged one. Glycan array analyses revealed that EV-D68 strains either prefer 2,6-linked sialic acids presented on N-glycans, 2,8 linked sialic acids on gangliosides, or both. Inhibition of glycolipid biosynthesis or multivalent glycolipid mimics confirmed that ganglioside structures serve as entry receptors for certain EV-D68 strains. Lastly, we examined whether EV-D68 strains that bind to HS or glycolipids require different uncoating mechanisms. Bafilomycin A1 minimally affected cell entry of HS-binding EV-D68 strains B2/039 and B2/947 and the ganglioside preferring B1/2013 other viruses were strongly inhibited. Together, we identified that EV-D68 strains can use disialoglycolipids as novel receptors and that different EV-D68 strains show a promiscuous sialic acid binding repertoire.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Agonists which bind and stimulate multiple receptors have shown particular promise. However, off target effects, including nausea and diarrhoea, remain a complication of using these agents, and modified versions with optimized pharmacological profiles and/or biased signaling at the cognate receptors are increasingly sought. Here, we describe the synthesis and properties of a molecule which binds to both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors (GLP-1R and GIPR) to enhance insulin secretion. HISHS-2001 shows increased affinity at the GLP-1R, as well as a tendency towards reduced internalization and recycling at this receptor versus FDA-approved dual GLP-1R/GIPR agonist tirzepatide. HISHS-2001 also displayed significantly greater bias towards cAMP generation versus {beta}-arrestin 2 recruitment compared to tirzepatide. In contrast, Gs recruitment was lower versus tirzepatide at the GLP-1R, but higher at the GIPR. Administered to obese hyperglycaemic db/db mice, HISHS-2001 increased circulating insulin whilst lowering body weight and HbA1c with similar efficacy to tirzepatide at substantially lower doses. Thus, HISHS-2001 represents a novel dual receptor agonist with an improved pharmacological profile.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Humans employ diverse strategies to support spatial memory, including the use of cognitive maps. Cognitive maps are mental representations of the environment that organize its content along two or more continuous dimensions. In allocentric cognitive maps, these dimensions form a Cartesian coordinate system referenced to the environment. In egocentric cognitive maps, the dimensions form a polar coordinate system centered on the subject. To better understand how humans employ allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps for spatial memory, we performed a behavioral study with a novel task designed to directly and explicitly assess both types of cognitive maps. During encoding periods, participants navigated through a virtual environment and encountered objects at different locations. During recall periods, participants aimed at remembering these locations in abstract allocentric and egocentric coordinate systems. Our results show that relationships between the objects and the environment, such as their distance to boundaries and corners, were associated with allocentric memory performance. Relationships between the objects and the participant, including their distance and orientation to the participant's starting position, were linked to egocentric memory performance. Spatial feedback during recall supported performance within allocentric and egocentric domains, but not across domains. These findings are compatible with the notion that allocentric and egocentric cognitive maps operate as (partially) independent systems for spatial memory, each specialized in processing specific types of spatial relationships.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Here we match 1,817 sequenced high-quality genomes from the NCTC collection to their respective year of isolation to study resistance genes before and concurrent with the age of antibiotics. Concordant with previous work, we find resistance genes in both pathogens and environmental samples before the age of antibiotics. While generally rare before the introduction of an antibiotic, we find an associated increase in frequency with antibiotic introduction. Finally, we observe a trend of resistance elements becoming both increasingly mobile and nested within multiple mobile elements as time goes on. More broadly, our findings suggest that likely-functional antibiotic resistance genes were circulating in clinically relevant isolates before the age of antibiotics, but human usage is associated with increasing both their overall prevalence and mobility.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Using an openly available dataset of over 1800 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii tomograms as a test case, we demonstrate the segmentation of 25 different subcellular features across the full dataset, while requiring only a few seconds of processing time per tomogram. We show how the approach enables the representation of large datasets as searchable databases and propose the usage of ontology-based segmentations for improving two common processing tasks in cryoET. First, we explore context-aware particle picking as a method to retain biological context when selecting particles for subtomogram averaging and other downstream analyses. Secondly, we demonstrate area-selective template matching, where we use segmentation-based masks to avoid redundant computations in template matching and enable >500-fold faster processing in specific cases.

Tolerance to mild replication stress (RS) relies on active fork slowing, mediated by transient fork reversal and RECQ1-assisted restart, and modulated by PARP1 and nuclear architectural components via yet-elusive mechanisms. We combined acute protein inactivation with cell biology and single-molecule approaches to investigate the role of Lamin A/C upon mild RS. We found that Lamin A/C dynamically interacts with replication factories throughout the nucleus and, together with its nucleoplasmic partner LAP2alpha;, is required to induce active fork slowing and maintain chromosome stability upon mild genotoxic treatments. Inactivating nucleoplasmic Lamin A/C reduces poly-ADP-ribosylation (PAR) levels at nascent DNA, triggering deregulated RECQ1-mediated restart of reversed forks. Moreover, we found that the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3, previously reported at stalled forks, also accumulates in response to mild RS. H3K9me3 accumulation requires Lamin A/C, which prevents its premature removal by the histone demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A. H3K9me3 loss per se phenocopies Lamin A/C inactivation, reducing PAR levels and deregulating RECQ1 activity at forks. Hence, nucleoplasmic Lamin A/C, H3K9me3 and PARylation levels are crucial, mechanistically-linked modulators of fork slowing, remodelling and restart upon mild RS, with important implications for chemotherapy response and Lamin A/C deregulation in human disease.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1737324482997

Methods: Results from 1233 participants (504 males and 729 females) in a retrospective analysis were included. Maximal voluntary isometric contraction strength (MVC), one-repetition maximum strength (1RM), biceps cross-sectional area (CSA) and elbow flexor volume (VOL) measures of the non-dominant and dominant arm were evaluated from baseline and after 12-wk RT twice per week. Correlations of MVC and VOL and 1RM and VOL were calculated in the whole cohort and within each sex independently. Causal analysis modeling was used to infer mechanistic relationships among variables. Results: Absolute muscle strength and size related to one another both at baseline and following training, however correlation strength in each sex were weak. After RT, MVC relative change and VOL relative change correlations were correlated for the whole cohort (r=0.16; p<0.001) and females (r=0.18; p<0.001), but not in males (r=0.11; p=0.07). No significant correlations for relative change in 1RM and VOL were observed for the whole cohort or within sex. Causal discovery determined that change in VOL caused significant change in 1RM (but not MVC) and age was identified as a potential cause. Conclusions: Sex differences occur in muscle size and strength relationship adaptations following resistance training, most notably the absence of significant relationships between relative size and strength changes in men. Simpson's paradox bias, where assessing the combined data of males and females (also affecting overall sample size) affects identifies patterns differently than assessing relationships within each sex, may partially explain our findings.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Here we considered models for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a cancer that has dramatically increased in incidence over the past few decades in Western populations, with high case fatality rates due to late-stage diagnoses. Despite advancements in genomic analyses of the precursor Barrett's esophagus (BE), prevention of late-stage EAC remains a significant clinical challenge. Previous microbiome studies in BE and EAC have focused on quantifying static microbial abundance differences rather than evolutionary dynamics. Using whole genome sequencing data from esophageal tissues, we first applied a robust bioinformatics pipeline to extract non-host DNA reads, mapped these putative reads to microbial taxa, and retained those taxa with high genomic coverage. When applying mathematical models of microbial evolution to sequential stages of progression to EAC, we observed evidence of neutral dynamics in community assembly within normal esophageal tissue and BE, but not EAC. In a case-control study of BE patients who progressed to EAC cancer outcomes (CO) versus those who had non-cancer outcomes (NCO) during follow-up (mean=10.5 years), we found that Helicobacter pylori deviated significantly from the neutral expectation in BE NCO, suggesting that factors related to H. pylori or H. pylori infection itself may influence EAC risk. Additionally, simulations incorporating selection recapitulated non-neutral behaviors observed in the datasets. Formally modeling dynamics during progression holds promise in clinical applications by offering a deeper understanding of microbial involvement in cancer development.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

These missions will generate large volumes of data too large and expensive to send back to Earth, some of which may be subject to privacy protections. To support Earth-independent scientific and medical operations, such missions can leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to build models to assist with science experiments, crew healthcare, resource management, spacecraft maintenance, scheduling, and other critical tasks. However, transmitting large volumes of data between Earth and space for model development consumes valuable bandwidth, is vulnerable to communication disruptions, and may compromise crew safety and data privacy. Federated learning provides a solution by enabling model training without transferring large, potentially privacy-sensitive datasets between Earth and space. In this work, we present a foundational architecture that facilitates the secure transmission of model updates between Earth and the International Space Station. This architecture represents the first federated learning framework deployed in a spaceflight setting, enabling classifier models to be trained and updated between Earth and the ISS using both real biomedical research data and synthetically generated data.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Here, we identify persistent, cell type-specific alternative splicing changes in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) induced by a single dose of psychedelics. Combining deep RiboTag sequencing and bioinformatics, we find that a single dose of psychedelics modestly alters gene expression while dramatically shifting patterns of alternative splicing lasting at least a month.

We studied this paradox in the Drosophila olfactory system by establishing a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of all developing antennal sensory lineages, including latent neural populations that normally undergo programmed cell death (PCD). This atlas reveals that transcriptional control is robust, but imperfect, in defining selective sensory receptor expression. A second layer of precision is afforded by the intersection of expression of functionally-interacting receptor subunits. A third layer is defined by stereotyped PCD patterning, which masks promiscuous receptor expression in neurons fated to die and removes ""empty"" neurons lacking receptors. Like receptor choice, PCD is under lineage-specific transcriptional control; promiscuity in this regulation leads to previously-unappreciated heterogeneity in neuronal numbers. Thus functional precision in the mature olfactory system belies developmental noise that might facilitate the evolution of sensory pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

These stress-activated neurons specifically respond to stress, and its activation robustly increases the anxiety-like behavior of mice without significantly influencing fear memory.

Several laboratories around the world can now generate single-cell transcriptomic data from different tissues. Unsupervised clustering, followed by annotation of the cell type of the identified clusters, is a crucial step in single-cell analyses. However, there is no consensus on the marker genes to use for annotation, and celltype annotation is currently mostly done by manual inspection of marker genes, which is irreproducible, and poorly scalable. Additionally, patient-privacy is also a critical issue with human datasets. There is a critical need to standardize and automate celltype annotation across datasets in a privacy-preserving manner. Here, we developed SwarmMAP that uses Swarm Learning to train machine learning models for cell-type classification based on single-cell sequencing data in a decentralized way. SwarmMAP does not require any exchange of raw data between data centers. SwarmMAP has a F1-score of 0.93, 0.98, and 0.88 for cell type classification in human heart, lung, and breast datasets, respectively. Swarm Learning-based models yield an average performance of 0.907 which is on par with the performance achieved by models trained on centralized data (p-val=0.937, Mann-Whitney U Test). We also find that increasing the number of datasets increases cell-type prediction accuracy and enables handling higher cell-type diversity.

Epigenomic modulation of these cells offers a strategy to reprogram pathogenic pathways without altering the genome, potentially restoring immune balance. Epigenetic inhibitors are already utilized in oncology but often exhibit adverse effects due to lack of selectivity and cytotoxic concentrations. Applying these drugs to treat autoimmune diseases necessitates more selective inhibitors and the use of tolerable concentrations. In this study, we screened a library of 25 compounds with varying degrees of target selectivity and different concentrations. Spectral cytometry enabled the analysis of cell-subset distribution and activation, followed by bulk RNA-sequencing for transcriptomic profiling. We could demonstrate cell-subset specific and concentration-dependent immune modulation in PBMCs. Transcriptomic analysis showed that inhibitors of histone acetylation-modulating enzymes significantly altered gene expression, particularly in immune regulation pathways relevant to autoimmune diseases. Comparative analysis between in-vitro treated healthy controls and RA patients demonstrated both shared and selective drug effects, with some inhibitors like Ricolinostat overlapping with established RA drug pathways. Our findings highlight the potential of epigenetic inhibitors, especially those targeting histone acetylation, to modulate immune responses in a target-selective manner.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Yet, studies of microbial population differentiation across environmental gradients have been surprisingly scarce. In this study, we tested for phenotypic and genetic divergence in rhizobia bacteria (genus Sinorhizobium) associated with the legume Medicago lupulina across two environmental gradients: an elevation gradient in the Appalachian Mountains and an urbanization gradient in Philadelphia. Common garden experiments in Medicago sativa revealed that symbiotic traits differed significantly between high- and low-elevation rhizobia populations, but not between urban and suburban populations. Nitrogen supplementation erased the trait differences between low- and high-elevation populations, consistent with the hypothesis that these differences arise from the nitrogen that rhizobia provide. In contrast to symbiotic traits, free-living growth traits showed minimal differentiation across gradients. To test the hypothesis that greater gene flow constrains phenotypic divergence in the urbanization gradient, we compared the strength of isolation by distance in the core and accessory genomes across the two gradients. Contrary to our expectation, isolation by distance was significantly stronger in the urbanization gradient in both the core and accessory genomes. These results suggest that our focal elevation gradient imposed stronger divergent selection on rhizobia than our focal urbanization gradient. Together, this study highlights the need for a holistic understanding of microbial evolution with regard to the traits across life stages, molecular evolution across genomic levels, and evolutionary processes across environmental gradients.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

LDAK-PBAT tests pathways for significance using a heritability-based framework that controls for both the contributions of genes not in the pathway and of inter-genic SNPs.

LDAK-PBAT is computationally efficient, requiring only GWAS summary statistics and a reference panel, and when applied to human traits, can test 1000s of pathways within minutes. When assessed using simulated phenotypes, we find that LDAK-PBAT is well calibrated and has high sensitivity and specificity, outperforming both MAGMA and hypergeometric testing (F1 score of 0.734, versus 0.636 and 0.570, respectively).

When used to test 6,000 pathways for each of 37 traits (obtained from the UK Biobank, Millions Veterans Program and psychiatric genomics consortium; sample sizes ranging from 17,014 to 1,114,458), LDAK-PBAT identified 4,861 significant pathways (P < 0.05/6000), which is substantially more than found by MAGMA (97) and hypergeometric testing (522).

Consequently, the influence of chrX to human complex traits remains debated. Here, we systematically assessed the relevance of chrX and the effect of its biology on complex traits by analyzing 48 quantitative traits in 343,695 individuals in UK Biobank with replication in 412,181 individuals from FinnGen. We show that, in the general population, chrX contributes to complex trait heritability at a rate of 3% of the autosomal heritability, consistent with the amount of genetic variation observed in chrX. We find that a pronounced male-bias in chrX heritability supports the presence of near-complete dosage compensation between sexes through X chromosome inactivation (XCI). However, we also find subtle yet plausible evidence of escape from XCI contributing to human height. Assuming full XCI, the observed chrX contribution to complex trait heritability in both sexes is greater than expected given presence of only a single active copy of chrX, mirroring potential dosage compensation between chrX and the autosomes. We find this enhanced contribution attributable to systematically larger active allele effects from chrX compared to autosomes in both sexes, independent of allele frequency and variant deleteriousness. Together these findings support a model where the two dosage compensation mechanisms work in concert to balance the influence of the chrX across the population while preserving sex-specific differences at a manageable level. Overall, our study advocates for more comprehensive locus discovery efforts in chrX.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Melbournevirus encodes a distinct H2B-H2A histone doublet variant in addition to the canonical H4-H3 and H2B-H2A doublets. This viral histone variant has a truncated H2B portion and its amino acid sequence deviates from that of the main viral H2B-H2A throughout the entire coding region. It is less abundant than the main H2B-H2A doublet, is essential for melbournevirus fitness, and is conserved in all Marseilleviridae.

The reduced ability to bind DNA can be attributed to structural differences between variant and main H2B-H2A.

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty.

ObservationsWe aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted (1 death averted per 5,400 vaccine doses administered). Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (1 life-year saved per 900 vaccine doses administered). Sensitivity range was 7.4-23.6 million life-years. Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit.

Conclusions and relevanceBased on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still clearly demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1737324482997

In mice, reducing dietary levels of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) recapitulates many of the benefits of a low protein diet; BCAA-restricted diets extend lifespan, reduce frailty, and improve metabolic health, while BCAA supplementation shortens lifespan, promotes obesity, and impairs glycemic control. Recently, high protein diets have been shown to promote cellular senescence, a hallmark of aging implicated in many age-related diseases, in the liver of mice. Here, we test the hypothesis that the effects of high protein diets on metabolic health and on cell senescence are mediated by BCAAs. We find that reducing dietary levels of BCAAs protects male and female mice from the negative metabolic consequences of both normal and high protein diets. Further, we identify tissue-specific effects of BCAAs on cellular senescence, with restriction of all three BCAAs - but not individual BCAAs - protecting from hepatic cellular senescence while potentiating cell senescence in white adipose tissue. We find that the effects of BCAAs on hepatic cellular senescence are cell-autonomous, with lower levels of BCAAs protecting cultured cells from antimycin-A induced senescence. Our results demonstrate a direct effect of a specific dietary component on a hallmark of aging and suggest that cellular senescence may be highly susceptible to dietary interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

How this position is regulated and its role in genome photoprotection remains unknown. By developing a model of human keratinocytes internalizing extracellular melanin into pigment organelles, we show that keratin 5/14 intermediate filaments mechanically control the 3D perinuclear position of pigments, shielding DNA from photodamage. Imaging and microrheology in human disease-related model identify structural keratin cages surrounding pigment organelles to stiffen their microenvironment and maintain their 3D position. Optimum pigment spatialization is required for DNA photoprotection and rely on the interplay between intermediate filaments and microtubules bridged by plectin cytolinkers. Thus, the mechanically-driven proximity of pigment organelles to the nucleus is a key photoprotective parameter. Uncovering how human skin counteracts solar radiation by positioning the melanin microparasol next to the genome anticipates that dynamic spatialization of organelles is a physiological UV stress response.

Short summaryMelanin pigments shield DNA from photodamage by positioning atop nuclei in skin keratinocytes. We show keratin 5/14 intermediate filaments control this 3D spatialization, forming protective cages around pigments. This positioning, together with microtubule function, optimizes genome protection, revealing cytoskeletons and organelle dynamics as a UV stress response.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Moreover, spill over of H5N1 HPAIV from infected birds to more than 50 different mammalian species including humans has been recorded. While, licensed vaccines for protection of avian or mammalian species are not yet available, a few candidate vaccines are being trialled. Here, we report on the experimental vaccination of chickens and captive wild birds using a propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the essential envelope glycoprotein (G) protein gene was replaced by a modified hemagglutinin gene derived from a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 isolated in 2022 in the animal park of Bern, Switzerland. VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) was produced on helper cells providing the VSV G protein in trans. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens that were immunized twice via the intramuscular route with adjuvant-free VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) replicon particles induced high levels of virus-neutralizing serum antibodies and were fully protected against lethal infection by H5N1 HPAIV (clade 2.3.4.4b). Notably, immunized animals did not shed challenge virus from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that herd immunity can be achieved. The same vaccine was used to immunize a total of 317 captive wild birds at Bern Animal Park and Zoo Basel, representing 24 different species. No vaccine-associated side effects were observed. Birds without previous contact to H5Nx viruses produced high to very high H5-specific neutralizing antibody titers following the second immunization, while birds showing H5-specific antibodies prior to vaccination, already developed high neutralising antibody titers after a single immunization. One year after vaccination, most animals still showed significant neutralizing antibody titers, indicating that VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) is able to induce a long-lasting protective immune response. Our results indicate that VSV{Delta}G(H5mb) is an extraordinary safe and highly efficacious vaccine to stop H5N1 replication in various avian species.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

Upregulated intestinal proteolysis and PAR2-signaling are implicated in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). To identify potential bacterial regulators of PAR2 activity, we developed a functional assay for PAR2 processing and used it to screen conditioned media from a library of diverse gut commensal microbes. We found that multiple bacteria secrete proteases that cleave host PAR2. Using chemoproteomic profiling with a covalent irreversible inhibitor, we identified a previously uncharacterized Bacteroides fragilis serine protease Bfp1, and showed that it cleaves and activates PAR2 in multicellular and murine models. PAR2 cleavage by Bfp1 disrupts the intestinal barrier, sensitizes nociceptors, and triggers colonic inflammation and abdominal pain. Collectively, our findings uncover Bfp1-mediated PAR2-processing as a new axis of host-commensal-interaction in the gut that has the potential to be targeted for therapeutic intervention in IBD or IBS.","NA","biorxiv",1737324482997

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1737324482997

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1737324482997
