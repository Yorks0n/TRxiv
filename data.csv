MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 33 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time- dependent covariate) was evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, including adjusting for influenza activity as an effect modifier.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43920 (82.2%) were vaccinated by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1130 (2.12%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over time the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of influenza was not significantly different during periods when influenza activity was low (HR, .70; 95% C.I., .42 - 1.15; P = .15) or medium (HR, 1.20; 95% C.I., .86 - 1.67; P = .28), but was significantly higher for the vaccinated state than the unvaccinated state when influenza activity was high (HR, 1.33; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.64; P = .009).

ConclusionsThis study was unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination among working-aged adults during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found that influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of influenza when influenza activity was high.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find a protective influence of influenza vaccination during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season and found a significantly higher risk of influenza with vaccination when influenza activity was high.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761430130560

Here, we present Icecream, which follows the broad template of earlier self-supervised approaches, but treats symmetry in a way consistent with the recent equivariant imaging framework (Chen et al., 2021). Coupled with several engineering refinements, including mixed-precision arithmetic, Icecream achieves substantially better denoising and more reliable missing-wedge recovery, while reducing training and inference time relative to comparable baselines. Across diverse experimental datasets, we observe consistent gains in reconstruction quality, both visually and as quantified by Fourier shell correlation (FSC). Our framework extends to any tomography problem that provides two statistically independent reconstructions of the same volume; in cryo-ET these are obtained by dose splitting or angular partitioning of the tilt series.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""852821;""},{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministère de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we here identified the bridge-like lipid transport protein VPS13C/PARK23 as a key component of a global early response pathway to lysosome damage. VPS13C readily binds lysosomes under mechanical or osmotic tension in anticipation of membrane lesions. The latter trigger a conformational change in the protein's C-terminus, involving its ATG2C domain acting as sensor of damage-induced lipid packing defects. We show that ER-lysosome contacts formed by VPS13C provide critical binding platforms for OSBP/ORPs to enable efficient ER wrapping of damaged lysosomes. A chemical approach to assess directional ER-to-lysosome lipid transport revealed that VPS13C is essential for large-scale lipid delivery to acutely damaged lysosomes to facilitate their repair. Our findings offer new mechanistic insights into how loss-of-function mutations in VPS13C may enhance the risk of Parkinson's disease.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""512783018;467522186/SFB1557–P9;467522186/SFB1557–P6;467522186/SFB1557–Z1;467522186/SFB1557–Z2;""},{""name"":""Novo Nordisk Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04txyc737"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NNF17OC0029432;""},{""name"":""German Academic Exchange Service"",""id"":""https://ror.org/039djdh30"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""57552340;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Here, we show how HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3) specifically recognizes the folded, disulfide-stabilized CTNIP/SCREW phytocytokines in Arabidopsis. Quantitative binding assays define a minimal CTNIP4 region required for high-affinity HSL3 interaction and signaling activation. A 2.12 [A] crystal structure of the HSL3-CTNIP4 complex reveals a unique C-terminal receptor pocket that accommodates the cyclic architecture of the peptide through a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts, a feature absent in the closely related HAE/HSL LRR-RKs. The cyclic CTNIP4 fold further establishes a largely hydrophobic interface that bridges HSL3 to the SERK co-receptor, forming a distinct activation surface. Together, these structural, biochemical and physiological insights uncover a previously unrecognised mechanism of peptide perception and receptor activation, highlighting how subtle architectural variations enable precise ligand selectivity among highly conserved plant receptor kinases.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_204526;10001549;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1061-2023;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""773153;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Understanding how gut microbes interact and contribute to plastic degradation is essential for developing potential microbiome-based bioremediation strategies. We isolated 184 microbes from wild Alaskan threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) guts across six lakes and screened for plastic degrading potential using lipase/esterase assays and biofilm formation on PET and PP. During the screen for microbes with plastic degrading potential, we discovered that stickleback gut microbiota members enhance and suppressed the lipase, esterase, and biofilm activity of other microbes. Isolates with the highest plastic degrading potential were incubated in minimal media with PET or PP as the sole carbon source to determine whether plastic degradation potential is enhanced. Surface analysis identified a Pseudomonas trivialis strain that exhibited degradation of PP in monoculture; however, this activity was suppressed in the presence of another gut isolate, Pseudomonas germanica. These results demonstrate that microbes associated with the wild threespine stickleback gut microbiome possess plastic degradation potential and provide insights into how microbial interactions can either promote or inhibit bioremediation of plastic pollution in cold-water environments.","[{""name"":""Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (United States)"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02qenvm24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-253562-5022;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R15GM122038;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1126100;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Differential serotoninergic modulation of specific aversive and rewarding dopaminergic neuron subtypes permits post-ingestive intoxication to suppress consolidation of initial odor-sugar memory and simultaneously invert reward memory plasticity into ""safety"" memory for the odor experienced without food. Fat body release of the Toll-ligand activating protease modSP, and resilience factor Turandot A, instruct malaise updates by triggering autocrine Toll signaling in the same brain dopaminergic neurons that form and consolidate initial sugar memory.

All previously characterized retrons produce high levels of multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) in the cell by reverse transcription, which acts as an antitoxin in the absence of phage infection. However, we describe here a non-canonical mechanism for Type VI retrons, which do not produce detectable msDNA in the absence of phage, yet still provide phage defense. Focusing primarily on Retron-Vpa2, a Type VI retron from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we show broad defense against phages and identify triggers of the system within phage recombination systems. Within the Retron-Vpa2 operon, we find a highly enriched, structured transcript that we term a hybrid RNA (hyRNA), which contains both the retrons reverse transcription template and a translationally repressed toxic effector coding sequence. We find that phage infection induces the accumulation of high levels of msDNA and that this msDNA is necessary for derepressing translation of the antiviral toxin. These findings present key biological and mechanistic insights into a distinct group of retrons while highlighting the diversity of systems that participate in bacterial immunity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

HLA-B*07:02+ individuals living with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS) were characterized by a relative reduction in EBNA6-specific and MAG-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors. Furthermore, both RRMS and PMS patients exhibited a delayed expansion of CMV- and laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors indicating an age-specific interaction with disease. Female RRMS patients were moreover characterized by a specific reduction of laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to male RRMS patients. NAg-specific CD8 T cells recognized heterogeneous peptides, were of low cellular frequency in peripheral blood, and exhibited a circulating, naive-like, anergic phenotype. In contrast, virus-specific CD8 T cells were characterized by high-frequency cellular responses with an effector-like, tissue-homing phenotype. These immunophenotypes were largely shared between MS and healthy donors. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into CD8 T-cell recognition of both NAg and laEBV antigens in MS and constitute a key reference map of epitopes for further immunomonitoring of EBV- and self-specific CD8 T cells in health and disease.","[{""name"":""The Lundbeck Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R190-2014-4178;""},{""name"":""European Research Council ERC Consolidator"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MIMIC 101045517;""},{""name"":""Scleroseforeningen"",""id"":""https://ror.org/037s01565"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""A44005;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

These artifacts can affect demultiplexing accuracy and downstream analyses. Results We performed a rapid barcoding experiment on 66 diagnostic samples and found that 83% of reads carried the expected single-barcode pattern, while 17% contained multiple barcodes or other artifacts. Current demultiplexers, including the widely used Dorado, fail to correctly handle these complex cases, leaving approximately 7% of reads partially trimmed and contaminated with adapter fragments. Additional issues include the presence of two barcodes at the same read end - either identical, originating from the same sample, or different, introduced after pooling. The latter can lead to barcode bleeding when the outer barcode is incorrectly selected. To address these challenges, we developed Barbell, a pattern-aware demultiplexer that detects all barcode configurations. Barbell reduces trimming errors by three orders of magnitude, minimizes barcode bleeding, and supports custom experimental setups such as shorter barcodes, dual-end barcodes, and custom flank sequences.

Exudate profiles and total dissolved organic carbon exudation rates were consistent across different sampling approaches, whereas root biomass, root morphology measurements, and organic nitrogen exudation varied. High-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of phylogenetic markers and nitrogen cycle-selected genes revealed a protocol-specific footprint in the composition and abundance of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiota. Yet, on average, 75% of microbes enriched in, and differentiating between, barley rhizosphere and unplanted soil controls were recovered across all the sampling approaches evaluated.

Centromere kinetochore domains emerged as focal sites of structural, genetic, and epigenetic variation, leading to remodeling of centromere kinetochore binding domains during tumor evolution. Single-molecule telomere reconstructions uncovered cycles of attrition, deletion, and telomerase-mediated extension that shape cancer telomeres. Finally, diploid chromatin maps exposed that copy number alterations and epimutations, rather than point mutations, predominate in rewiring cancer regulatory programs. These findings define the full landscape of a cancers somatic variation and their functional impact, establishing a blueprint for T2T studies of mosaicism.","[{""name"":""Office of the Director"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00fj8a872"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UM1DA058220;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1DP5OD029630;1U01HG013744;""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1K99GM155552;T32GM141828;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

While traditionally thought to consist of a uniform set of proteins, here we discover that ribosome composition is reprogrammed to adapt to intrinsic and external cellular perturbations. During infection by non-segmented negative-sense viruses, viral entry into cells recruits the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 to a noncanonical site on the small subunit of 80S ribosomes near the mRNA entry site. These specialized ribosomes preferentially bind viral mRNAs to drive enhanced viral protein synthesis that is critical for replication under host pressures. Unexpectedly, we find that viruses have co-opted this translation pathway from a previously unrecognized endogenous ribosome remodeling program in which metabolic stress alters ribosome structure to promote mRNA translation required for cell survival. Thus, ribosome remodeling is a conserved mechanism enabling dynamic protein synthesis across pathogen and cellular adaptation.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1S10OD036228-01;GM067945;GM007122;1R35GM142527;""},{""name"":""Pew Charitable Trusts"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02xhk2825"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""G.

Nevertheless, experimental studies and network simulations suggest that interneuron subclasses such as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) exert distinct control over oscillatory dynamics. Yet, we lack a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying oscillations in E-PV-SOM circuits and of the differences with respect to the classical mechanisms for oscillations in simpler E-I networks. Here, we derive a biologically realistic mean-field model of a canonical three-population E-PV-SOM circuit. This model robustly generates oscillations whose features are consistent with experimental observations, including the relative timing of PV and SOM activity and the effects of optogenetic perturbations. By reducing the model to a linear analytical form, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations emerge directly from the cell-specific connectivity of the three-population circuit. This connectivity motif alone accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships, with PV activity consistently leading that of SOM neurons. Together, this mean field model identifies a distinct structural mechanism giving rise to oscillations in canonical E-PV-SOM circuits and provides theoretical primitives for constructing large-scale, cell-type-specific models of cortical dynamics.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

It is an exemplar condition for evaluating penetrance in adult cohorts due to its relatively low mortality, variable expressivity and link to several large genes. Using genome sequencing data from [~]500,000 adults in UK Biobank, we curated a set of rare pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in COL1A1, COL1A2 and IFITM5 using annotations from gnomAD, ClinVar and SpliceAI. Analysis of summed read-count data from genome and exome sequencing led to exclusion of 16 mosaic variants with consistently low allelic balance of 3.4-35.9%. We identified 61 likely constitutive heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL1A1 and COL1A2 (29 loss-of-function or splice variants and 32 missense) in 115 participants, with a mean age at recruitment of 55.1 years; no pathogenic variants were identified in IFITM5. Phenotypes were assessed using ICD-10 codes, self-reports and heel bone mineral density. Overall disease penetrance was lower than anticipated: 40.7% for COL1A1 and 21.3% for COL1A2, potentially due to depletion of severe early-onset disease. When considering only truncating variants in COL1A1, disease penetrance increased to 73.1%, and 90% of individuals had reduced levels of circulating COL1A1 protein. For COL1A2, bone mineral density data supported the low penetrance, whereas for COL1A1, data suggested the possibility of a subclinical phenotype. Overall, for pathogenic missense variants (including those altering Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats), the low penetrance observed suggests reliance on current ClinVar assertions to support pathogenicity may overstate OI risk in population screening.","NA","NA","medRxiv",1761430130561

The new probes provide robust organelle targeting, except for the mitochondrial probe, whose targeting ability is cell type dependent. Due to operating range of Prodan fluorophore in the UV-Blue region, our probes can be easily combined with other fluorescent tags in the visible range. Therefore, polarity of sub-cellular compartments can be studied together with additional fluorescent reporters. We used these probes to show the polarity of organelle membranes in healthy cells and under starvation condition where we observed organelle-specific polarity remodeling.

However, the causal relationship between HR and effective immunity remains unresolved. We show that the Arabidopsis cbp60g sard1 double mutant exhibits exaggerated ETI-associated HR but only partial resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens, thereby genetically uncoupling cell death from disease resistance without pleiotropic defects. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling reveals that the absence of CBP60g and SARD1 disrupts the balance between immune activators and suppressors, including reduced induction of the Nudix hydrolase NUDT7. Overexpression of NUDT7 diminishes but does not abolish the heightened HR phenotype in cbp60g sard1 mutant, indicating that multiple negative regulators act redundantly to restrain immune-associated cell death. These findings demonstrate that HR is not an obligatory determinant of effective resistance and provide mechanistic insight into how plants coordinate transcriptional networks to balance pathogen defence with the containment of host cell death. By refining the relationship between HR and immunity, this work challenges a long-standing paradigm in plant biology and advances our understanding of immune regulation.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101039824;""},{""name"":""Gatsby Charitable Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0290hax27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

We previously identified a 55-bp cis-repressive element in the PKD1 3'UTR. Here, we define a six-nucleotide miR-17 seed match within this element that is sufficient to reproduce PKD1 repression. In vivo base substitution of this motif stabilizes Pkd1 mRNA and increases polycystin-1 (PC1) protein levels, producing a robust reduction in cyst growth and preservation of kidney function in mouse models. To therapeutically recapitulate this effect, we developed a steric-blocking oligonucleotide that occludes the motif, stabilizes PKD1 transcript levels, increases PC1 expression, and mitigates cyst-pathogenic events in both murine and patient-derived ADPKD cells. Together, these findings establish a minimal, targetable cis-regulatory motif and provide proof-of-concept for oligonucleotide-mediated PKD1 derepression, while offering a potentially generalizable strategy to restore other haploinsufficient genes.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""5R01DK102572;5R01DK133186;1R01DK139033;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

We find that only a subset of full promoters is activated by distal neuronal enhancers and that the promoter-proximal region is necessary for this enhancer-promoter compatibility. Core promoters alone are insufficient to respond to distal enhancers but modulate the transcriptional output of responsive promoters.

Meanwhile, we identified two classes of transcription factors recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to epigenetically silence STM. The balance between these forces establishes a cell cycle-coupled epigenetic ""Sisyphus"" mechanism that maintains pluripotency.

Here, we show that a computational method designed for multi-omic analysis in eukaryotes can be leveraged to integrate and analyse five layers of holo-omic data from porcine hosts and their gut microbiomes. We collected caecal tissue and digesta samples during a feeding trial that tested the impact of microbiota-directed fibres (acetylated galactoglucomannan) at critical developmental stages. From 800,000 features including microbial and host genes, metagenome-assembled genomes, and metabolites from caecal tissue and digesta, we used multiset correlation and factor analysis to select the most relevant features for capturing coordinated patterns across omic layers. From these features, we predicted over 2,000 putative host-microbiome interactions based on co-occurrence. Some of them reflected previously known relationships between animal and microbiome features, such as microbial genes for carbohydrate metabolism being linked to glycoside abundances in host tissue. Other predicted co-occurrences included features that were not detected in single-omic analysis and offer new hypotheses of host-microbiome interactions that warrant future investigation. Hence, we showcase an application of holo-omic analysis that avoids common pitfalls in high-dimensional data analysis; identifies known interactions as a form of validation; and most importantly, predicts new leads for understanding host-microbiome symbiosis.

ImportanceWhile study systems involving mammalian hosts and their microbiomes are inherently complex, multi- and holo-omic analyses promise to provide interpretable results with translational value for the animal production industry. Unfortunately, computational methods capable of this kind of integration are currently scarce, as most existing multi-omics approaches have been developed for analysis of data layers within a single multicellular organism. We propose to adapt existing multi-omic methods for holo-omics by combining feature selection and interaction inference. This two-step analysis approach addresses common challenges in data-driven studies and can be implemented with a variety of tools for feature selection and interaction modelling. Through this holistic approach, we show that both known and novel relationships across the holobiont axis can be identified in a data-driven manner, offering new targets for the continued study of host-microbiome interactions and the effect of dietary interventions on production animals.","[{""name"":""European Union"",""id"":""https://ror.org/019w4f821"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101000309;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Existing foundation models for single-cell analysis typically embed cells as continuous vectors, limiting their generative flexibility and hindering integration with the knowledge accumulated in large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present CellTok, a multimodal LLM framework for unified analysis of scRNA-seq data and biological text. Each cell is tokenized into discrete codebook tokens via VQ-VAE and integrated into the LLM's vocabulary using early fusion. This allows CellTok to process biological and textual inputs autoregressively, leveraging pretrained knowledge within LLMs to analyze cellular states and interactions. CellTok demonstrates strong performance in cell-level tasks such as annotation and generation, and enables previously unattainable large population-level tasks, including accurate prediction of intercellular communication networks, which is a key mechanism in tissue organization and disease. Furthermore, it retains interactive Q&A capabilities grounded in biomedical knowledge, offering a new paradigm for analyzing complex cellular systems. Our results suggest that the CellTok framework can extend the capabilities of LLMs to single-cell data, and suggests a direction for building more general mixed-modal models.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Experiments, with their ability to control variables and isolate mechanisms, are a powerful tool for uncovering the causal processes that drive community dynamics. They therefore allow us to move beyond correlations and to directly test theoretical predictions. Yet, because experiments are often logistically demanding and resource-intensive, they are less frequently employed than observational approaches in community ecology. Here, we trace the past three decades of experimental research in community ecology through a systematic literature review. We focus on the motivation behind experiments, their links to ecological theory, the types of questions they address, their scale, and the methods used to do this. Our results corroborate the historically tight relationship between experiments and ecological theory and document a gradual increase in experimental complexity -particularly related to the use of molecular methods. However, persistent gaps remain in the taxa and ecosystems studied, with aquatic ecosystems, fungi, and microbes still underrepresented compared to terrestrial plants and animals. Moreover, experiments are still limited in their spatial and temporal scale; they are typically short-term, local, and reliant on manual methods. The integration of high-throughput technologies with experimental workflows is still in its infancy, even though they are increasingly common in biomonitoring. To illustrate the potential of such tools in experimental research, we present a proof-of-concept study. It shows how automated technologies can be incorporated at different stages of the experimental workflow to expand the scale of experiments while reducing the reliance on human labor and potentially lowering financial costs. We conclude that many of the long-lasting biases and challenges in experimental community ecology could be addressed by combining technological innovations with broader collaboration among research groups. Coordinated networks, standardized protocols, and the integration of long-term and large-scale experimental designs can substantially improve in situ replication as well as cross-site comparability. Such efforts are essential for developing a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of community dynamics across diverse ecosystems.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Research Council of Finland"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05k73zm37"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""336212;345110;342374;""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2023-05118;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

We mapped editing outcomes in human CD34 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), mouse LSK HSPC equivalents, human upper airway organoids, and mouse multi-organ in vivo editing. Profiling 500,000 alleles across 74 cell types, scOUT-seq revealed that outcomes in most cell subtypes differ markedly from the bulk average. Various cell types shifted major repair classes, preferred different molecular sequences, and even enriched large structural variants, with distinctive patterns of allelic co-occurrence.

Using tomato as a model, we tested over 800 SynCom-temperature combinations consisting of root endophytic bacteria and rhizosphere metabolites.

However, some species undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), whereby specific genome regions are removed from somatic cell lineages early during development, leading to distinct germline and somatic genomes. Since its discovery in parasitic nematodes over a century ago, PDE has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliates, arthropods, and vertebrates. However, the function, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of PDE remain poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of PDE in three early-diverging Caenorhabditis species. Using long-read and chromatin conformation capture sequencing, we reconstructed germline and somatic genomes for all three species, and found that between 0.7 and 2.3% of the genome is eliminated during the 8- to 16-cell stage of embryogenesis, including the telomeres and regions within chromosomes. Elimination of regions within chromosomes results in fragmentation of the six germline chromosomes into 8-15 somatic chromosomes. The sites of elimination are precise, and we identified conserved motifs that likely recruit a nuclease to induce double-strand breaks. The newly formed somatic chromosome ends are healed by de novo telomere addition. A small number of genes are eliminated in each species, some of which have C. elegans orthologues with essential germline functions. A subset of elimination sites are orthologous across species, and some coincide with genome rearrangement sites. The phylogenetic distribution of PDE suggests that it was present in the last common Caenorhabditis ancestor and subsequently lost early during the evolution of many species, including C. elegans.","[{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""220540/Z/20/A;""},{""name"":""Japan Science and Technology Agency"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00097mb19"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JPMJCR18S7;JPMJCR24B4;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""JP23K17400;JP24H00549;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

For such synthetic cells to accurately replicate cellular reactions, it is critical that the concentrations of encapsulated molecules mirror those in living systems, as reaction kinetics and cellular network states are highly sensitive to these concentrations. However, methods for precisely determining encapsulation efficiency in synthetic cells at single cell resolution have been limited. To address this challenge, we developed QuantGUV, a software-driven, image-based analysis method that determines the concentrations of fluorescent molecules encapsulated within giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). We used QuantGUV to measure the encapsulation efficiencies of fluorescent molecules, ranging in size from 0.5 nm to 20 nm. These measurements were conducted on GUVs formed via the water-in-oil emulsion transfer method under various experimental conditions. Using QuantGUV, we have measured the encapsulation efficiencies of three fluorescence molecules, sulforhodamine B, mEGFP and polystyrene bead, in GUVs formed via the water-in-oil emulsion transfer method. The encapsulation efficiencies for polystyrene bead was close to 100 % in most of the conditions while sulforhodamine B and mEGFP's encapsulation efficiencies depended on the parameters during the GUV formation such as concentrations of lipids and oil-water ratio during the GUV formation. By providing crucial insights into encapsulation efficiencies, QuantGUV offers a valuable tool to monitor the building quantitative synthetic cell systems with accurately controlled internal environments which is a critical step towards the creation of synthetic cells.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X023303/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00cwqg982"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/X01262X/1;""},{""name"":""Royal Society"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wnrjx87"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGSR2242552;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

We propose a Bayesian approach to the estimation of atomic scattering factors which incorporates the effect of the molecular environment while remaining fast, interpretable and transferable between molecules. Our algorithm infers atomic scattering factors directly from maps of the electrostatic potential determined by cryo-EM single particle analysis, bypassing the need for computationally-intensive theoretical calculations. The algorithm is used to infer empirical scattering factors from high-resolution reconstructions of catalase enzymes. To illustrate its broad applicability, the algorithm is also applied to a training set of publicly-available cryo-EM data. The empirical scattering factors show improved agreement with a test set of cryo-EM reconstructions. The predictions are further validated by comparison with magnetic susceptibility values of organic compounds, as well as by application to the refinement of atomic models.","[{""name"":""Medical Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03x94j517"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MC_UP_A025_1012;MC_UP_120117;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Our understanding of PDE mechanisms, including the involvement of small RNAs and transposases, is mainly based on studies in the single-cell ciliates, whereas in metazoans, the PDE mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the parasitic nematode Ascaris, PDE removes and remodels all germline chromosome ends, splits fused chromosomes into somatic chromosomes, leading to dramatic karyotype changes. To probe the possible involvement of small RNAs in Ascaris PDE, we identified two Argonautes, AsWAGO-2 and AsWAGO-3, associated with PDE. Using cellular fractionation followed by nuclease-treated immunoprecipitation, we characterized WAGO-associated small RNAs (siRNAs) and their targets in chromatin, nucleoplasm, and cytoplasm. We found that AsWAGO-3 is enriched on eliminated chromatin, with its associated siRNAs mostly targeting genes. However, a subset of AsWAGO-3 siRNAs targets repeats in the eliminated regions specifically located in the middle of chromosomes that originated from the ends of ancestral chromosomes. In contrast, AsWAGO-2 transiently stains the retained chromosomes during elimination mitoses, and the associated siRNAs are enriched in the retained regions only in the chromatin fraction. Overall, our data established a link between WAGOs and Ascaris PDE, demonstrating the flexibility of small RNA pathways that selectively distinguish retained and eliminated DNA. We suggest that some of the targeting may be a response to the karyotype changes associated with chromosome fusion and PDE.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""AI155588;GM151551;AI114054;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Whilst i) methods for the photochemical perturbation of pro-teins and ii) photophysical protein probes and sensors are both known powerful tools, simultaneous methods for site- and context-specific photochemical modification of a protein side chain with concomitant modulation of photophysical properties would allow interrogation of protein function via diverse modes (potentially reporting simultaneously on structure and dynamics of ground- and reactive- state properties). Due to their mechanistic complexity, rational approaches for the design of suitable photochemical strategies can be difficult and non-intuitive. Here, we describe a high-throughput experimentation (HTE) strategy designed to allow the photochemical modification of a genetically-encoded, minimally disruptive ('zero-size'), photophysically-active - yet typically unreac-tive and biologically-inert - unnatural amino acid (uAA) residue in proteins. The discovery of a novel dearomative, formal [4+3] photocycloaddition of imidazopyrimidine reagents which proceeds via photochemically generated carbon-centred radical intermediates with polyaromatic substrates enabled chemoselective application to the normally unreactive Trp-mimetic residue, 2-naphthylalanine (Npa). Npa's site-selective installation allows dual photo-chemical and photophysical dearomative perturbation benignly and efficiently in proteins. Replacement of Trp in the archetypal apoptotic biosensor protein Annexin A5 (AnxV) enabled dual photochemical-photophysical determination of switched, conforma-tionally-determined reactive states induced by Ca2+-binding, without any apparent functional perturbation of its in vitro or cellular recognition of phospholipids, indicating an ordered annexin mechanism. This ready and benign unification of photochemistry and photophysics suggests a general approach for using high-throughput light-mediated experimentation in artefact-free chemical biology to capture different functional states of proteins and to interrogate those states using combined photochemical-photophysical methods.","[{""name"":""UKRI-EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/V011359/1, EP/V011367/1, EP/T012021/1, EP/X527245/1, EP/W002914/1, EP/N025652/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

In the vertebrate spinal cord, progenitors are patterned into molecularly defined domains, but how lineage relationships shape neuronal diversity and function has remained unclear. Here, we combine genomic barcoding with single-cell RNA sequencing in chick and human embryos to generate cell-type-resolved clonal maps. We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception.

Furthermore, our model also featured a temporal evolution of feedback responses to perturbations that resembles experimental observations, and naturally accounted for motor decisions observed when participants select one among multiple goals in dynamic environments. Together, these developments show that in many cases, movement duration may not need to be specified a priori, but instead could result from task-dependent control policies. This framework validates a candidate explanation for varied movement durations, which invites to reconsider the nature and strength of evidence for the finite horizon formulation.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

However, existing methods either rely on computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes or adopt variational approaches that forgo principled uncertainty quantification. To address this limitation and cater to practical needs, we abandon the MCMC framework and turn to resampling-based posterior inference for multimodal integration. Our method, Bayesian Cooperative Learning (BayesCOOP), embeds fast maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation within a Bayesian bootstrap, combining a novel jittered group spike-and-slab prior with an efficient expectation-maximization (EM) coordinate descent algorithm under randomly weighted data perturbations. Averaging posterior summaries (MAP estimates) across bootstrap replicates yields approximate posterior samples that retain Bayesian interpretability while avoiding the computational burden of traditional sampling-based inference. We establish theoretical connections between BayesCOOP's pseudo-posterior averaging and posterior contraction principles, demonstrating near-optimal posterior consistency under sparsity. Extensive simulation studies and analyses of pregnancy multi-omics datasets demonstrate that BayesCOOP substantially outperforms state-of-the-art early, intermediate, and late fusion approaches in estimation, prediction, and uncertainty assessment.

These neurons are mapped onto a quantitative anatomical model of the insula based on a Nissl-staining coordinate framework. Using improved algorithms, we define 21 morphological, 12 electrical, and 9 input neuronal types, and identify several morphological and input types that are unique to the insula. Further, we find that morphological properties constrain and often predict inputs, electrical properties, or projection targets. Several morphological types are differentially distributed between the functionally distinct anterior and posterior insula, providing the substrates for a quantitative demarcation between the anterior and posterior insular subregions. Surprisingly, certain neuronal types receive intra-insular inputs originating far beyond canonical cortical columns. Functionally, these connections bridge a long-range thalamus-to-amygdalar circuit that potentially links sensory information to valence.

Conventional genetic engineering of hiPSC lines requires a laborious process involving transfection, selection and expansion that can result in karyotypic abnormalities or transgene silencing during differentiation, limiting their applications. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) delivery is a potential alternative integration-free method for durable expression of transgenes. Here, we used saRNA to deliver transcription factors and functional reporters in hiPSCs and demonstrate that expression can persist for weeks. Specifically, saRNA delivery enables highly efficient forward programming to Ngn2-induced neurons and enables measurement of functional reporters over time. We show that a single transfection of saRNA encoded jRCaMP1b reporter in hiPSCs generates sustained expression throughout differentiation to 3D cardiac spheroids. The persistence of the reporter allows measurement of calcium dynamics at a single-cell and population level over weeks, allowing tracking of cardiomyocyte maturation and drug responses. Together, our systematic analysis shows that saRNA provides sustained transgene expression in hiPSCs, supporting integration- free cell-fate programming and measurement of functional reporters in clinically relevant model systems.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35-GM143033;""},{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NSF-CAREER 2339986;""},{""name"":""Air Force Research Laboratory MURI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FA9550-22-1-0316;""},{""name"":""Institute for Collaborative Biotechnologies"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kz4p343"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""W911NF-19-2-0026;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Heart Lung and Blood"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 HL140471;""},{""name"":""MIT M-CELS"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Lisa Yang"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AG087374;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

A deeper understanding of how such programs shape physiological responses in dyads will illuminate the mechanisms of relationship formation. Across a six-session creative art-making program, we tracked cardiac synchrony (CS) within 31 intergenerational (older/younger adult) and 30 same generation (younger adult) dyads. Each session dyads completed self-report measures, then drew together and alone, while we recorded participants' actions with motion capture and their physiological signals (neural and cardiac) using fNIRS. Collaborative behaviour, self-reported social closeness, and interpersonal distance (i.e., proximity) showed group-specific patterns, whereby interpersonal distance emerged as a promising objective measure of relationship development. CS did not covary with group, task, an interaction thereof or any measure of behaviour or social closeness, yet there was a trending relationship between collaboration while drawing together and CS for intergenerational dyads only. This work has implications for understanding the mechanisms underpinning intergenerational social interaction and for the implementation of CS as an objective measure of social connection or collaboration.","[{""name"":""Social Brain Sciences Lab, ETH Zurich"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cortivision Pathfinder Programm"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CPP-2023/09/01;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Combining multiple length scales through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we unravel the distinct effect of the properties of NAs on the phase behavior and we propose a metric for the stability of biocondensates.

Dysregulation of microglial activation occurs in numerous brain disorders, and driving or inhibiting specific states could be therapeutic. To discover regulators of microglial activation states, we conducted CRISPR interference screens in iPSC-derived microglia for inhibitors and activators of six microglial states. We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models. Finally, we functionally characterized several regulators. STAT2 knockdown inhibits interferon response and lysosomal function. PRDM1 knockdown drives disease-associated and lipid-rich signatures and enhanced phagocytosis. DNMT1 knockdown results in widespread loss of methylation, activating negative regulators of interferon signaling. These findings provide a framework to direct microglial activation to selectively enrich microglial activation states, define their functional outputs, and inform future therapies.

Functional analysis of the endonuclease and RdRp activities reveals an enzyme which is capable of both activities and demonstrate RdRp inhibition by known antiviral nucleosides. These data advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind genome replication and transcription, that will help inform future antiviral development.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Comparative approaches can help distinguish conserved from species-specific mechanisms, but their application has been limited by the lack of molecular tools beyond traditional model organisms, complicating direct comparisons of conserved and divergent mechanisms of neural function. This gap is particularly evident for the dopaminergic system, a key regulator of motivated behaviors across species and the principal pharmacological target for current psychotherapies. Building on our recent development of comparative gene editing, we here present an adeno-associated virus-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to reduce in vivo dopamine receptors D1 and D2 levels across the rodent phylogeny. Using this approach, we achieved specific reduction of receptor levels in three rodent species (house mouse, prairie vole, and Syrian hamster), which we demonstrate with radioactive ligand binding assays. This toolkit expands the reach of comparative gene editing approaches, enabling functional investigation of the dopaminergic system across rodent species. Thereby, it supports comparative neuroscience by facilitating the identification of conserved versus species-specific neural mechanisms with enhanced translational potential.","[{""name"":""IKERBASQUE"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cc3fy72"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""NIH OD"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P51OD011132;""},{""name"":""NIMH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01MH122622;R01MH130755;""},{""name"":""Alfred P.

However, emerging viral variants have escaped all Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NAb treatments, underscoring the urgent need for effective therapeutic alternatives. Using a nanoluciferase (Nluc)-expressing attenuated recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the open reading frames (ORF) 3a and 7b ({Delta}3a7b-Nluc), we characterized resistance profiles of two broadly protective NAbs targeting the S receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (1301B7) and the stem helix domain (SH) in S2 (1249A8). Serial passaging of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc under selective pressure identified a 1301B7 antibody-resistant mutants (ARM-B7) harboring an RBD mutation (S371F) that conferred resistance to 1301B7 and other RBD-directed NAbs (Casirivimab, SC27 and Sotrovimab). In contrast, no ARM emerged under treatment with 1249A8, or an antibody cocktail of 1301B7 (RBD) + 1249A8 (SH). These findings demonstrate that S2 SH-targeting NAbs shows higher genetic barrier to resistance than S1 RBD-targeting NAbs, and that a NAbs cocktail therapy targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD and S2 SH offers the most effective strategy to prevent the emergence of escape mutations. Together, our findings provide critical insights into developing next-generation resistance-evading NAb therapies against SARS-CoV-2, and potentially other coronaviruses, and demonstrate the value of using our attenuated viral platforms for the safe identification of ARM without the potential biosafety concerns of doing these experiments using wild-type (WT) forms of SARS-CoV-2.

SIGNIFICANCEThe clinical efficacy of early SARS-CoV-2 NAbs has been challenged by the emergence of escape viral variants, highlighting an urgent need to anticipate resistance. Using a luminescent attenuated SARS-CoV-2 platform, we profiled resistant mutations against two broadly protective SARS-CoV-2 NAbs. Passage of {Delta}3a7b-Nluc in the presence of a NAb targeting the RBD S1 domain (1301B7) readily selected for an ARM, whereas passage in the presence of an SH S2 domain NAb (1249A8) did not. Notably, a cocktail of 1301B7 and 1249A8 created a high barrier of selecting SARS-CoV-2 ARM, preventing the emergence of resistant variants. We identified an S371F mutation in the S1 RBD of ARM-B7 that confers resistance to 1301B7 and other S1 RBD-targeting NAbs. These results highlight the importance of combination therapies targeting both variable RBD S1 and conserved SH S2 domain for the efficient treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent the emerge of NAb-induced escape mutations.","[{""name"":""NIAID"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01 AI161363;75N93021C00014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

We have dissected ssDNA gap dynamics following nucleoside analogue-mediated nascent strand termination and report a novel mechanism via which loss of the MRE11 negative regulator MRN-Interacting Protein (MRNIP) leads to MRE11 exonuclease-dependent suppression of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. This process is driven by UBC13 and the B-family TLS polymerase REV3L, suggesting that in the absence of MRNIP, dysregulated MRE11 activity at chain termination sites licenses gap filling via template switching. In the absence of PRIMPOL-dependent repriming, MRNIP loss leads to paradoxical SMARCAL1, MRE11 and primosome-dependent ssDNA gaps, suggesting that nucleolytic digestion of reversed forks generates DNA intermediates that platform primase redundancy in the context of chain termination. We also highlight novel site-specific roles for the anti-resection factor 53BP1 in enabling primase redundancy via suppression of the nuclease EXO1, and in limiting the EXO1-dependent processing of post-replicative ssDNA gaps. Finally, we demonstrate that CDK-dependent MRNIP phosphorylation is required for MRNIP functionality in the regulation of ssDNA gaps and sensitivity to chain terminators. This work represents the first report of nuclease-driven post-replicative gap filling, illuminates an additional level of versatility in the replication stress response, and expands our understanding of the context-dependent links between nuclease regulation and chemoresistance.","[{""name"":""UKRI"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/S034579/1;""},{""name"":""North West Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/025qv0671"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Cancer Research Wales"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01z7cky43"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

These chemically-identical ""mass tags"" conjugate to peptides to encode samples with different mass offsets for parallel analysis. The current state-of-the-art for multiplexing with non-isobaric mass tags was recently improved from 3-plex to 9-plex, but what is the largest plex size that can be reasonably achieved with current technology? A full answer to this question requires evaluating current mass spectrometry hardware, facets of which have been well-investigated by others. However, it may be under-appreciated that multiplexing 1000s of samples with mass tags does not actually require 1000s of isotopes, or 1000s of synthesis steps to create. Non-intuitively, high plex mass tags can require relatively few different isotopes. The focus of this exposition is to characterize the potential of the differential mass defect to create tens to over a thousand isotopologues of small molecules and how careful combinations of these small molecules can combinatorially scale the plex size to minimize synthetic steps. Importantly, we show that plex sizes in the hundreds, an order of magnitude greater than state-of-the-art, are achievable using molecules comparable in size to existing commercial tags, and that going beyond hundreds may require larger molecules. Approaches to achieve high-plex proteomics will almost certainly require using the differential mass defect, so we hope this exposition serves to accelerate progress in reagent development to achieve high plex proteomics.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

It facilitates molecular evolution and has been characterized in a variety of biological systems, but studies of prokaryotic promoters are limited. Prokaryotic promoters are non-coding DNA sequences that regulate transcription. The main housekeeping promoters ({sigma}70) share two sequence motifs called the -35 and the -10 box that are spaced 17{+/-}1 base pairs (bps) apart. The sequence of these boxes, their distance, and the existence of multiple nearby boxes can determine promoter strength, the ability of a promoter to drive high levels of transcription. Here we used computational modelling to show that the mutational robustness of {sigma}70 promoters - the persistence of promoter strength upon mutation - correlates with promoter strength itself. Mutational robustness is also influenced by potential overlaps between -10 and -35 boxes, and by specific positions within the boxes. It is higher when the boxes are exactly 17 bps apart. These findings can be partially explained by the flexibility of -35 boxes, which enables adjacent bases to create overlapping and new -35 boxes. Our work can help to engineer synthetic promoters for strength and robustness, and to understand the dynamics of promoter evolution.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""31003A_172887;310030_208174;""},{""name"":""University of Zurich"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02crff812"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FK-23-120;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

However, very few small molecules have been discovered that can modulate spliced mRNA formation or inhibit the splicing machinery itself. This study presents a novel high-throughput screening (HTS) platform for identifying compounds that modulate splicing. Our platform comprises a two-tiered screening approach: a primary screen measuring growth inhibition in sensitized in S. cerevisiae (yeast) strains and a secondary screen that relies on production of a fluorescent protein as a readout for splicing inhibition. Using this approach, we identified 4 small molecules that cause accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA in vivo in yeast. In addition, cancer cells expressing a myelodysplastic syndrome-associated splicing factor mutation (SRSF2P95H) are more sensitive to one of these compounds than those expressing the wild-type version of the protein. Transcriptome analyses showed that this compound causes widespread changes in gene expression in sensitive SRSF2P95H-expressing cells. Our results demonstrate the utility of using a yeast-based HTS to identify compounds capable of changing pre-mRNA splicing outcomes.","[{""name"":""Edward P.

We show that in addition Denisovans received gene flow from hominins that diverged before the split of the ancestors of Denisovans and modern humans. The two Denisovan genomes allow us to disentangle Denisovan ancestry in present-day humans revealing contributions from at least three distinct Denisovan groups. In particular, Oceanians and South Asians independently inherited DNA from a deeply diverged Denisovan population which was likely isolated in South Asia. This supports an early migration of the ancestors of Oceanians through South Asia followed by the later arrival of the ancestors of present-day South Asians. East Asians do not share this Denisovan component in their genomes, suggesting that their ancestors arrived independently, perhaps by a northerly route.

Here, we developed AF-CALVADOS, a coarse-grained simulation model that is informed by AlphaFold to model the dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins and multi-domain proteins containing mixtures of folded and disordered regions. AF-CALVADOS leverages information from AlphaFold 2 to model folded regions that we then integrate with the coarse-grained CALVADOS model. Our automated framework makes it possible to perform simulations of any soluble folded or disordered protein without manually defined folded regions, enabling scaling to the proteome level. We validate AF-CALVADOS using experimental data and consistency between our simulations and the AlphaFold 2 predicted aligned error matrix. We demonstrate the scalability of AF-CALVADOS by performing simulations of 12,483 cytosolic human proteins and make the data freely available; we envisage that large-scale simulation data generated by AF-CALVADOS can be used to benchmark or train machine learning models for flexible, multi-domain proteins.

Previously, phylogenetic approaches have been used to characterise the EBOV reservoir from the evolutionary relationships among observed human outbreaks. We here employ a novel phylogenetic latency model - inspired by recent observations of extreme EBOV evolutionary rate heterogeneity in humans - to characterise the natural history of EBOV and by extension its reservoir. We find the prevailing model of EBOV reservoir dynamics is deficient, and the long-term EBOV evolutionary rate is slower than previously believed. The hypothesis that EBOV diversity dates back to a bottleneck event just prior to the first human outbreak is not supported by the data. Further, our results suggest that EBOV undergoes extended periods of quiescence in the reservoir, similar to that observed in a small fraction of human infections.

Here, we studied the role of innate immune cells as potential effectors of vascular damage using a human in vitro 3D-BBB model. Parasite-stimulated immune cells from malaria-naive donors increased adhesion to microvessels, at least partly through LFA-1. This caused barrier disruption and inflammatory activation of BBB cells. Secretion of TNF-, IFN-{gamma}, and granzyme B by monocytes, NK and {gamma}{delta} T cells correlated with vascular injury, and accumulation of immune cells was required for local barrier damage.

BCI implants have targeted broad cortical regions known to have relevant motor representations, but emerging technologies will allow flexible targeting to specific neural populations. The structure of motor representations at this scale, however, has not been well characterized across frontal motor cortices. Here, we investigate how motor representations and population dynamics (temporal coordination) vary across a large expanse of frontal motor cortices. We used high-density, laminar, microelectrode arrays to simultaneously record many neurons and then sampled neural populations across frontal motor cortex in two monkeys while they performed a reaching task. Our experiments allowed us to map neuronal activity across three spatial dimensions and relate them to movement. Target decoding analysis revealed that task information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical surface and in depth. Similarly, we found that the temporal dynamics of different neural populations were heterogeneous, but that the amount of task information predicted which neural populations had similar dynamics. The neural populations with the most similar dynamics were composed of neurons with high task information regardless of spatial location. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal complexity of motor representations across frontal motor cortex at the level of neurons and neural populations, where well-learned movements consistently recruit a spatially distributed subset of neurons. Further insights into the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity patterns across frontal motor cortex will be critical to guide future implants for improved BCI performance.

Significance StatementMotor brain-computer interfaces (BCI) translate neural activity into movement, but how to target implants within motor cortices to maximize performance remains unclear. We used high-density recordings of neural activity spanning a large cortical area and related them to movement to map the spatial distribution of task information and the evolution of neural population activity over time. Our measurements revealed that neurons with the most task information were heterogeneously distributed across cortex yet also evolved coherently in time, suggesting that spatially distributed neurons coordinate to control movements. Our results provide new links between neuron- and population-level maps of motor representations, and highlight the complex spatiotemporal structure of activity that may need to be considered when designing next-generation BCIs.","[{""name"":""National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""TL1 TR002318;""},{""name"":""Heiwa Nakajima Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/000k40t10"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Graduate Fellowship;""},{""name"":""Weill Neurohub"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""postdoctoral fellowship;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Simons Collaboration for the Global Brain Pilot award, 898220;""},{""name"":""U.S. National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2117997;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01s5ya894"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NIH R01 NS134634;UF1NS126485;""},{""name"":""Office of Research Infrastructure Programs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01jdyfj45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P51 OD010425;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

We introduce a population-scale framework that unites three unprecedented resources: whole genome data from 504,000 individuals in the Emirati Genome Program (EGP); electronic health record (EHR) data from 426,000 of these participants through phenoEGP, phenotype resource derived from Malaffi; and genetically reconstructed pedigrees, made possible by the rich familial structures within the EGP. Together, these datasets enable real-world penetrance estimation of rare variants at a population scale, stratification of individuals and families by clinical actionability, and the discovery of novel IRD-associated variants. Among 1,879 known variants, we found 96 high or complete penetrance, supporting clinical integration, while 36 showed null penetrance, warranting reclassification. We identified 2,131 asymptomatic individuals and 1,013 families as potential candidates for preventive care. Using phenotype-first familial prioritization, we identified 69 likely pathogenic variants among high-disease-burden families, including a novel biallelic BBS12 variant confirmed through cross-cohort screening.

The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), classically defined as the maintenance methyltransferase that preserves DNA methylation patterns during replication, exemplifies this versatility. Beyond its canonical role, DNMT1 is highly expressed in the developing and adult brain, where it contributes to transcriptional regulation in postmitotic neurons. Notably, cytoplasmic DNMT1 localization has been observed in neural cells, and emerging evidence links DNMT1 to mitochondrial function with implications for neurodegenerative disease, whereby the underlying functional mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated.

Here, we identify a previously unrecognized cytosolic function of DNMT1 in developing cortical excitatory neurons. Through genetic perturbation, proteomics, and high-resolution imaging, we show that DNMT1 regulates dendritic and axonal branching independently of its catalytic activity and nuclear localization. Instead, DNMT1 operates as a cytosolic scaffold interacting with the polarity regulator DOCK7 to modulate Rac1-STMN1 signaling, microtubule dynamics, and organelle trafficking. These findings expand the conceptual framework of DNMT1 from a genome guardian to a dual-compartment regulator that coordinates cytoskeletal remodeling and mitochondrial positioning. Beyond advancing our understanding of neuronal morphogenesis, this work provides mechanistic insight into how DNMT1 mutations may lead to neurodegenerative diseases.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ZI-1224/13-1;ZI-1224/13-1;368482240/GRK2416;""},{""name"":""Excellence Strategy of the Federal Government and the Länder"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""OPSF678;OPSF812;SFASIA002;""},{""name"":""European Union&#8722;NextGenerationEU-HEAL ITALIA"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PE00000019;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Oct4, a master regulator of pluripotency, exemplifies this capacity as it can bind nucleosome-occupied DNA. Yet, how Oct4 reshapes chromatin fibres beyond the scale of a single nucleosome has remained unclear. Here, we harness our near-atomistic coarse-grained chromatin model to dissect how full-length Oct4 interacts with chromatin fibres of varying nucleosomal repeat lengths. We find that Oct4 increases DNA accessibility not by decondensing chromatin, but by driving fibres into compact liquid-like states in which nucleosomes breathe, reorient, exchange neighbours, and transiently expose DNA. Oct4 binds preferentially to linker DNA through its structured POU domains, while its disordered activation domains mediate cluster formation: a three-stage process consisting of nucleation of small clusters, attachment to chromatin via the DNA binding domains, and growth that is amplified when long DNA linkers enable fibre bending and looping. Oct4 clusters deform chromatin and bridge distal DNA segments in a stoichiometry- and linker length-dependent manner, revealing a tunable mechanism for controlling higher-order structure. Together, our results establish how Oct4 exploits multivalency, nucleosome breathing, and chromatin flexibility to reorganise fibres into liquid-like states that reconcile condensation with enhanced accessibility, providing a physical route to overcome the transcription-factor  search problem and activate silenced genes during reprogramming.","[{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0439y7842"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X02332X/1;EP/Z002028/1;EP/X035603/1;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""803326;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability.

To visualize the nanoscale arrangement of exocytic locations, we developed a novel correlative live-cell/two - color, single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) approach. We observed that regions of exocytosis are devoid of the submembrane spectrin mesh, with these spectrin-free areas being spatially separated from the spectrin clearings that contain clathrin-coated pits.

Here, we developed a new computational framework to minimize negative transfer for domain-adaptive brain decoding by reframing source selection as a mixture model parameter estimation problem, allowing each source subject to contribute through a continuous mixture weight rather than being outright included or excluded. To compute these weights, we developed a novel convex optimization algorithm based on the Generalized Method of Moments. By using model performance metrics as the generalized moment functions in our GMM optimization, our algorithm also provides theoretical guarantees that the mixture weights are an optimal approximation of the importance weights that underlie domain adaptation theory. When tested on a large-scale brain decoding dataset (n=105 subjects), our new mixture model weighting framework achieved state-of-the-art performance--increasing accuracy up to 2.5% over baseline fine-tuning, double the performance gain compared to previous research in supervised source selection. Notably, these improvements were achieved using significantly less training data (i.e., 62% smaller effective sample sizes), suggesting that our performance gains stem from reduced negative transfer.

While clonal expansions in the hematopoietic system have been extensively characterized and reported to be nearly ubiquitous, clonal mosaicism (CM) has more recently also been described across multiple solid tissues. However, outstanding questions remain about the parameters and processes of human somatic evolution in non-cancerous solid human tissues, including when clones arise, how they evolve over time, and what mechanisms lead to their expansion. Questions of timing and clonal dynamics can be addressed through phylogenetic reconstruction, which serves as a  temporal microscope, while uncovering the mechanisms of expansion necessitates simultaneous phenotypic profiling. To address this gap, here we develop Single-cell Miniaturized Automated Reverse Transcription and Primary Template-directed Amplification (SMART-PTA) for joint single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing for large scale and cost efficient interrogation of solid tissue CM. We established a workflow that generates hundreds of matched single-cell whole genome and transcriptome libraries within a week. We profiled phenotypically normal esophagus tissue from four aged donors and used somatic variants to build high-resolution single-cell lineages from >2,700 cells with accompanying transcriptomic information, reconstructing >70 years of somatic evolution. T cell expansions identified from T cell receptor (TCR) sequences validated the clonal structure of the single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based phylogenies and phylogenetic cross-correlation analysis showed that epithelial cells had higher degrees of shared ancestry by spatial location compared to immune cells. Mapping mutation signatures to the phylogenetic tree revealed the emergence of tobacco/alcohol exposure-related signatures later in life, consistent with the donors exposure histories. We identified variants in driver genes that were previously reported in the phenotypically normal esophagus, detecting clonal expansions harboring mutations in genes including TP53 and FAT1. We mapped the evolution of clones with both monoallelic as well as biallelic TP53 loss, including a clone associated with high expression of cell cycling genes and higher chromosome instability. Leveraging the matched transcriptome data, we uncovered cell type biases in mutant clones, with a higher proportion of TP53 or FAT1-mutant cells in an earlier basal epithelial cell state compared to wild-type cells. We further observed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNLOH) events on chromosome 9q that spanned the NOTCH1 locus in up to [~]35% of epithelial cells. Mapping CNLOH events to the phylogenetic tree revealed a striking pattern in which CNLOH was separately acquired many times, reflecting convergent evolution. Cells with CNLOH events were biased towards the earlier basal epithelial state, suggestive of a selective advantage that leads to prevalent recurrence of chr9q CNLOH. Together, we demonstrate that SMART-PTA is an efficient, scalable approach for single-cell whole-genome and whole-transcriptome profiling to build phenotypically annotated single-cell phylogenies with enough throughput and power for application to normal tissue somatic evolution. Moreover, we reconstruct the evolutionary history of the esophageal epithelium at high scale and resolution, providing a window into the dynamics and processes that shape clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues throughout a lifespan.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""UG3NS132139;""},{""name"":""National Cancer Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/040gcmg81"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R33 CA267219;""},{""name"":""NIDDK"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P30 DK132710;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RM1HG011014;""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01d35cw23"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Career Award for Medical Scientists;""},{""name"":""Vallee Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/05nmp3276"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Scholar Award;""},{""name"":""Blood Cancer United"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00v7th354"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""MacMillan Family Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

A promising strategy for ""proteome editing"" is to use bifunctional molecules (e.g. PROteolysis-Targeting Chimeras or PROTACs1) that bring a target protein into proximity with a degradation or stabilization effector, but their broader application is constrained by a limited repertoire of well-characterized target or effector ""handles"". We asked whether coupling de novo protein design to a multiplex screening framework could address this gap by accelerating the discovery of effector handles for intracellular protein degradation, stabilization, or relocalization. Using LABEL-seq2, a sequencing-based assay that enables multiplex, quantitative measurement of protein abundance, we screened 9,715 de novo designed candidate effector handles for their ability to recruit a target protein to components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system3 (UPS) (FBXL12, TRAF2, UCHL1, USP38) or the autophagy pathway4 (GABARAP, GABARAPL2, MAP1LC3A). In a single experiment, we discovered hundreds of de novo designed effector handles that reproducibly drove either intracellular degradation (n = 277) or stabilization (n = 204) of a reporter protein. Validation of a subset of these hits in an orthogonal assay confirmed that sequencing-based measurements from the primary screen reliably reflected changes in intracellular abundance of the target protein. Successful effector handles were discovered for both the UPS (n = 194) and autophagy (n = 287) pathways, which provide complementary routes for programmable proteome editing. Autophagy-recruiting effector handles generalized to endogenous targets, as substituting the reporter-specific target handle with a high-affinity MCL1 binder5 reduced endogenous levels of this intracellular oncoprotein6. Moreover, directing autophagy-recruiting effector handles to the outer mitochondrial membrane dramatically perturbed mitochondrial networks in a manner consistent with synthetic tethering and sequestration7,8. Beyond generating a diverse repertoire of protein abundance or localization effector handles, our results establish a scalable, low-cost platform that links deep learning-guided protein design to functional cellular readouts, and chart a course toward a general framework for programmable proteome editing.","[{""name"":""National Heart Lung and Blood Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012pb6c26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31HL168982;""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""T32GM136534;""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""INV-043758;""},{""name"":""National Human Genome Research Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00baak391"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HG010632;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1189761 (Joshi);1283731 (Joshi);542981 (Frank);""},{""name"":""Life Sciences Research Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0195dxj21"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Joshi;""},{""name"":""NSF GRFP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1650113 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""nih"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F31MH124366 (Comrie);""},{""name"":""UCSF Jonas Cohler Discovery Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Comrie;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""F30MH126483 (Guidera);""},{""name"":""UCSF Discovery 411 Fellowship"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Phi Beta Kappa Graduate Award"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Guidera;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Frank;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

To ensure faithful gene expression, functional pA+ RNPs, including protein-coding RNPs, are exported to the cytoplasm, while transcripts within non-functional pA+ RNPs are degraded in the nucleus1-4. How cells distinguish these opposing fates remains unknown. The DExD-box ATPase UAP56/DDX39B is a central component of functional pA+ RNPs, promoting their docking to the nuclear pore complex (NPC)-anchored  transcription and export complex 2 (TREX-2) (ref.5,6), which triggers transcript release from UAP56 to facilitate export (ref.7,8). Here, we uncover that the  Poly(A) tail exosome targeting (PAXT) connection9 harbors its own TREX-2-like module, which releases pA+ RNAs from UAP56 for decay by the nuclear exosome. The core of this module consists of a LENG8-PCID2-SEM1 (LENG8-PS) trimer, which we show is structurally and functionally equivalent to the central GANP-PCID2-SEM1 (GANP-PS) trimer of TREX-2. Mutagenesis and transcriptomic data demonstrate that the nuclear fate of pA+ RNPs is governed by the contending actions of nucleoplasmic PAXT and NPC-associated TREX-2, which interpret RNA-bound UAP56 as a signal for RNA decay or export, respectively. As RNA targets of PAXT are generally short and intron-poor, we propose an overall model for pA+ RNP fate determination, whereby the distinct sub-nuclear localizations of PAXT and TREX-2 govern the degradation of short non-functional pA+ RNAs while allowing export of their longer and functional counterparts.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species. Mechanistically, ORF7a upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), promoting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex phosphorylation and suppressing pyruvate oxidation. However, pharmacological PDK4 inhibition did not restore respiration. High-resolution respirometry in frozen samples revealed impaired complex I function, while Blue Native-PAGE demonstrated defective respiratory supercomplex assembly. By linking enzymatic inhibition with structural destabilization, our study uncovers a functional vulnerability of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to viral manipulation.

However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how external and internal variables coordinate social action through networks of hormone-sensitive neurons. In particular, while gonadal hormones have long been suggested to coordinate territorial behaviors, direct evidence of how this coordination occurs has been lacking. To answer this, we combined large-scale neural recordings with large-scale unsupervised behavioral quantification1 to track neural activity longitudinally across a hormonal perturbation. We recorded neural population activity from neurons expressing the hormone receptor estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) as well as from local ER- neurons across the subcortical Social Behavior Network (SBN) and compared neural responses and behavior across social contexts with varied partners and territories. Using a comprehensive behavioral quantification strategy, we observe that patterns of social action and their underlying neural dynamics differentiate social partner and territory in both sexes. We find that each context has a unique behavioral action code, and that territory naturally rescales the partner-specific social action code in the hormonally intact state. However, when levels of circulating gonadal hormones are reduced, we observe that patterns of behavior during interactions in the home territory in males are disrupted, and that these changes can be rescued by testosterone replacement. Critically, hormonal perturbation disrupts territorial rescaling in a population-specific manner. Together, these data demonstrate how a loss of circulating hormones alters the relationship between social context and social action to disrupt context-specific social decision making.","[{""name"":""NIH Common Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001d55x84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""K99MH135212;F32MH126562;DP2MH126375;R01MH126035;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Allen Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03cpe7c52"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""New York Stem Cell Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03n2a3p06"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""McKnight Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/003ghvj67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

In this work, we present mBER, an open-source protein binder design system capable of designing antibody-format binders with state-of-the-art experimental success rates. mBER builds on the ColabDesign framework, achieving successful antibody design primarily through the inclusion of informative sequence and structure conditioning information.

We experimentally screened the two libraries against 145 of these targets, resulting in a dataset of over 100 million binding interactions. We achieved specific and significant design success against 45% of targets. In a filtered set of designs, we detect binding rates to specific epitopes as high as 38%.

Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health appears to be unrelated to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Rather, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone.

We extent these findings to infection contexts, showing that arbitrium signalling influences outcomes in cells harbouring prophages with compatible communicating systems. These findings reveal that phages engage in cross-species communication, a trait restricted to more complex life forms, challenging our understanding of how these elements reshape microbial communities.","[{""name"":""Spanish Government (Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PID2022-137201NB-I00;""},{""name"":""Valencian Government"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CIPROM/2023/30;""},{""name"":""European Commission NextGenerationEU fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""(EU 2020/2094);""},{""name"":""European Research Council grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101118890 (TalkingPhages);""},{""name"":""Medical Research Council (UK)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MR/X020223/1;MR/M003876/1;MR/V000772/1;""},{""name"":""Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC, UK)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BB/V002376/1;BB/V009583/1;""},{""name"":""Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC, UK)"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X026671/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Using GPX1 and GPX4, selenoenzymes that mitigate oxidative stress, as reporters, we performed genome-wide knockout screens to identify regulators of selenocysteine incorporation. This revealed that selenoprotein production is limited by ribosome collisions that occur at inefficiently decoded selenocysteine codons. Accordingly, slowed translation elongation reduced collisions and enhanced selenocysteine decoding. Oxidative stress also slowed translation elongation and augmented selenoprotein production. We identified translation elongation factor EEF1G as a sensor of oxidized glutathione that couples the cellular redox state to translation elongation rate. Oxidative stress sensing by EEF1G slows translation, enhancing production of detoxifying selenoproteins to restore homeostasis. These findings reveal how programmed ribosome collisions enable gene regulation in response to stress.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01CA282036;U01CA305105;S10OD030312-01;""},{""name"":""Welch Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00np6vq88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""I-1961;""},{""name"":""Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0003xa228"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RP220309;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Little is known, however, about whether and how phages can establish long-term genetic stability. We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages. We suggest that ecological context can favor the long-term maintenance of viral lineages and stabilize MGE persistence in the ocean, even amid ongoing mutation and antagonistic co-evolution.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""884988;""},{""name"":""Canada Excellence Research Chairs"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02tvrwm90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-00051;""},{""name"":""FRQ-NT, Fonds des leaders John-R.-Evans"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""44584;""},{""name"":""ANR"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""20-CE35-0014;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Using polymer simulations and high-resolution live-cell microscopy, we identify rare but long-lived chromatin encounters arising from cohesin-mediated loop extrusion. These events occur when cohesin loads near the midpoint between two loci and extrudes them through a defined spatial radius, producing encounter durations that exceed those of random collisions. We show that such encounters explain observed nonlinear relationships between contact probability and transcription, and accurately predict transcriptional changes upon perturbation of cohesin or its cofactors. Our findings support a time-gated model of distal enhancer-promoter communication in which only rare, long-lived and mostly extrusion-driven encounters are productive, offering a unifying framework for how chromosome dynamics control transcription in single cells.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""310030_192642;TMCG-3_213782;320030-236070;""},{""name"":""EMBO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 1305-2024;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

However, while considerable advances have been made in the de novo design of protein structure and function, the same has not yet been achieved for RNA tertiary structures of similar intricacy. Here, we describe a generative diffusion framework, RFDpoly, for generalized de novo biopolymer (RNA, DNA and protein) design, and use it to create diverse and designable RNA structures. We design RNA structures with novel folds and experimentally validate them using a combination of chemical footprinting (SHAPE-seq) and electron microscopy. We further use this approach to design protein-nucleic acid assemblies; the crystal structure of one such design is nearly identical to the design model. This work demonstrates that the principles of structure-based de novo protein design can be extended to nucleic acids, opening the door to creating a wide range of new RNA structures and protein-nucleic acid complexes.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has allowed proteome-scale quantification of hundreds of thousands of ubiquitination sites (ubi-sites), however the functional importance and regulatory roles of most ubi-sites remain undefined. Here, we assembled a human reference ubiquitinome of 108,341 ubi-sites by harmonizing public proteomics data. We identified a core subset of ubi-sites under evolutionary constraint through alignment of ubiquitin proteomics data from six non-human species, and determined ultra-conserved ubi-sites recurring at regulatory hotspots within protein domains. Perturbation proteomics revealed that these highly conserved ubi-sites are more likely to regulate signaling functions rather than proteasomal degradation. To further prioritize functional ubi-sites with roles in cellular signaling, we constructed a functional score for more than 100,000 ubi-sites by integrating evolutionary, proteomic, and structural features using machine learning. Our score identifies ubi-sites regulating diverse protein functions and rationalizes mechanisms of genetic disease. Finally, we employed chemical genomics to validate the functional relevance of high-scoring ubi-sites and leveraged genetic code expansion to demonstrate that ubiquitination of K320 in the RNA-regulator ELAVL1 disrupts RNA binding. Our work reveals systems-level principles of the ubiquitinome and provides a powerful resource for studying protein ubiquitination.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

In the mammalian cortex, one of the few systems where such transformations are tractable is the spatial mapping circuit. This circuit comprises interconnected regions of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and hippocampus, which encode location using fundamentally different neural codes. A key distinction is that neural activity in MEC, including that of directionally tuned cells and grid cells, evolves along low-dimensional manifolds, preserving stable phase relationships across different environments and behaviors1-8. In contrast, hippocampal place cells frequently undergo global remapping: their collective firing patterns reorganize randomly across different environments9-12, revealing an apparently limitless repertoire of orthogonal spatial representations12-14. The mechanisms by which spatial maps are transformed between the two coding schemes remain unresolved. Here, we used large-scale multi-area Neuropixels recordings to show that when rats were transferred from one familiar environment to another, each module of grid cells underwent a unique change in phase on its low-dimensional manifold, at the same time as simultaneously recorded place cells exhibited global remapping. In contrast, training conditions that produced smaller differences in the phase shifts of simultaneously recorded grid modules resulted in incomplete place cell remapping, mirroring previous reports of  partial remapping15-19. Hippocampal remapping was not associated with rotational differences between grid modules under any condition. Taken together, these findings suggest that differential phase shifts across grid cell modules form the basis for the orthogonalization of downstream hippocampal spatial codes during remapping. The transformation from low-dimensional spatial representations in the MEC to high-dimensional codes in the hippocampus may underlie the hippocampus ability to support high-capacity memory storage3,13,14,20-22.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""951319;""},{""name"":""The Research Council of Norway"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00epmv149"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""223262;332640;295721;""},{""name"":""The Kavli Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00kztt736"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ministry of Education and Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03wv1cb14"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1761430130561

Here, we characterize the tripartite symbiosis in a benthic dinoflagellate (Sinophysis sp.) using diverse single-cell methods. Sinophysis houses a photosynthetic cyanobacterium closely interacting with an alphaproteobacterial endosymbiont. The cyanobacterium is in the intermediate stage of symbiont-to-organelle transition, with the host likely supporting it with metabolites and proteins, and controlling its cell division. Surprisingly, it seems to have replaced the hosts remnant non-photosynthetic plastid.

Sebum-based diagnostic methods using commercial oil-blotting films have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 detection in humans, yet equivalent strategies for veterinary use remain largely unexplored. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), presents a major health threat in Asia--especially in Japan, where multiple cases of cat-to-veterinarian transmission have been reported. To address the need for safer diagnostics, we sought to establish a sebum-based RNA virus detection method for cats. We designed primers that efficiently detected RNA from feline sebum while distinguishing it from human and feline DNA/RNA. Using this platform, we determined the ear to be the optimal sebum collection site and confirmed that feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) RNA can be reliably identified from ear sebum with sensitivity comparable to conventional blood-based testing. In addition, we detected SFTSV RNA from sebum samples of infected cat. Our findings introduce a minimally invasive, safe diagnostic platform for feline viral infections, reducing animal distress while safeguarding veterinarians and pet owners from zoonotic risks.
