As early studies grappled with random error and insufficient information, incongruence or lack of resolution in phylogenomics is generally associated with inadequate modeling of biological phenomena combined with analytical issues leading to systematic biases. Few phylogenomic studies, however, explore the potential for random error or establish an expectation of what level of resolution should be expected from a given empirical dataset. In presenting incongruent results, phylogeneticists face a choice of providing a diverse array of results from different approaches or a single preferred tree, with few attempting to integrate uncertainties across methods. Recent phylogenetic work has uncovered many well-supported and often novel relationships, as well as more contentious findings, across the phylogeny of ants. Ants are the most species-rich lineage of social insects and among the most ecologically important terrestrial animals. As a result, they have attracted much research, including regarding systematics. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive genus-level phylogeny of the ants inferred using genomic data combined with an effort to evaluate signal and incongruence throughout. Here we provide deeper insight into and quantify uncertainty across the ant tree of life. We accomplish this with the most taxonomically comprehensive Ultraconserved Elements dataset to date, including 277 (81%) of recognized ant genera from all 16 extant subfamilies, representing over 98% of described species-level diversity. We use simulations to establish expectations for resolution, identify branches with less-than-expected concordance, and dissect the effects of data and model selection on recalcitrant nodes. We also construct a consensus tree integrating uncertainty from multiple analyses. Simulations show that hundreds of loci are needed to resolve recalcitrant nodes on our genus-level ant phylogeny, even under a best-case scenario of known model parameters and without systematic bias. This demonstrates that random error continues to play a role in phylogenomics. Our analyses provide a comprehensive picture of support and incongruence across the ant phylogeny, and our consensus topology is congruent with a recent phylogenomic study on the subfamily-level, while rendering a more realistic picture of uncertainty and significantly expanding generic sampling. We use this topology for divergence dating and find that assumptions about root age have significant impact on the dates inferred. Our results suggest that improved understanding of ant phylogeny will require both more data and better phylogenetic models. We also provide a workflow to identify under-supported nodes in concatenation analyses, outline a pragmatic way to reconcile conflicting results in phylogenomics, and introduce a user-friendly locus selection tool for divergence dating.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Here, we used de novo protein structure modeling and sensitive sequence similarity detection algorithms within an expanded Asgard archaeal genomic dataset to build a structural catalogue of the Asgard archaeal pangenome and identify 908 new isomorphic ESPs (iESPs), representing clusters of protein structures most similar to eukaryotic proteins and that likely underwent extensive sequence divergence. While most previously identified ESPs were involved in cellular processes and signaling, iESPs are enriched in information storage and processing functions, with several being potentially implicated in facilitating cellular complexity. By expanding the complement of eukaryotic proteins in Asgard archaea, this study indicates that the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes was more complex than previously assumed.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

However, limited sampling of these archaea constrains our understanding of their ecology and evolution, including their anticipated role in eukaryogenesis. Here, we nearly double the number of Asgardarchaeota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 869, including 136 new Heimdallarchaeia (49 Hodarchaeales) and several novel lineages. Examining global distribution revealed Hodarcheales are primarily found in coastal marine sediments. Detailed analysis of their metabolic capabilities revealed guilds of Heimdallarchaeia are distinct from other Asgardarchaeota. These archaea encode hallmarks of aerobic eukaryotes, including electron transport chain complexes (III and IV), biosynthesis of heme, and response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The predicted structural architecture of Heimdallarchaeia membrane-bound hydrogenases includes additional Complex-I-like subunits potentially increasing the proton motive force and ATP synthesis. Heimdallarchaeia genomes encode CoxD, which regulates the electron transport chain (ETC) in eukaryotes. Thus, key hallmarks for aerobic respiration may have been present in the Asgard-eukaryotic ancestor. Moreover, we found that Heimdallarchaeia is present in a variety of oxic marine environments. This expanded diversity reveals these Archaea likely conferred energetic advantages during early stages of eukaryogenesis, fueling cellular complexity.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Mobile integrons spread antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, while the sedentary chromosomal integrons contain up to hundreds of cassettes of unknown function. Here, we show that many of these cassettes encode anti-phage defence systems. We found numerous streamlined variants of known systems, which have presumably evolved to fit the small size constraints of integron cassettes recombination and genesis. Intrigued by the rarity of known systems in the sedentary chromosomal integron of the Vibrio cholerae 7th cholera pandemic strain, we tested the presence of anti-phage functions in all its cassettes of unknown function. We found that at least 16 of the strain cassettes have an anti-phage activity in V. cholerae or E. coli. This represents 18% of the tested cassettes and almost 10% of all the integron cassettes, providing at long last a key adaptive role for a significant fraction of the sedentary integrons. Most of the newly discovered systems have little or no similarity to previously known ones and our experiments show that several mediate defence through cell lysis or growth arrest. One of these systems encodes a 64 amino acids protein, which represents the smallest known protein providing autonomous phage resistance. Given the thousands of uncharacterized integron cassette families, integrons could represent an untapped treasure trove of streamlined anti-phage systems.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Although nucleolar associated domains (NADs) have been recently mapped, the mechanisms of NAD association with nucleoli and the functional significance of their localization remain unclear. Here, we show that NAD association with nucleoli is mediated by nucleophosmin (NPM1), a factor located within the granular component, the outer layer of the nucleolus. NPM1 binds NADs, interacts with the histone lysine methyltransferase G9a (EHMT2), and is required for establishing H3K9me2 at NADs. Loss of NPM1 or expression of NPM1 mutant lacking the DNA binding domain (NPM1{Delta}DBD) caused NAD dissociation from nucleoli and H3K9me2 reduction specifically at NADs. G9a is dispensable for NAD contacts with nucleoli and interacts with NPM1{Delta}DBD, indicating that NADs acquire G9a-mediated H3K9me2 only after associating with NPM1 at nucleoli. The results provide mechanistic insights into how genomic domains associate with nucleoli and acquire their repressive chromatin state. Additionally, our findings suggest that the nucleolus not only serves as a scaffold for positioning repressive chromatin domains but also plays a direct role in establishing these chromatin states.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Traditionally, miniscopes have only been able to record from a single fluorescence wavelength. Here, we present a new open-source dual-channel Miniscope that simultaneously records two wavelengths in freely behaving animals, providing more flexibility and function. To enable simultaneous acquisition of two fluorescent wavelengths, we incorporated two CMOS sensors with two independent sets of emission filters into a single Miniscope. This enables us to acquire images at the full frame rate that the CMOS sensor supports while simultaneously eliminating crosstalk between channels, which allows imaging fluorophores that heavily overlap in their emission spectrums (for example, GFP and tdTomato). We adopted a design that enables adjusting the position of one imaging sensor along the light path to match the focal plane of the other sensor, providing additional flexibility for calibration. To validate our dual-channel Miniscope in vivo, we imaged hippocampal CA1 region that co-expressed a dynamic calcium indicator (GCaMP) and a static nuclear signal (constitutively active tdTomato) while mice ran on a linear track. We used GCaMP signals to investigate spatial coding in the hippocampus and tdTomato signals as a landmark for registration of neurons across recording sessions. Our results suggest that, even when neurons were registered across recording sessions using tdTomato signals, hippocampal spatial coding changes over time as previously reported. In conclusion, our novel dual-channel Miniscope enables imaging of two fluorescence wavelengths in the same focal plane with minimal crosstalk between the two channels, opening the doors to a multitude of new experimental possibilities.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Using whole animal screens in genetically engineered mouse models of cancer we have identified circulating metabolites associated with metastasis. Specifically, we highlight the pyrimidine uracil as a prominent metastasis-associated metabolite. Uracil is generated by neutrophils expressing the enzyme uridine phosphorylase-1 (UPP1), and neutrophil specific Upp1 expression is increased in cancer. Altered UPP1 activity influences expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of neutrophils, leading to decreased neutrophil motility in the pre-metastatic lung. Furthermore, we find that UPP1-expressing neutrophils suppress T-cell proliferation, and the UPP1 product uracil can increase fibronectin deposition in the extracellular microenvironment. Consistently, knockout or inhibition of UPP1 in mice with mammary tumours increases the number of T-cells and reduces fibronectin content in the lung and decreases the proportion of mice that develop lung metastasis. These data indicate that UPP1 influences neutrophil behaviour and extracellular matrix deposition in the lung and suggest that pharmacological targeting of this pathway could be an effective strategy to reduce metastasis.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

This review examines the trends in SCD among pilots from a global perspective, analyzing evidence from 2011 to 2023, with a focus on its growing impact as a global crisis and recent findings pointing to a potential rise in incidence, particularly after 2019.

MethodsA systematic search of peer-reviewed literature, international aviation databases, and pilot associations was conducted to identify relevant data. The analysis focused on trends in SCD prevalence, risk factors, prevention strategies, and recent findings, including the potential impact of COVID-19, the role of vaccination, and important biomarkers to screen for predisposition.

ResultsRecent studies suggest a potential increase in SCD incidence among pilots following the COVID-19 pandemic. Cardiovascular complications, increased stress, disruptions in healthcare, and changes in lifestyle may contribute to this potential rise. Biomarkers such as troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have been identified as potential indicators of increased SCD risk in pilots.

ConclusionSCD remains a significant and rising threat to pilots, posing a global crisis that requires immediate attention. Through a comprehensive approach that includes risk assessment, preventive measures, emergency response, and preventive protocols, the aviation industry can mitigate this risk and safeguard the lives of pilots and passengers.

The proposed standardized examination protocol for pilots includes regular cardiovascular risk assessment, biomarker screening, monitoring of COVID-19 and vaccination status, lifestyle modifications, and a standardized reporting system.

Aging-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis5,6, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here, using physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered mouse models and primary cells7,8, we demonstrate aging suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by aging-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, leading to a functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1--lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescue stemness and promote tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1-- lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells via induction of ferroptosis. We find that aging-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites associates with elevated NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells by inhibition of DNA methylation. We uncover that aging drives a functional iron insufficiency, which leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis, but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate in young individuals, revealing a critical window for such cancer prevention efforts.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Neural replay of task representations is a candidate mechanism by which the brain learns such relational information or samples from a learned model in the service of adaptive behavior. Here, we tested whether cortical reactivation is related to learning higher-order sequential relationships without consciousness. Human participants viewed sequences of images that followed probabilistic transitions determined by ring-like graph structures. Behavioral modeling revealed that participants acquired multi-step transition knowledge through gradual updating of an internal successor representation (SR) model, although half of participants did not indicate conscious knowledge about the sequential task structure. To investigate neural replay, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns during brief 10 seconds pauses from the ongoing statistical learning task. We found evidence for backward sequential replay of multi-step sequences in visual cortical areas. These findings indicate that implicit learning of higher-order relationships establishes an internal SR-based map of the task, and is accompanied by cortical on-task replay.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

However, increasing evidence shows that calcium influx in neurological diseases is augmented by calcium-permeable AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Here, we demonstrate that these calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) are inhibited by memantine. Electrophysiology unveils that memantine inhibition of CP-AMPARs is dependent on their calcium permeability and the presence of their neuronal auxiliary subunit transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). Through cryo-electron microscopy we elucidate that memantine blocks CP-AMPAR ion channels in a unique mechanism of action from NMDARs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that memantine reverses a gain of function AMPAR mutation found in a patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder and inhibits CP-AMPARs in nerve injury.

We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans.

Nanotiming solely demands the labelling of asynchronously growing cells with an innocuous dose of BrdU during one doubling time followed by BrdU quantification along nanopore reads. We demonstrate in yeast S. cerevisiae that Nanotiming precisely reproduces RT profiles generated by reference methods in wild-type and mutant cells inactivated for known RT determinants, for one-tenth of the cost. Nanotiming is simple, accurate, inexpensive, amenable to large-scale analyses, and is capable of unveiling RT at individual telomeres, revealing that Rif1 iconic telomere regulator directly delays the replication only of telomeres with specific subtelomeric elements.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive due to their complexity and clinical heterogeneity of patients with DGBIs. We aimed to identify neuroimmune pathways that are critical in microbiota-gut-brain communication during de novo gut colonization.

MethodsWe employed a combination of gnotobiotic and state-of-the-art microbial tools, behavioral analysis, immune and pharmacological approaches. Germ-free wild type, MyD88-/- Ticam1-/- and SCID mice were studied before and after colonization with specific pathogen-free microbiota, Altered Schaedler Flora, E. coli or S. typhimurium (permanent or transient colonizers). TLR agonists and antagonists, CCR7 antagonist or immunomodulators were used to study immune pathways. We assessed brain c-Fos, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and dendritic and glial cells by immunofluorescence, expression of neuroimmune genes by NanoString and performed brain proteomics.

ResultsBacterial monocolonization, conventionalization or administration of microbial products to germ-free mice altered mouse behavior similarly, acting through Toll-like receptor or nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain signaling. The process required CD11b+CD11c+CD103+ cell activation and migration into the brain. The change in behavior did not require the continued presence of bacteria and was associated with activation of multiple neuro-immune networks in the gut and the brain.

ConclusionsChanges in neural plasticity occur rapidly upon initial gut microbial colonization and involve innate immune signaling to the brain, mediated by CD11b+CD11c+CD103+ cell migration. The results identify a new target with therapeutic potential for DGBIs developing in context of increased gut and blood-brain barrier permeability.

Predictive processing theories posit that psychedelics work by loosening priors or high-level beliefs, including ingrained biases that have become pathological, leading to shifts in bottom-up vs top-down information processing that reconfigure perception, cognition, and mood. Because 5-HT2A receptors, the primary target of psychedelics, are enriched in visual cortices, we investigated whether psychedelics alter visual processing in a manner consistent with predictive processing theories. People who recently (<3 weeks) used 5-HT2A-agonist psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) exhibited slowed response latencies and increased cortical involvement in generating saccades to targets in predictable locations, along with a generalization of sensory prediction errors (i.e., deviance detection) during passive visual processing. Individuals who recently used a 5-HT1A-selective psychedelic (5-MeO-DMT) displayed similar changes in saccade production, but unaltered deviance detection, suggesting circuit-specific effects. Mice administered DOI (5-HT2A-agonist) exhibited altered deviance detection within primary visual cortex (V1), along with weakened top-down feedback to V1 from higher cortical area ACa.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, as in most flowering plants, the first zygotic cell division is asymmetric, giving rise to the embryo proper and an extraembryonic suspensor. Zygotic polarization and differential cell identities in the daughter cells are controlled by the ERECTA-YODA pathway, a prototype receptor kinase-MAP kinase signaling pathway. This pathway also controls asymmetric cell divisions in the epidermis during stomatal development. In this context, the bHLH transcription factor ICE1/SCRM is a direct target of MPK3/6, and phosphorylation negatively controls SCRM activity by targeting the protein for proteasomal degradation. This raises the question if this regulatory module is also involved in the asymmetric division of the zygote. Our results show that SCRM has a critical function in zygote polarization and acts in parallel with the known MPK3/6 target WRKY2 in activating the homeobox transcription factor gene WOX8. Our work further demonstrates that SCRM activity in the early embryo is positively controlled by MPK3/6-mediated phosphorylation. Therefore, the mode of MAP kinase regulation of the same target protein fundamentally differs between the embryo and the epidermis, shedding light on cell type-specific, differential gene regulation by common signaling pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Previous reports have identified mucus barrier deficiencies in adult germ-free mice, thus implicating a fundamental role for the microbiota in programming mucus barrier generation. In this study, we have investigated the natural neonatal development of the mucus barrier and sentinel goblet cell-dependent secretory responses upon postnatal colonization. Combined in vivo and ex vivo analyses of pre- and post-weaning colonic mucus barrier and sentinel goblet cell maturation demonstrated a sequential microbiota-dependent development of these primary and secondary goblet cell-intrinsic protective functions, with dynamic changes in mucus processing dependent on innate immune signalling via MyD88, and development of functional sentinel goblet cells dependent on the NADPH/Dual oxidase family member Duox2. Our findings therefore identify new mechanisms of microbiota-goblet cell regulatory interaction and highlight the critical importance of the pre-weaning period for the normal development of colonic barrier function.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570000

Genomic analysis can be used to trace transmission routes, supporting antimicrobial stewardship and informing infection control strategies. Here we used genomic analysis to track the movement and transmission of CREs within clinical and environmental samples. Methods: 25 isolates were cultured from clinical patient samples or swabs, that tested positive for OXA-48-like variants using the NG-Test CARBA-5 test and whole genome sequenced (WGS) using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). 158 swabs and 52 wastewater samples were collected from the ward environment. 60 isolates (matching clinical isolate genera; Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia) were isolated from the environmental samples. Metagenomic sequencing was undertaken on 36 environmental wastewater and swab samples. Results: 21/25 (84%) clinical isolates had >1 blaOXA gene and 19/25 (76%) harboured >1 blaNDM gene. Enterobacterales were most commonly isolated from environmental wastewater samples 27/52 (51.9%), then stick swabs 5/43 (11.6%) and sponge swabs 5/115 (4.3%). 11/60 (18%) environmental isolates harboured at >1 blaOXA gene and 1.9% (1/60) harboured blaNDM-1. blaOXA genes were found in 2/36 (5.5%) metagenomic environmental samples. Discussion: Potential for putative patient-patient and patient-ward transmission was shown. ONT sequencing can expedite clinical decisions whilst awaiting reference laboratory results, providing economic and patient care benefits. Metagenomic sampling needs optimization to improve sensitivity.","NA","medrxiv",1720303570000

Specific cellular-synaptic sources of inhibition in SPW-R remain unclear, as there are >60 types of GABAergic interneurons in CA1. Axo-axonic cells (AAC) are defined by their synaptic targeting of the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells, potently controlling spike output. The impact of AAC activity on SPW-R is controversial, due mainly to ambiguity of AAC identification. Here we monitored and manipulated opto-tagged AACs in behaving mice using silicon probe recordings. We found a large variability of AAC neurons, varying from enhanced to suppressed spiking during SPW-Rs, in contrast to the near-uniform excitation of other parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. AACs received convergent monosynaptic inputs from local pyramidal cell assemblies, which strongly influenced their participation in SPW-Rs. Optogenetic silencing of AACs increased power and duration of SPW-Rs, recruiting a greater number of PYR, suggesting AACs control SPW-R dynamics. We hypothesize that lateral inhibition by reciprocal PYR-AAC interactions thus supports the organization of cell assemblies in SPW-R.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Its activity is thus tightly controlled by a family of eukaryotic scaffolding proteins known as the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that confine PKA signaling to specific compartments in the cell. AKAP350 (the protein encoded by AKAP9) is a massive scaffolding protein that anchors PKA to the Golgi apparatus and the centrosome where it nucleates macromolecular signaling hubs that control microtubule nucleation and dynamics. Here, we have expressed and purified full-length AKAP350 from HEK293F cells in a functional conformation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) of the purified protein revealed polydisperse particles forming fibrillar clusters around 50 nm in diameter, and long, thin filaments that reconstructed into double-stranded DNA. Tomographic reconstruction of a tilt series of the purified protein by electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) further elucidated these fibrillar clusters as 3D bundles of entangled filaments. Mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing confirmed the co-purification of DNA and DNA binding proteins such as nuclear factor 1 B (NFIB) and nucleolin (NCL). Pulldown of NFIB and NCL, but not of CEP290, CDK5RAP2, and CEP170 was diminished in the presence of DNase-I, suggesting that AKAP350 interaction with these two proteins is mediated by DNA. Overall, this study has achieved a quality purification of AKAP350 from which a previously uncharacterized interaction landscape with DNA and DNA binding proteins was discovered.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Characterizing DAD pathophysiology across disease progression is of ultimate importance to better understand the molecular and cellular features driving different DAD patterns and to optimize treatment strategies. To contextualize the interplay between cell types and assess their distribution, spatial transcriptomics (ST) techniques have emerged allowing unprecedented resolution to investigate spatial architecture of tissues. To this end, post-mortem lung tissue provides valuable insights into cellular composition and their spatial relationships at the time of death. Here, we have leveraged VisumST technology in post-mortem COVID-19 induced acute and proliferative DAD lungs including control samples with normal morphological appearance to unravel the immunopathological mechanisms underlying DAD providing novel insights into cellular and molecular communication events driving DAD progression in fatal COVID-19. We report a progressive loss of endothelial cell types, pneumocytes type I and natural killer cells coupled with a continuous increase of myeloid and stromal cells, mostly peribronchial fibroblasts, over disease progression. Spatial organization analysis identified variable cellular compartments, ranging from major compartments defined by cell type lineages in control lungs to increased and more specific compartmentalization including immune-specific clusters across DAD spectrum. Importantly, spatially informed ligand-receptor interaction (LRI) analysis revealed an intercellular communication signature defining COVID-19 induced DAD lungs. Transcription factor (TF) activity enrichment analysis identified TGF-B pathway as DAD driver, highlighting SMAD3 and SMAD7 TFs activity role during lung fibrosis. Integration of deregulated LRIs and TFs activity, allowed us to propose a downstream intracellular signaling pathway in peribronchial fibroblasts, suggesting potential novel therapeutic targets. Finally, spatio-temporal trajectories analysis provided insights into the alveolar epithelium regeneration program, characterizing markers of pneumocytes type II differentiation towards pneumocytes type I. In conclusion, we provide a spatial characterization of lung tissue architecture upon COVID-19 induced DAD progression, identifying molecular and cellular hallmarks that may help optimize treatment and patient management.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Members of Brassicaceae family employ a ""lock and key"" mechanism involving stigmatic (sRALFs) and pollen RALFs (pRALFs) binding to FERONIA, a Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinase 1-like (CrRLK1L) receptor, to establish a prezygotic hybridization barrier. In the absence of compatible pRALFs, sRALFs bind to FERONIA, inducing a lock state for pollen tube penetration. Conversely, compatible pRALFs act as a key, facilitating successful fertilization. Competing pRALFs reduce the sRALFs binding to FERONIA in a dose-dependent manner, enabling pollen tube penetration. Despite its crucial role in Brassicaceae hybridization, the structural basis of this binding remains elusive owing to the highly flexible nature of RALF peptides. Using advanced structural modeling techniques and flexible peptide molecular docking, this study reveals that pRALFs and sRALFs bind to negatively charged pockets in FERONIA with varying binding affinities. Our study unveils the structural basis of this binding, shedding light on the molecular mechanism underlying hybridization barriers in Brassicaceae.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

We observed history-dependent spike back-propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes). Dendritic depolarization created a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation. Collisions of dSpikes with synaptic inputs triggered calcium channel and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials, with accompanying complex spikes at the soma.

However, the microbial communities associated within these stems (the  caulosphere) and their contribution to biogeochemical cycling of methane and other compounds remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal that specialised microbial communities inhabit the bark of multiple Australian tree species and actively mediate the cycling of methane, hydrogen, and other climate-active trace gases. Based on genome-resolved metagenomics, most bark-associated bacteria are hydrogen metabolisers and facultative fermenters, adapted to dynamic redox and substrate conditions. Over three quarters of assembled genomes encoded genes for hydrogen metabolism, including novel lineages of Acidobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota, and the candidate phylum JAJYCY01. Methanotrophs such as Methylomonas were abundant in certain trees and coexisted with hydrogenotrophic methanogenic Methanobacterium. Bark-associated microorganisms mediated aerobic oxidation of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane at concentrations seen in planta, but under anoxic conditions barks could become a significant source of these gases. Field-based experiments and upscaling analysis suggested that bark communities are quantitatively significant mediators of global biogeochemical cycling, mitigating climatically-active gas emissions from stems and contributing to the net terrestrial sink of atmospheric hydrogen. These findings highlight the caulosphere as an important new research frontier for understanding microbial gas cycling and biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Among the diverse proteins secreted by the nematode, we were specifically interested in identifying proteases to pursue our goal of engineering decoy substrates that elicit an immune response when cleaved by an SCN protease. We identified a cysteine protease that we named Cysteine Protease 1 (CPR1), which was predicted to be a secreted effector based on transcriptomic data obtained from SCN esophageal gland cells, presence of a signal peptide, and lack of transmembrane domains. CPR1 is conserved in all isolates of SCN sequenced to date, suggesting it is critical for virulence. Transient expression of CPR1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves suppressed cell death induced by a constitutively active nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat protein, RPS5, indicating that CPR1 inhibits effector-triggered immunity. CPR1 localizes in part to the mitochondria when expressed in planta. Proximity-based labeling in transgenic soybean roots, co-immunoprecipitation, and cleavage assays identified a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase from soybean (GmBCAT1) as a substrate of CPR1. Silencing of the CPR1 transcript in the nematode reduced penetration frequency in soybean roots while the expression of CPR1 in soybean roots enhanced susceptibility. Our data demonstrates that CPR1 is a conserved effector protease with a direct target in soybean roots, highlighting it as a promising candidate for decoy engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

ASL data from multiple vendors were included in the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. However, the M0 images were missing in Siemens ASL data, prohibiting CBF quantification. Here, we utilized a generative diffusion model to impute the missing M0 and validated generated CBF data with acquired data from GE.

MethodsA conditional latent diffusion model was trained to generate the M0 image and validate it on an in-house dataset (N=55) based on image similarity metrics, accuracy of CBF quantification, and consistency with the physical model. This model was then applied to the ADNI dataset (Siemens: N=211) to impute the missing M0 for CBF calculation. We further compared the imputed data (Siemens) and acquired data (GE) regarding regional CBF differences by AD stages, their classification accuracy for AD prediction, and CBF trajectory slopes estimated by a mixed effect model.

ResultsThe trained diffusion model generated the M0 image with high fidelity (Structural similarity index, SSIM=0.924{+/-}0.019; peak signal-to-noise ratio, PSNR=33.348{+/-}1.831) and caused minimal bias in CBF values (mean difference in whole brain is 1.07{+/-}2.12ml/100g/min). Both generated and acquired CBF data showed similar differentiation patterns by AD stages, similar classification performance, and decreasing slopes with AD progression in specific AD-related regions. Generated CBF data also improved accuracy in classifying AD stages compared to qualitative perfusion data.

In this manuscript, we use transgenic cilia reporter mice and an intravital imaging approach to quantitate primary cilia dynamics as it occurs in live mouse pancreatic islets. We validate this imaging workflow as suitable for studying islet cilia motion in real time in vivo and demonstrate that glucose stimulation corresponds to a change in cilia motility, which may be a physiologic measure of nutrient-dependent fluxes in islet cell function.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

The ECSA lineage dominated, causing significant outbreaks, especially in densely populated areas. The co-circulation of dengue and chikungunya has complicated diagnosis and treatment. The 2023 chikungunya epidemic in Minas Gerais, Southeast Brazil, prompted an assessment of associated mortality using WHO methodologies. Methods The study used epidemiological data from the laboratory surveillance, disease notification and mortality systems of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The North and Northeast Health Macroregions of Minas Gerais, with 2.5 million inhabitants, were analyzed. A Poisson regression model, excluding critical periods of COVID-19 and the chikungunya epidemic, estimated expected mortality. Excess deaths were calculated by comparing observed deaths with model estimates during the epidemic period. Results During the epidemic, there were 890 excess deaths attributed to chikungunya, translating into a mortality rate of 35.1/100,000 inhabitants. The excess mortality rate was significantly 60 times higher than the deaths reported by surveillance, with only 15 deaths confirmed. The correlation between excess deaths and laboratory-confirmed chikungunya cases was strong, while the correlation with dengue and COVID-19 was negligible. The results highlighted the serious underestimation of chikungunya mortality by epidemiological surveillance. Discussion We estimate that there were 890 excess deaths in the 2023 chikungunya epidemic in just one affected area of Minas Gerais, Brazil (2.5 million inhabitants). During the same year, only 420 chikungunya deaths were reported by all PAHO member countries. Epidemiological surveillance has underestimated the impact of this disease. Excess mortality is a crucial measure for understanding the impact of epidemics, as demonstrated by COVID-19 and influenza pandemics. The study highlights the need for complementary tools to traditional surveillance to better assess impacts on morbidity and mortality. Underreporting of chikungunya deaths has significant implications for public health responses and resource allocation. This study supports the importance of accurately quantifying mortality from emerging viruses to inform risk assessments and priority setting in public health interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1720303570001

Although many competitive interactions have been characterized, molecular adaptations that can counter this antagonism and preserve or increase fitness remain underexplored. Here, we characterize the adaptation of Staphylococcus aureus to pyocyanin, a redox-active interspecies antimicrobial produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a co-infecting pathogen frequently isolated from wound and chronic lung infections with S. aureus. Using experimental evolution, we identified mutations in a conserved global transcriptional regulator, CodY, that confer tolerance to pyocyanin and thereby enhance survival of S. aureus. The transcriptional response of a pyocyanin tolerant CodY mutant to pyocyanin indicated a two-pronged defensive response compared to the wild type. Firstly, the CodY mutant strongly suppressed metabolism, by downregulating pathways associated with core metabolism, especially translation-associated genes, upon exposure to pyocyanin. Metabolic suppression via ATP depletion was sufficient to provide comparable protection against pyocyanin to the wild-type strain. Secondly, while both the wild-type and CodY mutant strains upregulated oxidative stress response pathways, the CodY mutant overexpressed multiple stress response genes compared to the wild type. We determined that catalase overexpression was critical to pyocyanin tolerance as its absence eliminated tolerance in the CodY mutant and overexpression of catalase was sufficient to impart tolerance to the wild-type strain. Together, these results suggest that both transcriptional responses likely contribute to pyocyanin tolerance in the CodY mutant. Our data thus provide new mechanistic insight into adaptation toward interbacterial antagonism via altered regulation that facilitates multifaceted protective cellular responses.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

A conserved region (CR, spanning residues 319-341) in CTD forms transient helix-helix contacts important for its higher-order oligomerization and function that are disrupted by ALS-associated mutations. However, the structural details of CR assembly and the explanation for several ALS-associated variants' impact on phase separation and function remain unclear due to challenges in analyzing the dynamic association of TDP-43 CTD using traditional structural biology approaches. By employing an integrative approach, combining biophysical experiments, biochemical assays, AlphaFold2-Multimer (AF2-Multimer), and atomistic simulations, we generated structural models of helical oligomerization of TDP-43 CR. Using NMR, we first established that the native state of TDP-43 CR under physiological conditions is -helical. Next, alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that while hydrophobic residues in the CR are important for CR assembly, phase separation and TDP-43 nuclear retention function, polar residues down regulate these processes. Finally, pairing AF2-Multimer modeling with AAMD simulations indicated that dynamic, oligomeric assemblies of TDP-43 that are stabilized by a methionine-rich core with specific contributions from a tryptophan/leucine pair. In conclusion, our results advance the structural understanding of the mechanisms driving TDP-43 function and provide a window into the initial stages of its conversion into pathogenic aggregates.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

N-myristoyltransferases (NMT) are essential enzymes for protein N-myristoylation, affecting stability, interaction, localization, and function of numerous proteins. We demonstrate that selective inhibition of host cell NMT decreases SARS-CoV-2 infection by 90% in human lung and primary nasal epithelial cells, and choroid plexus-cortical neuron organoids. NMT inhibition does not affect viral entry, replication or release, but impairs the maturation and incorporation of viral envelope proteins into newly assembled virions, leading to compromised infectivity of released virions. The inhibition of host NMT triggers a Golgi-bypassing pathway for SARS-CoV-2 progeny virion egress, which occurs through endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomal intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

TEs were previously thought to have little functional relevance but recent studies have reported TE roles in multiple biological processes, particularly in embryonic development. To investigate the expression dynamics of TEs during human early development, we used long-read sequence data generated from in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm lineages to construct lineage-specific transcriptome assemblies and accurately place TE sequences in their transcript context. Our analysis revealed that specific TE types, such as LINEs and LTRs, exhibit distinct expression patterns across different lineages. Notably, an expression outburst was observed in the ectoderm lineage, with multiple TE types showing dynamic expression trajectories. Additionally, certain LTRs, including HERVH and LTR7Y, were highly expressed in hPSCs and endodermal cells, but these HERVH and LTR7Y sequences originated from completely different transcripts. Interestingly, TE-containing transcripts exhibit distinct levels of transcript stability and subcellular localization across different lineages. Moreover, we showed a consistent trend of increased chromatin association of TE-containing transcripts in germ lineage cells compared to hPSCs. This study suggests that TEs contribute to human embryonic development through dynamic chromatin interaction.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Although such genomic differences are thought to make key contributions to distinctly modern human traits, experimental validation of their potential impact was so far restricted to functional assays and model organisms. With the availability of large-scale genetically informative population databases, it now becomes possible to identify present-day carriers of rare archaic alleles of interest and to directly assess putative phenotypic consequences in living humans. We queried exome sequencing data of around half a million people in the UK Biobank in search of carriers of archaic alleles at 37 genomic positions with supposedly fixed human-specific changes. This search yielded 103 carriers of the archaic allele for 17 positions, with diverging allele counts across ancestries. We contrasted carriers of an exemplary archaic allele in SSH2 with a curated set of non-carriers, observing no deviation from the norm in a range of health, psychological, and cognitive traits. We also identified 62 carriers of the archaic allele of a missense change in the TKTL1 gene, previously reported to have large effects on cortical neurogenesis based on functional analyses in brain organoids and animal models. However, human carriers of the archaic TKTL1 allele did not show differences in anatomical brain measures and qualification level, compared to non-carriers. These results highlight the importance of investigating diverse ancestral populations for a more accurate representation of shared human variation and challenge the notion of permanently fixed genetic changes that set Homo sapiens apart from Neandertals and Denisovans. Lastly, we propose that future investigations should assess effects of multiple archaic alleles in aggregate, since any single genetic change is unlikely to itself explain the emergence of complex human traits.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Mobile Integrons (MI) are borne on plasmids, acting as a vehicle for hundreds of antimicrobial resistance genes among key pathogens. These elements also carry gene cassettes of unknown function (gcus) whose role and adaptive value remains unexplored. Recent years have witnessed the discovery of a myriad defence systems against bacteriophages, highlighting that viral infection is a major selective pressure for bacteria. We hence sought to explore if gcus could encode phage defence systems. Using the INTEGRALL database, we established a collection of 129 gcus in pMBA, a vector where cassettes are established as part of a class 1 integron. PADLOC and DefenseFinder predicted four phage defence systems in this collection, comprising Lamassu, CBASS and two ABI (abortive infection) systems. We experimentally challenged all cassettes with phages and found nine additional candidates that were not detected in silico. We have characterized in depth the 13 gcus against a panel of phages in Escherichia coli confirming their role as phage defence integron cassettes (PICs). We used recombination assays to verify that all systems are bona fide integron cassettes and are therefore mobile. We show that PICs confer resistance in other clinically relevant species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several PICs also limit prophage activation, providing protection at the population-level. Given the stockpiling capacity of integrons, we explored the additivity of phenotypes and found that integrons with two PICs confer multiphage-resistance. Additionally, when combined with antimicrobial resistance genes, integrons confer simultaneously drug and phage resistance. Crucially, we also show that the position of a pic in the array can strongly decrease its cost. Our results prove a role of integrons in phage defence, acting as highly mobile, low-cost defence islands. This has important implications in the spread of defence systems, and on the future of phage therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Given that whole-body regeneration shares the same end-point - formation of a functional body plan - as embryonic development, it has been proposed that regeneration likely recapitulates developmental processes to some extent. Therefore, understanding how developmental processes are reactivated during regeneration is important for uncovering the evolutionary history of regeneration. Comparative transcriptomic studies in some species have revealed shared gene expression between development and regeneration, but it is not known whether these shared expression profiles correspond to shared functions, and which mechanisms activate expression of developmental genes during regeneration. We sought to address these questions using the acoel Hofstenia miamia, which is amenable to studies of both embryonic development and whole-body regeneration. By examining functionally validated regeneration processes during development at single-cell resolution, we found that whereas patterning and cellular differentiation are largely similar, wound response programs have distinct dynamics between development and regeneration. Chromatin accessibility analyses revealed that regardless of playing concordant or divergent roles during regeneration and development, genes expressed in both processes are frequently controlled by the same regulatory regions, potentially via utilization of distinct transcription factor binding sites. This study extends the known correspondence of development and regeneration from broad transcriptomic similarity to include patterning and differentiation processes. Further, our work provides a catalog of regulatory regions and binding sites that potentially regulate developmental genes during regeneration, fueling comparative studies of regeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

We examined 318 Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) accessions for evidence of introgression from cultivated barley. Using SNP genotype and exome capture data, we performed local ancestry inference between the 318 WBDC accessions and cultivated barley to identify genomic regions with evidence of introgression. Using the genomic intervals for well-characterized genes involved in domestication and improvement, we examined the evidence for introgression at genomic regions potentially important for maintaining a wild phenotype. Our analysis revealed that nearly 16% (48 of 318) of WBDC accessions showed evidence of introgression from cultivated barley, and up to 16.6% of the genome has been introgressed. All accessions identified as introgressed based on domestication-related phenotypes show clear genetic evidence of introgression. The size of runs of identity by state and local ancestry inference suggests that most introgression did not occur recently. This study suggests a long history of genetic exchange between wild and cultivated barley, highlighting the potential for introgression to influence the genetic makeup and future adaptation of wild populations, with implications for plant conservation strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study.

Methods: We analysed cohorts of population-wide registries of young individuals from Norway (N=1,986,970) and Sweden (N=2,100,188). We used regression models to estimate adjusted rate ratios (aRR), treating exposures as time-varying, starting 30 days after registered SARS-CoV-2 positive test or vaccination. Results: Pooled results from Norway and Sweden and age-groups 12-17 and 18-29 years showed no significant increase in type 1 diabetes after documented infections (aRR 1.06, 95%CI:0.77-1.45). There was moderate heterogeneity, with a suggestive increased risk among children in Norway after infection. Pooled results for Norway and Sweden and age-groups 12-17 years and 18-29 years showed no significant association between SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and risk of type 1 diabetes (aRR 1.09, 95%CI: 0.81, 1.48). There was significant heterogeneity, primarily driven by a positive association among children and an inverse association in young adults in Sweden. While the type 1 diabetes incidence increased and diabetes ketoacidosis decreased over time during 2016-2023, no significant break in time-trends were seen after March 2020 for HbA1c, risk or severity of diabetic ketoacidosis, or islet autoantibodies, at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Conclusion: Taken together, these results do not indicate any consistent, large effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection or -vaccination on risk of type 1 diabetes or severity at disease onset. Suggestive associations in sub-groups should be investigated further in other studies.","NA","medrxiv",1720303570001

In principle, multiple gene targets can be regulated independently by choosing orthogonal scaffold RNA (scRNA); in practice, this is not the case due to competition for dCas9 and activator protein. While prior studies have extensively characterized competition effects in CRISPRi circuits such an investigation in CRISPRa circuits is still lacking. In this paper, we investigate the on-target and off-target effects of competition for the two resources during CRISPRa. We observe a biphasic response in the on-target response of a CRISPRa module, wherein increased expression of scRNA leads to target repression instead of activation. The addition of a competitor further leads to the repression of any other CRISPRa system, showing the lack of modularity of concurrent CRISPRa systems. These effects are significant even when both resources are expressed at their maximum tolerable limit. We finally show that competition can also be used to design the response of a CRISPRa module by reducing leakiness while keeping the same maximal activation. The results from this study can significantly affect the interpretation of data obtained when using multiple CRISPRi/a modules and can be used as a predictive tool to determine how the operation of any such module in a concurrent configuration is different from the one expected in isolation.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

NLR homeostasis has to be tightly regulated to ensure proper defense without triggering autoimmunity. However, in contrast to singleton NLRs, the mechanisms controlling the paired NLRs complex homeostasis are less understood. The paired Arabidopsis RRS1/RPS4 immune receptor complex confers disease resistance through effector recognition mediated by the integrated WRKY domain of RRS1. Here, through proximity labelling, we reveal a ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle that controls the homeostasis of the RRS1/RPS4 complex. E3 ligase RARE directly binds and ubiquitinates RRS1s WRKY domain to promote its proteasomal degradation, thereby destabilizing RPS4 indirectly and compromising the stability and function of the RRS1/RPS4 complex. Conversely, the deubiquitinating enzymes UBP12/UBP13 deubiquitinate RRS1s WRKY domain, counteracting RAREs effects. Interestingly, the abundance of WRKY transcription factors WRKY70 and WRKY41 is also regulated by RARE and UBP12/UBP13. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this regulation likely transferred from WRKY70/WRKY41 to RRS1 upon WRKY domain integration. Our findings improve our understanding of homeostatic regulation of paired NLR complex and uncover a new paradigm whereby domain integration can co-opt preexisting post-translational modification to regulate novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Here, we present the landscape of protein synthesis inside human cells in unprecedented detail obtained using an approach which combines automated cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling and in situ single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). With this in situ cryo-EM approach we resolved a 2.19 [A] consensus structure of the human 80S ribosome and unveiled its 21 distinct functional states, nearly all higher than 3 [A] resolution. In contrast to in vitro studies, we identified protein factors, including SERBP1, EDF1 and NAC not enriched on purified ribosomes. Most strikingly, we observed that SERBP1 binds to the ribosome in almost all translating and non-translating states to bridge the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits. These newly observed binding sites suggest that SERBP1 may serve an important regulatory role in translation. We also uncovered a detailed interface between adjacent translating ribosomes which can form the helical polysome structure. Finally, we resolved high-resolution structures from cells treated with homoharringtonine and cycloheximide, and identified numerous polyamines bound to the ribosome, including a spermidine that interacts with cycloheximide bound at the E site of the ribosome, underscoring the importance of high-resolution in situ studies in the complex native environment.

Here, we investigate the developing connectome of C. elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally-observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Validation of our models predictions of the synaptic connections using multiple reconstructions of adult worms suggests that our model identified the fundamental ""backbone"" of the connectivity graph. The accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

To tackle this, we developed mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)-based heterogeneous cultures and a limb organoid model, termed budoids, comprising cells with AER, surface ectoderm, and mesoderm properties. mESCs were first induced into heterogeneous cultures that self-organized into domes in 2D. Aggregating these cultures resulted in formation of limb bud-like structures in 3D, exhibiting chondrogenesis-based symmetry breaking and elongation. Using our organoids and quantitative in situ expression profiling, we uncovered that AER-like cells support nearby limb mesoderm and fibroblast identities while enhancing tissue polarization that permits distant cartilage formation.

This deep homology is reflected in ESCRT-III structure and function as demonstrated by the fact that ESCRT-IIIB assembles into parallel arrays on planar membranes to initiate membrane deformation, and is required to recruit ESCRT-IIIA to generate composite polymers. ESCRT-IIIA homopolymers can then remodel membranes into tubes, as a likely prelude to scission. Taken together, this analysis reveals a set of conserved principles governing ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodelling that first emerged with the evolution of a two-component ESCRT-III system in the Asgard archaea, and which continue to underlie complex multi-component, ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodelling in eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.

MethodsSurveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.

ResultsThe Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.

ConclusionsUrgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak.","10.1038/s41591-024-03130-3","medrxiv",1720303570001

One approach to identifying functional areas and networks within individual brains is based on robust and extensively validated  localizer paradigms--contrasts of conditions that aim to isolate some mental process of interest. Here, we present a new version of a localizer for the fronto-temporal language-selective network. This localizer is similar to a commonly-used localizer based on the reading of sentences and nonword sequences (Fedorenko et al., 2010) but uses speeded presentation (200ms per word/nonword). Based on a direct comparison between the standard version (450ms per word/nonword) and the speeded versions of the language localizer in 24 participants, we show that a single run of the speeded localizer (3.5 min) is highly effective at identifying the language-selective areas: indeed, it is more effective than the standard localizer given that it leads to an increased response to the critical (sentence) condition and a decreased response to the control (nonwords) condition. This localizer may therefore become the version of choice for identifying the language network in neurotypical adults or special populations (as long as they are proficient readers), especially when time is of essence.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Novel approaches to control the spread of arboviruses focus on harnessing the antiviral immune system of their primary vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In arthropods, genes of the Vago family are often presented as analogs of mammalian cytokines with potential antiviral functions, but the role of Vago genes upon virus infection in Ae. aegypti is largely unknown. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the Vago gene family in Diptera, which led us to focus on a Vago-like gene that we named VLG-1. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated a VLG-1 mutant line of Ae. aegypti that revealed a proviral effect of this gene upon DENV and ZIKV infection. In the absence of VLG-1, virus dissemination throughout the mosquitos body was impaired, albeit not altering virus transmission rates. A tissue-specific transcriptome analysis revealed that the loss of VLG-1 impacted numerous biological processes potentially linked to viral replication, such as the oxidative stress response. Our results challenge the conventional understanding of Vago-like genes as antiviral factors and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying mosquito-arbovirus interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

The apoptosome is crucial for mitochondrial apoptosis, as it activates caspases that dismantle the cell. However, the assembly mechanism and appearance of the apoptosome in vivo remain unclear. We show that upon onset of apoptosis, Apaf1 molecules accumulate into multiple foci per cell. Disassembly of the foci is linked to survival of the cell. Structurally, Apaf1 foci resemble organelle-sized, cloud-like assemblies. Foci form upon specific molecular interactions with cytochrome c and depending on procaspase-9. We propose that Apaf1 foci correspond to the apoptosome in cells. Transientness and ultrastructure of Apaf1 foci suggest that the dynamic spatiotemporal organisation of apoptosome components regulates progression of apoptosis.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Thus far, most single-cell studies in plant systems have been limited to RNA-sequencing approaches, which only provide indirect readouts of cellular functions. Here, we present a single-cell proteomics workflow for plant cells that integrates tape-sandwich protoplasting, piezoelectric cell sorting, nanoPOTS sample preparation, and FAIMS-based MS data acquisition method for label-free single-cell proteomics analysis of Arabidopsis leaf mesophyll cells. From a single leaf protoplast, over 3,000 proteins were quantified with high precision. The workflow is demonstrated to identify stress associated changes in protein abundance by analyzing >80 protoplasts from well-watered and water-deficit stressed plants. Additionally, we describe a new approach for constructing covarying protein networks at the single-cell level and demonstrate how single-cell protein covariation analysis can reveal previously unrecognized protein functions while also capturing stress-induced changes in protein-protein dynamics.

While Spanish colonists brought horses to the Caribbean and southern latitudes earlier, the transport of domestic horses to the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia in 1606 was among the first dispersals to the eastern seaboard. Archaeozoological analysis, isotope analysis, and radiocarbon dating of identifiable domestic equid remains from two contexts associated with the initial occupation of Jamestown demonstrate intense processing and consumption of the first Jamestown horses during the ""Starving Time"" winter of 1609, while paleopathological data show evidence of their use in transport. Osteological, genetic, and isotopic study of these equid remains reveal the presence of at least one adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a trans-Atlantic stopover. These results reveal the importance of equids in the survival of early European settlers and the global connectivity of early trans-Atlantic exchange in horses and donkeys, showing Caribbean and African links in the founding livestock populations and pointing towards an important and ecologically-anchored role for donkeys in the early colonial lifeways along the Eastern seaboard.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

A central question in bacterial ecology is why some species engage in cooperative interactions, whereas others compete. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By scanning thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions to the availability of environmental resources.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

Condensates can be two- or multi-phase systems defined by coexisting dense and dilute phases. Here, we show that solution ions can partition asymmetrically across coexisting phases defined by condensates formed by intrinsically disordered proteins or homopolymeric RNA molecules. Our findings were enabled by direct measurements of the activities of cations and anions within coexisting phases of protein and RNA condensates. Asymmetries in ion partitioning between coexisting phases vary with protein sequence, condensate type, salt concentration, and ion type. The Donnan equilibrium set up by asymmetrical partitioning of solution ions generates interphase electric potentials known as Donnan and Nernst potentials. Our measurements show that the interphase potentials of condensates are of the same order of magnitude as membrane potentials of membrane-bound organelles. Interphase potentials quantify the degree to which microenvironments of coexisting phases are different from one another. Importantly, and based on condensate-specific interphase electric potentials, which are membrane-like potentials of membraneless bodies, we reason that condensates are mesoscale capacitors that store charge. Interphase potentials lead to electric double layers at condensate interfaces. This helps explain recent observations of condensate interfaces being electrochemically active.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

During aging, alterations in lipid metabolism lead to reduced content of very long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, and this decline is associated with normal age-related visual decline and pathological age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ELOVL2 (Elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids-like 2) encodes a transmembrane protein that produces precursors to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and VLC-PUFAs, and methylation level of its promoter is currently the best predictor of chronological age. Here, we show that mice lacking ELOVL2-specific enzymatic activity (Elovl2C234W) have impaired contrast sensitivity and slower rod response recovery following bright light exposure. Intravitreal supplementation with the direct product of ELOVL2, 24:5n-3, in aged animals significantly improved visual function and reduced accumulation of ApoE, HTRA1 and complement proteins in sub-RPE deposits. At the molecular level, the gene expression pattern observed in retinas supplemented with 24:5n-3 exhibited a partial rejuvenation profile, including decreased expression of aging-related genes and a transcriptomic signature of younger retina. Finally, we present the first human genetic data showing significant association of several variants in the human ELOVL2 locus with the onset of intermediate AMD, underlying the translational significance of our findings. In sum, our study identifies novel therapeutic opportunities and defines ELOVL2 as a promising target for interventions aimed at preventing age-related vision loss.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570001

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570002

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570002

Consistent with its extensive binding epitope, 1301B7 is able to potently diminish viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract and protect mice from challenge with Omicron XBB1.5 and Omicron JN.1 viruses. These results suggest 1301B7 has broad potential to prevent or treat clinical SARS-CoV-2 infections and to guide development of RBD-based universal SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic approaches.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570002

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720303570002

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720303570002

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
