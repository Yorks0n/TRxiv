The underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, and diagnostic markers and effective treatments are presently lacking. We performed aptamer-based serum proteomics in 54 ME/CFS patients and 27 healthy controls and identified 1823 of 7326 aptamers reporting differences between the groups (845 after false discovery rate (FDR) correction). Distinct patterns of tissue- and process-specific changes were seen. There was a broad increase in secreted proteins, while intracellular proteins, e.g. from skeletal muscle, particularly showed reduction. Immune cell-specific signatures indicated immune reprogramming, including a distinct reduction in neutrophil-associated proteins. Focused secretome analysis supported intensified regulatory interactions related to immune activity, inflammation, vasculature, and metabolism. Validation of measurements using antibody-based methods confirmed findings for a selection of proteins. The uncovered serum proteome patterns in ME/CFS patients help clarify a multifaceted pathophysiology and offer a foundation for future therapy and biomarker discovery efforts.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

Along with laboratory characterisation and electron microscopy, we generated a complete Noodlococcus genome sequence using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore data. The genome consisted of a single, circular, 2,732,108 bp chromosome that shared 97.5% Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) with the Kocuria rhizophila type strain TA68. We identified genomic features involved in replication (oriC), carotenoid synthesis (crt), and genome defence (CRISPR-Cas), and discovered four novel mobile elements (ISKrh4-7). Despite its environmental ubiquity and relevance to food production, bioremediation, and human medicine, there have been few genomic studies of the Kocuria genus. We conducted a comparative, phylogenetic, and pangenomic examination of all 257 publicly available Kocuria genomes, with a particular focus on the 56 that were identified as K. rhizophila. We found that there are two phylogenetically distinct clades of K. rhizophila, with within-clade ANI values of 96.7-100.0% and between-clade values of 89.5-90.4%. The second clade, which we refer to as K. pseudorhizophila, exhibited ANI values of <95% relative to TA68 and constitutes a separate species. Delineation of the two clades would be consistent with the rest of the genus, where all other species satisfy the 95% ANI threshold criteria. Differences in the K. rhizophila and K. pseudorhizophila pangenomes likely reflect phenotypic as well as evolutionary divergence. This distinction is relevant to clinical and industrial settings, as strains and genomes from both clades are currently used interchangeably, which may lead to reproducibility issues and phenotype-genotype discordance. Investigating an innocuous laboratory contaminant has therefore provided useful insights into the understudied species K. rhizophila, prompting an unexpected reassessment of its taxonomy.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Much effort has been devoted to understanding TF activity in different tissues and how tissue-specificity is achieved. However, ultimately gene regulation occurs at the single cell level and the recent explosion in the availability of single cell gene expression data now makes it possible to understand TF activity at this granular level of resolution. Here, we leverage a large collection of Human Cell Atlas (HCA) single cell data to explore TF activity by examining cell-type and tissue-specific sets of target genes, or regulons. We compile a regulon atlas, CellRegulon, and map the activity of TFs in an extensive set of healthy adult and foetal tissues spanning hundreds of cell types. Using CellRegulon, we describe dynamic patterns of co-regulation, associate TF-modules with different cellular functions and characterise the distribution of active TFs and TF families across cell types. We show that CellRegulon can link disease gene expression signatures to cell types and TFs relevant to the disease. Finally, using a newly generated multiome dataset of the adult lung, we show how CellRegulon can be extended into an enhancer-gene regulatory network (eGRN) to improve cell-type associations with genetic risk loci for diseases, such as childhood onset asthma, COPD and IPF, and to identify high risk gene modules. Our database for easy download and interactive exploration allows researchers to understand key gene modules activated at cell type transitions and will therefore be valuable for tasks such as cell type engineering (https://www.cellregulondb.org).","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Receptor switches are key to the integration of environmental signals, yet it is not well understood how their signal processing is genetically encoded. Here, to address these questions, we present a complete map of how mutations quantitatively alter the input-output function of a receptor. Using a massively parallel approach, GluePCA, we quantify more than 40,000 binding measurements and 3,500 dose-response curves for variants of the allosteric phytohormone receptor PYL1. Strikingly, >91% of missense variants tune the dose-response of the receptor. Many variants drive changes in sensitivity, basal activity, maximum response and induction steepness in a correlated manner, suggesting a shared underlying biophysical mechanism, which we identify as stability changes. Beyond this, signalling parameters can be independently tuned by mutations, with surprisingly large effects in interface-distal positions and a modular genetic architecture across the receptors structure. A small subset of missense variants confers qualitative phenotypic innovation, producing hypersensitive and inverted response patterns. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of dose-response profile quantification at massive scale and reveal the remarkable evolutionary malleability of an allosteric switch.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

To address this, we developed MIC-Drop-seq, which combines high-throughput CRISPR gene disruption in zebrafish embryos with phenotyping by multiplexed single-cell RNAseq. In one MIC-Drop-seq experiment, we simultaneously identified changes in gene expression and cell abundance across 74 cell types resulting from loss of function of 50 transcription factors. These observations recapitulated many known phenotypes, while also uncovering novel functions in brain and mesoderm development. A key advantage of whole-animal screens is that they reveal how changes in one cell type affect the development of other cell types. Surprisingly, such cell-extrinsic phenotypes were abundant, indicating that transcription factors frequently exert effects beyond the cells where they are expressed to adjacent cells. We propose that MIC-Drop-seq will facilitate efforts to dissect the complete gene regulatory networks that guide animal development.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

In angiosperms, a double fertilization process results in the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm, both of which develop within maternal sporophytic integuments. Thus, the seed of angiosperms is a combined structure of three genetically distinct components: embryo, endosperm, and maternal integuments. It has long been assumed that the maternal plant influences embryo development, but there is limited molecular evidence for a direct pathway through which the maternal sporophyte affects embryogenesis. Here we show that secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated upon exosome impairment lead to embryo abortion through a maternal sporophytic effect. Depletion of the core subunit of the RNA-processing exosome RRP45B (CER7) causes globular embryo arrest connected to ectopic post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Seed coat expression of CER7 suppresses seed abortion, demonstrating a maternal sporophytic control of embryo development through an RNA decay safeguard pathway. Our data support a model in which a primary siRNA trigger originates in the maternal integuments of the cer7 seed coat and drives PTGS amplification in reproductive tissues after fertilization, ultimately leading to seed abortion. In addition, our genetic and molecular data suggest that overloading of AGO1 with siRNAs impairs miRNA function, likely leading to embryo arrest. Our data highlight the complex interplay between maternal and embryonic gene regulation, reinforcing the importance of controlled RNA decay in plant development.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Here, using longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) on islets from C57BL/6 mice subjected to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 8, 16, and 24 weeks, along with age-matched controls on regular chow, we mapped dynamic changes in islet cell composition and transcriptional states. Beta cells demonstrated pronounced stress-induced reprogramming, with the emergence of proliferative and dysfunctional subsets. Alpha and delta cell fractions declined under HFD, despite increased polyhormonal biosynthesis, suggesting functional rather than numerical adaptation. Immune profiling showed robust expansion of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and upregulation of NF-{kappa}B and chemotaxis pathways, particularly at 16 weeks. Notably, cell-cell communication analyses revealed diet-specific disruption in signaling networks. Under HFD conditions, intercellular communication among beta cells, macrophages, and delta cells was markedly altered, leading to the disruption of key signaling pathways such as the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). Notably, C-C motif chemokine ligand 27A (Ccl27a) expression and chromatin accessibility were significantly altered in a distinct subpopulation of beta cells under HFD condition, indicative of a niche-specific regulatory mechanism. Integration with human islet datasets from obese and type 2 diabetes (T2D) donors confirmed conserved shifts in beta cell identity and immune activation.

These adaptations include genome sequence optimizations, such as increased GC content in rRNA and tRNA, shifts in codon and amino acids usage, and the acquisition of functional genes conferring adaptation for specific temperatures. Since the experimental determination of optimal growth temperatures (OGT) is only possible for cultured species, predicting OGT from genomic information has become increasingly important given the exponential increase in genomic data. Although previous studies developed prediction models integrating multiple features based on genome composition using machine learning, the accuracy was variable depending on the target species, with models performing well for thermophiles but less accurately for psychrophiles. In this study, we curated the OGT and genomic data of 2,869 bacterial species to develop a novel prediction model incorporating features reflecting genomic adaptation toward lower temperatures. We found that species with rapid OGT shifts from their ancestors, including psychrophiles, showed less accuracy in genome composition-based models. Incorporating the gene presence/absence information associated with the rapid changes in OGT improved the prediction accuracy for psychrophiles. We also observed that OGT in archaea is phylogenetically more conserved than in bacteria, which may lead to the long-term optimization of the genome composition and explain high predictability of OGT in archaea. These findings highlight the importance of integrating long- and short-term evolutionary adaptations for phenotype prediction models.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

We demonstrate that DGCR8 restricts the accumulation of endogenous dsRNA originating from protein-coding mRNAs that harbour transposable elements (TEs), primarily Alu. We propose that DGCR8 binding to TE-rich mRNAs is essential to resolve dsRNA structures, and in its absence, accumulated dsRNA signals through the RIG-I-like signalling pathway triggering the IFN response. This mechanism is relevant to conditions where DGCR8 expression levels are altered, including the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS). Supporting this, we show that 22qDS-derived cells exhibit an exacerbated type I IFN response which inversely correlated with DGCR8 levels. All these together demonstrate the importance of suppressing endogenous TE-dsRNA accumulation to prevent unwanted immune activation and associated disease pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Here, we show that the histone variant H2A.Z is a novel sex-specific regulator of AD in human patients and AD model mice. Specifically, H2A.Z binding in chromatin declines in female and increases in male AD patients, indicating opposite patterns of AD-related H2A.Z dysregulation in each sex. These sex differences were recapitulated in the 5xFAD model of AD, in which females accumulated H2A.Z at early disease stages and lost H2A.Z as the disease progressed, suggesting that H2A.Z occupancy shifts with advancing disease. Males showed no change in H2A.Z binding in early disease, but exhibited increased binding as disease progressed, albeit to a lesser extent than females. Consistent with sex-specific H2A.Z dysregulation, H2A.Z depletion produced sex-specific changes in gene expression, whereby H2A.Z was more repressive in female than male mice and in 5xFAD than in WT males, suggesting that H2A.Z's role in transcription is altered with disease state. Moreover, H2A.Z depletion improved memory and AD pathology in females, while impairing memory and worsening pathology in male mice. Together, these data suggest that H2A.Z is protective in males and detrimental in females with AD, with key implications for sex-specific therapeutic targeting of chromatin factors.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

However, this hypothesis is challenged by a temporal disconnect, spanning several hundred million years, between the earliest geochemical evidence for oxygen in the environment ([~]3.2-2.5 Ga) and the oldest widely accepted eukaryotic fossils ([~]1.7 Ga).

Here, we integrate Proterozoic surface geochemical records with the microbial biochemistry of iron to examine potential environmental constraints on early eukaryotic evolution. Iron bioavailability exerts complex and often antagonistic effects on both aerobic and anaerobic microbial lineages that contributed to LECA. Elevated iron levels likely disrupted cellular homeostasis, particularly by destabilizing labile iron pools and promoting oxidative damage to bacterial lipids. The programmed cell death pathways known as ferroptosis, which is widespread among eukaryotic lineages, may trace its origins to iron-rich conditions in Archaean and Paleoproterozoic seawater and LECA. Our findings challenge oxygen-centered paradigms of eukaryogenesis and reframes the long-recognized temporal gap as a consequence of iron-mediated physiological constraints.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

However, there is a growing list of species in which parts of the genome are removed from some cells of the organism through a process called programmed DNA elimination. In songbirds, an entire chromosome, called the germline-restricted chromosome (GRC), is lost from all somatic cells during early embryonic development. Nevertheless, the mechanisms, timing and consequences of this elimination remain largely unexplored. Here, we studied GRC elimination using two songbird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and the Bengalese finch (Lonchura domestica), as model systems. We found that chromosome elimination occurs during the cleavage stage and is completed before egg laying and blastoderm formation. Elimination is associated with delayed attachment of the GRC to the mitotic spindle, changes in its histone modifications, and failure of chromatid separation in anaphase. The lagging GRC is then sequestered into a micronucleus with a defective envelope lacking the essential protein lamin B1, where the DNA is fragmented and degraded. Although the genetic basis of GRC elimination remains to be elucidated, our results suggest that changes of the GRC centromere together with epigenetic modifications of histones play a crucial role in GRC elimination from somatic cells. As the timing of elimination coincides with the germline/soma distinction, we propose that GRC elimination may play an important role in this crucial developmental process in songbirds.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Here, combining in vitro reconstitution, cell biology, and simulations, we show that membranous interfaces promote -Synuclein condensation at physiologically relevant sub-critical concentrations (~10 nM) without crowding agents. Notably, condensation occurs only on membranes with a specific stoichiometry of lipids, underscoring the role of interfacial potential. These condensates serve as nucleation sites for fibril formation, leading to membrane deformation and rupture. A lattice gas model reveals this behavior as a prewetting-like transition, where an attractive membrane induces local phase separation below the bulk saturation concentration. Indeed, altering interfacial potential by lipid composition and membrane depolarization not only drastically changes -Synuclein puncta size and number but also triggers their release from neurons. These findings reveal the crucial role of lipid membrane interfaces in regulating -Synuclein condensation, aggregation, and release, shedding light on a potential mechanism of their cell-to-cell propagation during neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gi{beta}{gamma} heterotrimer by the -opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptors transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a  kinetic trap during G-protein activation.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Here, we show that efficient folding and assembly of the model five-domain homotetramer {beta}-galactosidase is obligatorily coupled to its synthesis on the ribosome, and define the underlying mechanisms. During refolding of full-length protein from denaturant, maturation of the catalytic domain is frustrated. Assembly outpaces monomer folding, and non-native oligomers accumulate. The ribosome directs the order of folding events and specifies the pathway of oligomer assembly. Efficient de novo folding is characterised by segmental domain folding, shaped by binding of a nascent amphipathic helix to a cryptic pocket on the ribosome surface. Homomer assembly initiates cotranslationally via recruitment of a full-length subunit to the nascent polypeptide, and the failure to do so results in misassembly. Our results reveal how the ribosome can dictate the timing of folding and assembly to enable efficient biogenesis of a topologically complex protein.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

One of the major challenges to understanding the role of condensates is the lack of technologies to map condensate-scale protein architecture at subcompartmental or nanoscale resolution. To address this, we introduce HCR-Proxy, a proximity labelling technique that couples Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR)-based signal amplification with in situ proximity biotinylation (Proxy), enabling proteomic profiling of RNA-proximal proteomes at subcompartmental resolution. We benchmarked HCR-Proxy using nascent pre-rRNA targets to investigate the distinct proteomic signatures of the nucleolar subcompartments and to uncover a spatial logic of protein partitioning shaped by RNA sequence. Our results demonstrate HCR-Proxy's ability to provide spatially-resolved maps of RNA interactomes within the nucleolus, offering new insights into the molecular organisation and compartmentalisation of condensates. This subcompartment-specific nucleolar proteome profiling enabled integration with deep learning frameworks, which effectively confirmed a sequence-encoded basis for protein partitioning across nested condensate subcompartments, characterised by antagonistic gradients in charge, length, and RNA-binding domains. HCR-Proxy thus provides a scalable platform for spatially resolved RNA interactome discovery, bridging transcript localisation with proteomic context in native cellular environments.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Moreover, we show that PTP1B was highly expressed in microglia, and its deficiency promoted a transcriptional shift toward immune activation and phagocytosis. Consistently, PTP1B deletion in microglia enhanced phagocytosis and metabolic fitness, supported by increased AKT-mTOR signaling, a pathway essential for meeting the energy demands of activation.

A serious concern in HLA peptide analysis is that the routinely used, collision-based fragmentation methods (CID/HCD) do not always render sufficiently informative MS2 spectra, whereby gaps in the fragmentation sequence coverage prevent unambiguous assignments. EThcD can be utilized to generate complementary ion series, i.e. b/y ions and c/z ions, resulting in richer, more informative MS2 spectra, thereby filling in the gaps. Here, we present data generated on a novel hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer, facilitating fast and efficient hybrid fragmentation due to the implementation of EThcD in the ion routing multipole. We hypothesized that this would enable more comprehensive and less error-prone analysis of immunopeptidomes at minimal costs in duty-cycle. First, we optimized ETD/EThcD methods using an elastase-digested cell lysate, as this contains peptides of similar length and charge distributions to immunopeptides. Next, we compared HCD and EThcD on immunopeptidomes originating from three cell lines with distinct HLA-I complexes that present peptides with varying physicochemical properties. We demonstrate that the new instrument not only enables efficient and fast ETD reactions, but when combined with collision-based supplemental activation, i.e. EThcD, also consistently increases the sequence coverage and identification of peptide sequences, otherwise missed by using solely HCD. We reveal several of the biochemical properties that make HLA peptides preferably identifiable by EThcD, with internal Arg residues being one of the most dominant determinants. Finally, we demonstrate the power of EThcD for the identification and localization of HLA peptides harboring post-translational modifications, focusing here on HLA Arg mono-/di-methylation. We foresee that this new instrument with efficient EThcD capabilities enhances not only immunopeptidomics analysis, but also analysis of peptides harboring post-translational modifications and de novo sequencing.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

We identified 257,252 viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) (>=5 kb), with 99% classified as novel, highlighting extensive uncharacterized viral diversity. Viruses exhibited a distinct host range, primarily targeting Proteobacteria, Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria, and DPANN archaea. Notably, CPR lineages displayed low virus-host ratios and viral CRISPR targeting multiple hosts, suggesting a virus decoy mechanism where they may absorb viral pressure, protecting bacteria hosts. Additionally, 3,378 vOTUs encoded auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) linked to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, with viruses targeting 31.5% of host metabolic modules. These findings demonstrate viruses influence on microbial metabolic reprogramming and nutrient cycling in groundwater, shaping subsurface biogeochemistry.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

While its prognostic significance remains debated, we demonstrate that HDAC6 loss significantly impairs myeloid leukemia progression in vivo, despite having no functional impact on leukemia cell proliferation in vitro. Global proteome and secretome profiling of HDAC6-knockout (KO) cells revealed upregulation of several immune-related modulators, including RNase T2, a tumor suppressor known to modulate the tumor microenvironment. Notably, RNase T2 upregulation upon HDAC6 loss was restricted to myeloid but not B-ALL cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 recapitulated this phenotype, leading to RNase T2 upregulation in myeloid leukemia cells. ATAC-seq revealed increased chromatin accessibility of RNase T2 following HDAC6 loss, highlighting a functionally epigenetic regulatory contribution. Further functional assays conducted in an immunocompetent setting both ex vivo and in vivo demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibition sensitized murine AML cells to broad CD8+ T cell activation as evidenced by increased TNF and CD107a expression. Consistently, in a syngeneic AML model, HDAC6 inhibition restricted AML cell growth. Moreover, an extended drug screening analysis identified Cytarabine and Clofarabine as significantly synergizing with HDAC6 inhibitor (Ricolinostat) in AML cell lines or pediatric patient derived xenograft (PDX)-AML cells, while showing limited synergy in ALL cell lines, PDX-ALL cells or healthy controls. These findings suggest that HDAC6 represents a promising therapeutic target in pediatric AML by simultaneously enhancing immune activation and increasing chemosensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the development of place selectivity, manifested as place fields, is believed to result from dendritic integration of spatially distributed inputs combined with behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP). BTSP involves dendritic spikes that temporally regulate synaptic potentiation and depotentiation. However, the role of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic distributions in the emergence of place specificity in CA1 PNs remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed synaptic reconstructions in vivo. Here, we present full synaptic reconstructions from individual CA1 PNs in the mouse hippocampus, revealing that these neurons receive approximately 10,000-15,000 E synapses and 900-1,400 I synapses. Computational modeling of biologically relevant E and I synaptic distributions shows that spatial tuning is preserved with co-tuned, spatially clustered E synapses, but disrupted when E distributions are randomized. Moreover, synapse clustering has a different contribution to spatial tuning in apical vs. basal domains. Our results reveal a complex and finely-tuned interplay between presynaptic input patterns and the spatial organization of their postsynaptic targets in dictating neuronal output in CA1 PNs.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

To overcome this limitation, we engineered Escherichia coli to utilize hydrogen gas (H2) and formate (HCOO-) as alternative sources of energy and reducing equivalents, thereby decoupling energy generation from carbon metabolism. This approach enabled precise suppression of decarboxylative oxidation during acetate growth, with 86.6 +/- 1.6% of electrons from hydrogen gas (via soluble hydrogenase from Cupriavidus necator H16) and 98.4 +/- 3.6% of electrons from formate (via formate dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. 101) offsetting acetate oxidation. Hydrogen gas supplementation led to a titratable and stoichiometric reduction in CO2; evolution in acetate-fed cultures. Metabolomic analysis suggests that this metabolic decoupling redirects carbon flux through the glyoxylate shunt, partially bypassing two decarboxylative steps in the TCA cycle. We demonstrated the utility of this strategy by applying it to mevalonate biosynthesis, where formate supplementation during glucose fermentation increased titers by 57.6% in our best-performing strain. Flux balance analysis further estimated that 99.0 +/- 2.8% of electrons from formate were used to enhance mevalonate production. These findings highlight a broadly applicable strategy for enhancing biomanufacturing efficiency by leveraging external reducing power to optimize carbon and energy use.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is considered an obligate anaerobic bacterium and has been implicated in inflammation-associated diseases, including colitis and colorectal cancer. Here we show that ETBF uses its virulence factor, Bacteroides fragilis toxin, to reprogram colonic epithelial cell metabolism to colonize the inflamed gut. Bacteroides fragilis toxin activates pro-tumorigenic signaling and hijacks the host bile acid recycling pathway, inducing a metabolic shift in the epithelium from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. This shift increases local concentrations of L-lactate and oxygen, nutrients that support an oxidative metabolism in ETBF. These findings reveal an unexpected strategy by which a pathogenic organism, previously considered to be an obligate anaerobic bacterium, generates and exploits an oxidative niche in the inflamed gut.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

However, Spiralia, a large bilaterian clade including molluscs and annelids, uses the Fibroblast Growth Factor pathway and ERK1/2 as the ancestral cue to establish their posterodorsal side. How this profound change in axial patterning evolved and what it implied for BMP's developmental role remains elusive. Here, we studied four annelid species and combined disruption of the BMP and Activin/Nodal pathways with transcriptomics and blastomere deletions to demonstrate that BMP is ancestrally downstream of ERK1/2 and promotes dorsoventral development in Spiralia. Importantly, this signalling hierarchy is lost in annelids that secondarily transitioned into a maternally controlled, autonomous development. While some, like Capitella teleta, use Activin/Nodal, Platynereis dumerilii relies on BMP to establish dorsoventral polarity only in the head. Unexpectedly, this divergence in upstream axial regulators implied extensive rewiring of downstream targets, as inferred by comparing C. teleta and Owenia fusiformis. Our data clarify the ancestral axial role for BMP in Spiralia, unveiling a potential causal link between parallel shifts to autonomous cell-fate specification in early development and the emergence of developmental system drift, a pervasive yet poorly understood phenomenon in animal embryogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Qualitative observations identified skewed microtubules in the twining stem of Ipomoea nil vine, suggesting parallels with Arabidopsis studies. To further investigate organ chirality in twining plants, we used common bean vine (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) to examine the relationship between microtubule orientation, cell morphogenesis, and the right-handed twining phenotype via immunolabeling techniques. Here, we report a transition from mixed microtubules orientations in emergent and elongating internodes to a predominance of longitudinal microtubules in straight and twined stem segments post-elongation. Additionally, we report a distinction in epidermal cell shapes, where the straight portions of the stem consist of lobes with rectangular cells and furrows comprised of round cells, while the twined portions are comprised of cells that are relatively more rectangular and stretched. We propose that these orientations reflect dynamic microtubule responses to external stimuli and growth cues, such as tensile stresses from climbing or tissue expansion.

Male mice become sexually satiated after successful matings, and their motivation to mate gradually recovers over a week. Using deep-brain fluorescence-lifetime imaging in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), we found that tonic dopamine transmission - which regulates mating drive - also declined after mating and re-emerged over a week. Two mechanisms regulated dopamine transmission. First, successful mating transiently reduced tonic firing of hypothalamic dopamine-releasing neurons, thereby inhibiting dopamine release and mating behavior. Second, mating reduced the ability of these neurons to produce and release dopamine, and this ability gradually returned over the week-long recovery time course. Therefore, fast and slow mechanisms of neuronal plasticity cooperate to control the early and late phases of motivational dynamics, respectively.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

While existing approaches have successfully linked BGCs to broad classes of chemical products, they typically operate in a single modality (genomic or chemical) limiting the scope of bidirectional prediction. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that integrates genomic and chemical information by projecting embeddings derived from pretrained language models into a common representation space. We embed genomic sequences using a BGC foundation model and represent molecules through a chemical language model, then use a metric learning model to co-embed BGCs and their associated chemical structures. This co-embedding space allows us to quantify the similarity between BGCs and compounds using similarity measures, enabling both forward and inverse retrieval tasks. Beyond retrieval, we show that the shared space can guide strain selection for targeted compounds. By identifying BGCs closest to a query compound in the embedding space, we prioritize microbial strains that encode similar clusters, thereby streamlining genome mining and retrobiosynthetic design efforts. This approach represents a generalizable, scalable strategy to bridge biological and chemical modalities in natural product discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Here, we investigated virological features of the XEC variant. Epidemic dynamics modeling suggested that spike substitutions in XEC mainly contribute to its increased viral fitness. Additionally, four licensed antivirals were effective against XEC. Although the fusogenicity of XEC spike is comparable to that of the JN.1 spike, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XEC in hamsters was significantly higher than that of JN.1. Notably, we found that the nucleocapsid R204P mutation of XEC enhanced inflammation through NF-{kappa}B activation.

We identified compartmentalized immune responses in acute LD, with coordinated alterations in circulating plasma proteins and metabolites linked to endothelial barrier stability, metabolic reprogramming, and symptom severity, predominantly traced to tissue and vascular immune processes at the site of infection.

However, variations exist across species and cell types, including architectures with fewer (e.g., 3+0, 6+0) or more than nine doublet microtubules (e.g., 9+9+0, 9+9+3), reflecting diverse structural adaptations of cilia and flagella in eukaryotes. Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, relies on its single 9+2 flagellum to navigate through environments within the mammalian host and insect vector. Central to the T. brucei flagellums function is a canonical central apparatus (CA), composed of two--C1 and C2-- singlet microtubules, which regulates flagellar beating and ensures efficient movement. Despite its crucial mechanoregulatory role in flagellar beating, the molecular structure and interactions governing T. brucei CA assembly and function remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to uncover structural details of the T. brucei CA. We identified conserved and stably C1/C2-associated protein densities, including the armadillo repeat protein PF16, which serves as a structural scaffold critical for CA assembly and axonemal asymmetry. Our analysis also revealed pronounced molecular flexibility of the CA and uncovered T. brucei-specific densities, suggesting lineage-specific adaptations for parasite motility. These findings provide critical insights into the structural foundations of T. brucei motility. They also highlight potential therapeutic targets to disrupt the parasites ability to cause disease, offering new avenues for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis. Comparison of CAs in this canonical 9+2 axoneme and non-canonical 9+n axonemes offers general insights into the assembly and diverse functions of CAs across a wide range of species.

SignificanceThe flagellum of Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite causing African trypanosomiasis, drives motility essential for host infection and disease transmission. Our cryogenic electron microscopy study reveals the molecular architecture of its central apparatus, identifying PF16 as a key scaffold that stabilizes axonemal asymmetry and imparts flexibility critical for flagellar beating. We uncover conserved proteins and T. brucei- specific adaptations, highlighting evolutionary divergence underlying the parasites distinctive motility. These structural results offer insights about how the central apparatus regulates T. bruceis bihelical motion and unveil potential therapeutic targets to disrupt flagellar function and combat African trypanosomiasis. Comparison among the central apparatus of canonical and non-canonical axonemes allow us to suggest broader principles underlying their central roles in ciliary functions across eukaryotes.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Trypsin is the gold-standard protease for bottom-up proteomics, though its cleavage specificity limits peptide identification, depending on the protein sequence. In addition, its optimal pH is weakly alkaline, which can cause modification artifacts such as deamidation. We hypothesized that these limitations might be overcome by using protease type XIII (P13ase) from Aspergillus saitoi, which is active at low pH. P13ase has been used for protein structural analysis by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, but its cleavage preferences have not been clarified. Here, we show that P13ase primarily cleaves the C-terminal side of Lys, Arg, and Leu, and the optimal P13ase digestion conditions for bottom-up proteomics are pH 3.5, 37C for 60 min. Under these conditions, sequence coverage of more than 90% was achieved for several proteins in HeLa cell extracts, which is unachievable with trypsin. In addition, P13ase digestion reduced artifacts such as deamidation products generated by cyclization reactions and subsequent hydrolysis. These results indicate that P13ase is a promising new tool for precision proteomics.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

These systems maintain proteostasis by facilitating membrane protein insertion, folding, and degradation. To gain structural insights into a putative complex formed by FtsH and YidC, we performed single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy on detergent-solubilized membrane samples, from which FtsH and YidC were purified using Ni-NTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography. Although SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a high purity of these proteins, cryo-EM datasets unexpectedly yielded high-resolution structures of ArnA and AcrB at 4.0 [A] and 2.9 [A] resolutions, respectively. ArnA is a bifunctional enzyme involved in lipid A modification and polymyxin resistance, while AcrB is a multidrug efflux transporter of the AcrAB-TolC system. ArnA and AcrB are known membrane protein contaminants after Ni-NTA purifications. However, they were also detected in Strep-Tactin affinity purified FtsH-YidC samples. ArnA, typically cytoplasmic, was consistently found in membrane-isolated samples, indicating an association with membrane components. Two-dimensional class averages revealed additional particles resembling GroEL, cytochrome bo oxidase, and the AAA+ cytoplasmic domain of FtsH. Although our preparation was initially considered homogeneous, neither full-size FtsH nor the intact FtsH-YidC complex could be resolved. This case highlights that cryo-EM can reveal structural information beyond the intended target, and that overexpression of membrane proteins involved in quality control may lead to the co-purification of proteins such as ArnA and AcrB.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Albertas health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework.

Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that uptake signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against ones conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives.

Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

We demonstrate that plasmid single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (plasmid Fiber-seq) can accurately map chromatin architectures along individual, full-length transfected plasmid molecules at near single-nucleotide resolution. Application of plasmid Fiber-seq to diverse plasmids and cell lines demonstrates that plasmids are chromatinized in a sequence-dependent organized manner and adopt a heterogeneous and incomplete chromatin architecture relative to nuclear-encoded chromatin fibers. We show that the focal occupancy of nucleosomes and transcription factors along transfected plasmids is central to their transcriptional activity within mammalian cells, and demonstrate that plasmids indeed are capable of recapitulating nuclear genome-encoded chromatin architectures, although not always. Finally, we demonstrate that combining plasmid Fiber-seq with high-throughput reporter assays can establish the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic non-coding variants, including disentangling the effects of transcriptional activators and repressors with near-single-nucleotide resolution. Overall, our findings reveal the principles by which plasmid-based assays can be used for accurate fine-scale mapping of chromatin-dependent regulatory grammar.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. They underscore the need to evaluate vaccines using clinical endpoints that extend beyond their targeted diseases.

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

Surface immunophenotyping alone is often insufficient, as interrogating functional capacity is required to determine cellular mechanisms and effectively inform diagnostic biomarker discovery, therapeutics and vaccine development. However, large panels with intracellular markers are subject to numerous challenges, including spectral overlap and background cellular autofluorescence, reducing resolving power for rare subsets or populations defined by low-abundance expression. We posited that mass cytometry may overcome such limitations; to address this, three small (11-12-plex) clone-matched antibody panels were evaluated by spectral flow and mass cytometry. Panels were comprised of surface and intracellular targets (phospho-epitopes, transcription factors or cytokines) and designed to minimize fluorescence spectral overlap. CyTOF technology offered superior signal resolution across the range of intracellular targets. Improved signal-to-noise provided better resolution of phospho-events and transcription factor expression, in particular TOX and T-bet. Most strikingly, stimulation-specific IL-10+ and IL-13+ cells were only detected by CyTOF. Superior resolution of these cytokines enabled accurate population clustering, permitting more unique immune cell signatures to be found, including Tr1 and Tc2 populations, thus providing a more comprehensive picture of the immuno-diversity present. Our findings indicate that CyTOF technology could catalyze seminal discoveries in functional immune profiling, driving therapeutic design and diagnostics.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

However, visualizing these interactions in vivo remains technically challenging. Here, we established fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy combined with Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) as a robust, spatially resolved technique to visualize protein interactions in living Staphylococcus aureus using fluorescent proteins. After systematically optimizing growth conditions and the analysis pipeline, we validated the method with cytosolic and membrane-anchored control proteins, achieving FRET efficiencies of up to 40%. Using FLIM-FRET, we mapped the protein interactions of the critical glycosyltransferase FtsW within the septal PG synthesizing complex. We confirmed its interaction with the cognate transpeptidase PBP1 and the regulatory protein DivIB. Notably, we found that FtsW also self-interacts, an observation corroborated by an alternative FLIM-FRET method employing Halo-Tag labelled with Janelia Fluor dyes. These findings support the hypothesis that septal PG synthesis may be carried out by a complex of multimers, capable of simultaneously synthesizing more than one glycan strand.

Inhibition of PG synthesis by directly targeting PBP1 with the beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem weakened the interaction between PBP1 and FtsW, whereas the FtsW self-interaction was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, inhibition of PG synthesis by targeting the lipid II flippase, therefore depleting the FtsW-PBP1 substrate from the outer surface of the cell membrane, had little effect on these interactions. This suggests that alterations in FtsW interactions result primarily from antibiotic-induced conformational changes or from uncoupling the activities of FtsW and PBP1, resulting in the presence of uncrosslinked glycans, rather than merely from a loss of PG synthesis activity.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Our current understanding of prophage activation is largely shaped by a narrow set of traditional DNA-damaging inducers, such as mitomycin C and ciprofloxacin, which trigger the bacterial SOS response. This study employed high-throughput screening of 3,921 compounds to identify novel prophage inducers using model lambdoid prophage HK97. We identified multiple new inducers across diverse pharmacological classes, including dietary supplements and therapeutics. Despite the variety in compounds, all acted through SOS-dependent pathways. However, bleomycin, an antineoplastic antibiotic, demonstrated broad-spectrum and potent prophage induction exceeding standard inducers, with activity validated across multiple phages and bacterial hosts. These findings expand the repertoire of prophage inducers into commonly ingested xenobiotics, and introduce Bleomycin as a powerful, cost-effective tool for prophage research.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

However, it remains unclear why these taxa are so dominant across a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics to test the hypothesis that strain-level differences exist in these taxa that are not adequately captured with standard marker gene sequencing, and that distinct strains harbor unique traits that reflect adaptations to different soil environments. We analyzed data from 331 natural soils spanning Australia to assess strain differentiation in Bradyrhizobium, a dominant soil bacterial genus of ecological importance. We developed a workflow for strain-level bacterial analyses of complex soil metagenomes, combining genomes from pre-existing databases with new genomes generated via targeted assembly from metagenomes to detect 181 Bradyrhizobium strains across the soil collection. In addition to a high degree of phylogenetic variation, we observed substantial variation in pangenome content and inferred traits, highlighting the breadth of diversity within this widespread genus. While members of the genus Bradyrhizobium were detected in > 80% of samples, most individual strains were restricted in their distributions. The overall strain-level community composition of Bradyrhizobium varied significantly across geographic space and environmental gradients, and was particularly associated with differences in temperature, soil pH, and soil nitrate and metal concentrations. Our work provides a general framework and methodology for studying the strain-level ecology of soil bacteria and highlights the ecological and pangenomic diversity within this dominant soil bacterial genus.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

The vast majority of GPCR drugs bind the conserved orthosteric pocket, which can lead to non-specificity and toxicity. Precision modalities such as biased signaling and allosteric modulation could lead to GPCR therapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The rational design of precision therapies is, however, limited by the lack of high-resolution functional understanding of GPCRs. Here we present a general approach to chart high-resolution functional maps of GPCRs and apply the approach to the {beta}2 adrenergic receptor. Across [~]150,000 measurements of five different phenotypes, we construct an unprecedented picture of signaling properties of this model receptor. A contiguous core activation network of residues required for signaling links the ligand binding site to the transducer binding site. Residues controlling signaling parameters connect to this core network, with determinants of signaling bias located more peripherally. Dose-response curves for nearly all possible amino acid substitutions, a total of >7,500 different proteins, reveal the relationship between expression level and potency; and the spatial distribution of potency changing residues. The multi-modal maps rationalize previous serendipitously discovered allosteric sites and prospectively annotate novel sites to target. Application of this approach across the superfamily of GPCRs will unlock deep understanding of these critical molecules and enable rational design of precision GPCR therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

In yeast, the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) expands during glucose starvation through the recruitment of stress-specific proteins, but the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance remained unclear. Here, we identify the yeast INSIG homologs Nsg1, Nsg2, along with the aspartyl protease Ypf1 as glucose starvation-specific NVJ-localized factors. Ypf1 promotes the recruitment of INSIG proteins and the HMG-CoA reductases Hmg1 and Hmg2 to the NVJ, likely in response to nuclear membrane remodeling induced by changes in very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism. We further demonstrate that this membrane remodeling destabilizes Nsg1, promoting the NVJ localization and activation of Hmg1, while stabilizing Nsg2, which counteracts Hmg1 activation. These findings reveal that Nsg1 and Nsg2, previously known as regulators of Hmg2 stability, also act as negative regulators of Hmg1. Based on these results, we propose a model in which VLCFAs modulate the physical properties of the nuclear membrane, enabling cells to sense glucose starvation and regulate sterol metabolism during glucose starvation. Overall, our study provides new insights into MCS-mediated metabolic stress responses and highlights the role of membrane properties as active regulators of lipid homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Adaptation of NVJ functions to metabolic cues is mediated by a striking remodeling of the size and the proteome of the contact site, but the extent and the molecular determinants of this plasticity are not fully understood. Using microscopy-based screens, we monitored NVJ remodeling in response to glucose availability. We identified Pex31, Nsg1, Nsg2, Shr5, and Tcb1 as NVJ residents. Glucose starvation typically results in an expansion of the NVJ size and proteome. Pex31 shows an atypical behavior, being specifically enriched at the NVJ at high glucose conditions. Loss of Pex31 uncouples NVJ remodeling from glucose availability, resulting in recruitment of glucose starvation-specific residents and NVJ expansion at glucose replete conditions. Moreover, PEX31 deletion results in alterations of sterol ester storage and a remodeling of vacuolar membranes that phenocopy glucose starvation responses. We conclude that Pex31 has a role in metabolic adaptation of the NVJ.

Recent studies have suggested that these changes can be partially explained by altered sensory feedback processing when producing speech. Individuals with PD (IwPD) may fail to monitor sensory feedback from their own voice, impairing their ability to adjust voice and speech when sensory input differs from expectations. In this study, we investigated sensory feedback processing in PD by looking at the sensory attenuation typically observed in event-related responses (ERP) to the self-generated voice. When sensory feedback processing is intact, the P50, N100, and P200 ERP responses to the self-generated voice are more attenuated than to an externally-generated voice. Twenty-three IwPD and 23 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a voice playback study that comprised three conditions: self-generated voice (auditory-motor condition; AMC), externally-generated voice (auditory-only condition; AOC), and motor-only. The AMC and AOC conditions also included an amplitude modulation of the voice (0/+15dB). Linear mixed models assessed group differences in ERP morphology. While groups did not differ in their P50 and P200 responses, there was a significant group-condition-loudness interaction for the N100. Follow-up analyses showed that IwPD displayed much larger N100 error responses for unexpected loudness modulations as compared to HC. This observation suggests that IwPD may process voice modulations differently than HC. The hypersensitivity to loudness changes may underlie IwPD's difficulties in processing and adapting their voice acoustics.","NA","biorxiv",1748902215131

Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of thirty ""commitments"" which can be verifiably actioned without requiring institutional support. These commitments were collaboratively developed by thirteen group leaders in life sciences, from institutions across eight countries, instigated through the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop. The importance of each commitment has been scored by more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, from more than twenty countries. Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both).

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden.

ObjectiveOur goal is to evaluate changes in metabolite concentration levels associated with AD to identify biomarkers that could support early and accurate diagnosis and therapeutic interventions by using targeted mass spectrometry and machine learning approaches.

MethodsSerum samples collected from a total of 107 individuals, including 55 individuals diagnosed with AD and 52 healthy controls (HC) enrolled previously to ADDIA cohort were analyzed using the Biocrates(R) 400 metabolite panel. Several machine learning models including Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained to classify AD and HC. Repeated cross-validation was used to ensure performance evaluation.

ResultsWe identified 18 metabolites with nominal differences (p<0.05; AUC>0.60) between AD and HC. These included alterations in acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, triglycerides, and amino acids, suggesting disruptions in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. The best model achieved an average AUC of 0.88 on the train set and 0.73 on the test set. Classification performance was further improved by combining multiple metabolites in a single panel and adding APOE genotyping (AUC=0.902).

ConclusionsThese results highlight important metabolic signatures that could help to reduce misdiagnosis and support the development of metabolomic panels to detect AD. The combination of multiple serum metabolic biomarkers and APOE genotyping can significantly improve classification accuracy and potentially assist in making non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic approach.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

We implemented and evaluated multiple deep learning models, including a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), an uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo-Dropout CNN (MCD-CNN), as well as a few-shot learning approach to address dataset size limitations. Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1748902215131

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
