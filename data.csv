Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.","[{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MURI N00014-23-1-2768;MURI W911NF2410228;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01MH131715-01;R01MH11559;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21AG077275-01A1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) integrates multiple metabolic inputs to produce uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), a central substrate for protein and lipid glycoconjugates. While UDP-GlcNAc levels influence pluripotency, the broader metabolic roles of the HBP in stem cell maintenance and differentiation remain largely unexplored. Using proteomic and metabolomic analyses, we uncovered extensive enzymatic remodelling of the HBP during early mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation, including a significant decrease in N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) levels, despite stable UDP-GlcNAc levels. Isotope labelling experiments revealed that pluripotent stem cells maintain UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis through a combination of glucose-driven de novo synthesis and the N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) salvage pathway, both of which are downregulated during differentiation. Functionally, we identified GlcNAc6P--a point of convergence of the de novo synthesis and the salvage pathways--as a pivotal metabolite of stem cell fate. Preventing GlcNAc6P's deacetylation by deleting or depleting AMDHD2 impaired mESC differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GlcNAc6P catabolism is essential for sustaining cytosolic acetate and in turn acetyl-CoA levels, which are critical for lipid synthesis and histone modifications required for pluripotency exit. These findings establish AMDHD2 as a key supplier of cellular acetate and reveal an essential metabolic link between HBP activity and acetyl-CoA homeostasis. By expanding the role of the HBP beyond UDP-GlcNAc production, this study reveals an unrecognised metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to manipulate stem cell identity.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DE 2326/3-1;""},{""name"":""JÃ¼rgen Manchot Stiftung"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PhD project Lea Hund;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

REM sleep comprises about twenty percent of adult sleep, alternates between phasic and tonic periods, and includes delta waves (1-4Hz) in two forms: fast sawtooth waves and slower, NREM-like waves, whose expression dynamically varies across REM periods. Yet, the functional relevance of these REM sleep delta waves remains unknown. Here, using two independent cohorts, we show that aging is associated with a shift from fast sawtooth to slow NREM-like delta waves, particularly during phasic REM sleep--a period typically marked by high cortical activation. Beyond chronological age, this shift is associated with amyloid-beta and tau burden, suggesting that AD pathology disrupts REM-specific oscillatory patterns. Furthermore, this shift in REM oscillations is linked to impaired overnight memory consolidation, independent of NREM sleep quality. Moreover, variation in ApoE alleles, a major genetic risk factor for AD, was independently associated with a reduction in fast sawtooth wave density, thereby linking a genetic predisposition for AD to these specific REM microstructural changes. These findings identify a novel signature of memory decline in aging and implicate REM sleep as a distinct vulnerable substrate through which AD pathology may impair brain function.","[{""name"":""National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RF1AG054106;""},{""name"":""Glenn Foundation for Medical Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebg5q27"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

The organism displays a surprisingly rich locomotor repertoire, emerging from the intricate dynamics of the cilia, which form a tight bundle when swimming. We leverage high-speed quantitative live imaging to extract the spectrum of possible ciliary beating patterns, and derive a dispersion relation coupling the temporal frequency and spatial wavelength of cilia oscillations. We further reconstruct the attractor manifold embedded in the behavioural space, showing that despite the range and complexity of ciliary beating modes, the underlying behavioural manifold is intrinsically low-dimensional with elaborate topological structure.

Leveraging sequence-to-function deep learning models, we discovered 301 sequence motifs and predicted the functional impact of genetic variants through in silico mutagenesis, thereby facilitating the decoding of the regulatory syntax of the cattle genome and fine-mapping of GWAS loci for 22 complex traits. Cross-species analysis further revealed evolutionarily conserved features of regulatory architecture and provided evolutionary insights into complex traits and diseases in humans.

This has resulted in the accumulation of studies estimating the age-specific demographic transition rates across the tree of life over the last few decades. Although this accumulation of studies has enabled comparative demographic analyses to be developed, such analyses remain difficult to perform because age-specific data are scattered across literature. Here, we present a new open-access database, malddaba, which compiles age-specific demographic rates for mammals in the wild from published information.

Each series is reported using a standardized approach aimed at facilitating the extraction and use of that dataset by anyone interested in comparative biology. We show how malddaba can be used to address a variety of questions, ranging from comparative ageing with the assessment of actuarial and reproductive senescence patterns in a wide diversity of mammals. We can also address questions related to comparative population dynamics. For this purpose, in addition to the raw demographic rate records, we were able to build 43 population-specific life tables using malddaba records, which allow demographic outputs to be estimated accurately, such as population growth rate and generation time for those species.

Using simulations of virtual species with diverse life-history traits and range dynamics, we found that SDMs consistently underestimated extinction risk for range-shifting species. This was due to a concave relationship between population size and habitat loss, which contradicts the linear assumption in the Red List guidelines. For range-contracting species, SDMs provided adequate warning times. Probabilistic extinction estimates from SEPMs provided delayed warning for all species, particularly for highly threatened ones.

In one case (Ncaph2), a C-terminal auxin-inducible degron fusion strongly increased protein stability in some tissues but decreased it in others. Destabilisation resulted from tissue-specific  leakage of the auxin-inducible degron, which depended on TIR1 expression, and occurred selectively in the small intestine where basal concentrations of auxin / indole-3-acetic acid can reach levels that are sufficient to trigger protein degradation in cultured cells. Stabilisation occurred in post-mitotic cells via an endogenous degradation signal situated at the Ncaph2 C-terminus, which normally undergoes activation upon cell cycle exit, but is inactivated by C-terminal tag fusion.

Arabidopsis thaliana, like other Brassica plants including crops, produce and store large amounts of aliphatic glucosinolates (aGLS). Upon Ssc invasion and tissue damage, myrosinase enzymes transform aGLS into toxic metabolites, including aliphatic isothiocyanates (aITCs). Adapted Ssc strains can detoxify aITCs by hydrolyzing them with the enzyme SaxA, which is important for its virulence. Here, we find that this detoxification is critical for bacterial enrichment in necrotic lesions, since a SaxA-deficient strain does not alter the bacteriome. Additionally, our results suggest that both aliphatic and other GLSs likely contribute specific effects to this phenomenon. Thus, we demonstrate a mechanism in which the interaction of host and pathogen factors together shape a pathogen-associated bacteriome, providing directions to better understand interactions of host bacteria with foliar necrotic pathogens.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EXC 2051 - Projektnummer 390713860;Projektnummer 458884166;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

While a class of neurons on average innervates its entire surroundings, each individual one can only cover a small part of the space. That part is different for each neuron, but in a way that is not completely random, as it must be spatially continuous due to the physicality of neurites. We tested predictions from our hypothesis successfully in biophysically-detailed models and an electron-microscopic (EM) reconstruction of cortical connectivity. We distilled it into a simple stochastic algorithm that generates networks, which accurately match the EM reconstruction in basic network statistics as well as functionally relevant metrics of complexity.

Within the sand flys alimentary tract, these parasite forms encounter shifts in temperature, pH and nutrient availability, which trigger significant morphological and physiological adaptations. Membrane transporter proteins, channels and pumps play a crucial role in facilitating the movement of solutes across eukaryotic membranes. Previously, a systematic loss-of-function screen of the L. mexicana ""transportome"" identified forty transporter deletion mutants that caused significant loss of fitness in macrophage and mouse infections. Here, using an independently generated library of over 300 barcoded gene deletion mutants, we monitored their growth fitness for seven days in vitro and tested which transporters are required for Leishmania promastigotes to successfully colonise Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies for nine days. Overall, fitness scores correlated between promastigotes from long-term in vitro culture and in vivo sand fly infections. More importantly, for 34 mutants, a significant loss of fitness was observed exclusively in vivo. Moreover, deletion of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) proved detrimental for parasite persistence and promastigote differentiation in the sand fly, uncovering a key role for the V-ATPase at different stages throughout the Leishmania life cycle.

Author SummaryLeishmania parasites cause leishmaniases - a group of neglected tropical diseases that affect millions of people worldwide. These parasites must survive in two radically different environments: inside a mammalian host and within the gut of a blood-feeding sand fly. To thrive in the sand fly, Leishmania undergo extensive physiological changes and depend on transporter proteins to move nutrients and other molecules across their cell membranes. In this study, we focused on identifying which of these transporters are critical for the parasites survival inside the sand fly. We used a genetically engineered library of Leishmania promastigotes - the parasite form adapted to the insect vector - to assess the importance of more than 300 different transporter genes.

Gene flow--via within-population dispersal and external immigration--shapes population health and evolutionary potential by boosting genetic diversity, but it can also counteract local adaptation. We investigate these processes in a population of great tits (Parus major) in Wytham Woods, United Kingdom. This system represents a large, continuous population of a vagile, widely distributed species. Using a comprehensive social pedigree alongside genomic data from two genomic datasets, one with 949 individuals genotyped at ~600,000 SNPs and another with 2,644 individuals at ~10,000 SNPs, we observe some spatial genetic structure largely driven by the spatial and temporal clustering of close kin. We quantify how temporally persistent this pattern is and find similar levels of decay of relatedness with distance across years, without a consistent genetic basis, which is frequently renewed due to high population turnover. Immigrants make up a substantial portion of the breeding population, yet are often assumed to be genetically distinct, unrelated, and outbred--assumptions that can bias population inferences. We show that immigrants are indeed outbred, as are local birds; have fewer close relatives within the population, and are less likely to be related to their neighbours than locally born birds. Despite low FST and no clear genome-wide population structure, immigrants and locals can be distinguished above chance using a Random Forest classifier trained on SNP data. Our study highlights the complex interplay between dispersal, population turnover and spatial population structure, and suggests that great tits in Wytham Woods experience substantial gene flow within the population and from immigrants, maintaining high genetic diversity and reducing the possibility of local adaptation at this spatial scale.","[{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""250164;202487;""},{""name"":""Natural Environment Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02b5d8509"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""NE/J012599;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024520/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B âMeiosisâ;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour lâEducation et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.

A key component of social behavior is approach, where animals actively move to-ward social partners to maintain group cohesion, establish affiliations, and coordinate actions. While a continuous stream of social information is encoded across sensory modalities, it remains unclear whether a distinct neural process underlies social approach. Here, we developed a novel assay in which a head-fixed, tail-free zebrafish interacts with a freely swimming conspecific, enabling precise quantification of social behavior alongside whole-brain functional imaging at cellular resolution. We demonstrate that zebrafish approach behavior is jointly shaped by spatial and temporal information from conspecifics rather than by these features acting independently. Social approach behavior is preceded by distinct brain-wide neural activity patterns emerging seconds before movement onset, characterized by increased activity in a small subset of forebrain neurons and decreased activity in midbrain and hindbrain neuronal populations. These activity patterns reliably predict upcoming approach movements from each of these regions separately. Moreover, the extent to which neural activity distinguishes approach from non-approach movements predicts individual differences in social behavior, directly linking neural dynamics to behavioral variability. Together, our findings reveal a neural mechanism underlying social approach behavior, highlighting how a distributed yet functionally coordinated network facilitates social interaction.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779

Most current methods fall at one of two extremes: either opaque deep learning models that obscure biological meaning, or simplified frameworks that treat genes as isolated units. As such, these approaches overlook a crucial insight: gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cellular states can be harnessed to model perturbation responses. Here we present CIPHER (Covariance Inference for Perturbation and High-dimensional Expression Response), a conceptual framework leveraging linear response theory from statistical physics to predict transcriptome-wide perturbation outcomes using gene co-fluctuations in unperturbed cells. We validated CIPHER on synthetic regulatory networks before applying it to 11 large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets covering 4,234 perturbations and over 1.36M cells. CIPHER robustly recapitulated genome-wide responses to single and double perturbations by exploiting baseline gene covariance structure. Importantly, eliminating gene-gene covariances, while retaining gene-intrinsic variances, reduced model performance by 11-fold, demonstrating the rich information stored within baseline fluctuation structures. Moreover, gene-gene correlations transferred successfully across independent experiments of the same cell type, revealing stereotypic fluctuation structures. Furthermore, CIPHER outperformed conventional differential expression metrics in identifying true perturbations while providing uncertainty-aware effect size estimates through Bayesian inference. Finally, most genome-wide responses propagated through the covariance matrix along approximately three independent and global gene modules. CIPHER underscores the importance of theoretically-grounded models in capturing complex biological responses, highlighting fundamental design principles encoded in cellular fluctuation patterns.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""DMS-2235451;""},{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MPTMPS-00005320;""},{""name"":""NUCATS T32, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Ryan Fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""CSB postdoc fellowship, Northwestern University"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IVADO"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Canada First Research Excellence Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the NIH"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM147400;""},{""name"":""Pew-Stewart Scholars Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Awards at the Scientific Interface"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub Chicago"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756246097779
