However, designing highly stable mRNAs with programmable cell type-specificity remains a challenge. To address this, we measured the regulatory activity of 60,000 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) across six cell types and developed PARADE (Prediction And RAtional DEsign of mRNA UTRs), a generative AI framework to engineer untranslated RNA regions with tailored cell type-specific activity. We validated PARADE by testing 15,800 de novo-designed sequences across these cell lines and identified many sequences that demonstrated superior specificity and activity compared to existing RNA therapeutics. mRNAs with PARADE-engineered UTRs also exhibited robust tissue-specific activity in animal models, achieving selective expression in the liver and spleen. We also leveraged PARADE to enhance mRNA stability, significantly increasing protein output and therapeutic durability in vivo. These advancements translated to notable increases in therapeutic efficacy, as PARADE-designed UTRs in oncosuppressor mRNAs, namely PTEN and P16, effectively reduced tumor growth in patient-derived neuroglioma xenograft models and orthotopic mouse models. Collectively, these findings establish PARADE as a versatile platform for designing safer, more precise, and highly stable mRNA therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

In previous studies, we found enhanced IgG reactivity to EBV EBNA4 and EBNA6 arginine-rich sequences in postinfectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS).

ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) EBNA4 and EBNA6 sequences and homologous human sequences in PCS and ME/CFS.

MethodsThe IgG responses against poly-R EBNA4 and EBNA6 and corresponding homologous human 15-mer peptides and respective full-length proteins were analyzed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex dot-blot assay. Sera of 45 PCS patients diagnosed according to WHO criteria, with 26 patients fulfilling the Canadian Consensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 patients with non-COVID post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 healthy controls (HC) were investigated.

ResultsAutoantibodies to poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal antigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-{beta} signaling regulator TSPLY2, angiogenic regulator TSPYL5, as well as to full-length -adrenergic receptor (ADRA) proteins were more frequent in patients. Several autoantibodies were positively associated with key symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognition, and pain.

ConclusionCollectively, we identified autoantibodies with new antigen specificities with a potential role in PCS and ME/CFS.

Clinical ImplicationThese finding should prompt further studies on the function of these autoantibodies, their exploitation for diagnostic use, and of drugs targeting autoantibodies.

Capsule summaryOur study reveals elevated autoantibodies to EBV-related poly-R sequences and their human homologues in PCS and ME/CFS patients associated with symptom severity, suggesting a potential role in disease pathogenesis.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077

Virulent phages, characterized by their obligatory lytic cycle, are assumed to lack the ability to persist within bacterial colonies, and their infection is expected to decimate the host population under in-vitro conditions. Consequently, when bacterial isolates are cultured for sequencing, the resulting assemblies are not expected to contain virulent phage genomes. To test this assumption on a large scale, we analyzed over 267,000 publicly available Escherichia assemblies. Surprisingly, we identified 373 genomes corresponding to virulent phages within the bacterial genomes. These viral genomes are associated with specific phage groups and especially with jumbo phages with very large genomes (>200 kb). Chimallin was a core gene in two of these jumbo phage clusters, the major protein used by some jumbo phages to form a protective phage nucleus during infection. We found multiple lines of evidence suggesting that these virulent phage genomes in bacterial assemblies arise from persistent infections rather than contamination. Supporting this, we experimentally demonstrated the coexistence of non-temperate jumbo phages with their bacterial hosts. In a targeted follow-up search for three clades of persistent jumbo phages, we identified 285 additional jumbo phage genomes in bacterial taxa beyond Escherichia, highlighting that there are many more undiscovered persistent phages in bacterial assemblies. Our findings challenge the traditional virulent-temperate dichotomy, highlighting the overlooked diversity and prevalence of non-canonical phage lifestyles.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Increased expression of the stem cell transcription factor, MECOM, underlies one key driver mechanism in largely incurable AMLs. How MECOM results in such aggressive AML phenotypes remains unknown. To address existing experimental limitations, we engineered and applied targeted protein degradation with functional genomic readouts to demonstrate that MECOM promotes malignant stem cell-like states by directly repressing pro-differentiation gene regulatory programs. Remarkably and unexpectedly, a single node in this network, a MECOM-bound cis-regulatory element located 42 kb downstream of the myeloid differentiation regulator CEBPA, is both necessary and sufficient for maintaining MECOM-driven leukemias. Importantly, targeted activation of this regulatory element promotes differentiation of these aggressive AMLs and reduces leukemia burden in vivo, suggesting a broadly applicable differentiation-based approach for improving therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

However, much of the supporting evidence was developed using the statistic D, which assumes, without testing, both that mutation rate is constant and that recurrent mutations are vanishingly rare. These assumptions together preclude an alternative explanation based on variation in mutation rates across human populations. Here we critically evaluate the assumptions underlying D and confirm that neither is valid. Over 40% of SNPs in dbSNP carry recurrent mutations. Theory indicates that D does not vary with mutation rate as long as the mutation rate does not vary between populations. In practice, D calculated separately for different sequence motifs varies greatly, implying strongly that mutation rates do vary between populations. We show that most, if not all, D-informative sites result from two mutations rather than the one mutation expected under the introgression hypothesis. Moreover, individual non-Africans carry a signal in more than five times as many genomic windows as can be accounted for by the 2% legacy they are thought to carry, indicating a signal that is radically more diffuse than expected. Remarkably, partitioning the data by whether the chimpanzee or Neanderthal allele is the major allele in humans reveals that the overall reported D-value of ~5% actually comprises two opposing components: one with D ~ 30% and another with D ~ -25%. Tellingly, the positive component is produced by sites where the Neanderthal allele is the major allele, the exact opposite of what should be the case under introgression, where introgressed alleles should be rare. We show further that the entire D signal can be accounted for by sites where the Neanderthal allele is fixed outside Africa and the chimpanzee allele is rare inside Africa. Investigating potential mechanisms, we extend the published observation that the mutability of three-base combinations across human populations is influenced by flanking sequence heterozygosity to reveal how genomic regions that lost more heterozygosity out of Africa exhibit higher D-values. This correlation supports a model where loss of heterozygosity slowed the mutation rate, thereby reducing the divergence between Neanderthals and non-Africans. Across independent tests, our findings consistently indicate that the mutation rate variation hypothesis provides a more compelling explanation for the observed patterns in human-Neanderthal genetic relationships than the introgression hypothesis. We argue that the mutation rate variation hypothesis would help settle a number of conflicting patterns in the literature and, hence, that the concept of archaic introgression into humans and its implications for hominin-derived traits warrants reconsideration.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

ObjectiveTo further investigate the putative association between semaglutide use and NAION.

DesignBi-national active comparator new-user cohort study with propensity score weighing to adjust for confounding, fixed-effect meta-analysis, and a supplementary self-controlled analysis (symmetry analysis).

SettingData were obtained from national health registries in Denmark and Norway, including prescription registries, patient registries, and civil registration systems.

ParticipantsNew users of semaglutide and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) during 2018-2022 (Norway) and 2018-2024 (Denmark).

ExposuresInitiation of semaglutide and SGLT-2is for the management of type 2 diabetes was assessed in the main analysis. In the self-controlled design, exposure to semaglutide, regardless of indication, was investigated.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresIncidence rates of NAION among semaglutide and SGLT-2is users, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and incidence rate differences (IRDs) with robust 95% confidence intervals. Estimates from Denmark and Norway were pooled using a fixed-effects model (inverse variance weighting). The supplementary self-controlled study returned sequence symmetry ratios (SRs).

ResultsWe identified 44,517 eligible users of semaglutide for the management of type 2 diabetes in Denmark and 16,860 in Norway. In total, we observed 32 NAION events among semaglutide users (24 in Denmark and 8 in Norway). This yielded an unadjusted incidence rate of NAION of 2.19/10,000 person-years among Danish semaglutide initiators, compared to 1.18 among SGLT-2i initiators. The corresponding unadjusted incidence rates in Norway were 2.90 and 0.92. After adjustment, we obtained a pooled HR of 2.81 (95% CI 1.67 to 4.75) and IRD of +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29). Estimates were compatible in the individual countries, although with higher and less precise estimates in Norway (HR 7.25; 95% CI 2.34 to 22.4) compared to Denmark (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.20 to 3.92). Results were consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis, with a notably stronger association observed in a post hoc per-protocol analysis (HR 6.35; 95% CI 2.88 to 14.0). In the supplementary self-controlled study, SRs for NAION were 1.14 (95% CI 0.55 to 2.36) in Denmark and 2.67 (95% CI 0.91 to 8.99) in Norway.

Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings show an association between use of semaglutide for type 2 diabetes and risk of NAION. However, the absolute risk remains low.

Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSIs there an association between semaglutide use and risk of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)?

FindingsIn this cohort study conducted in Denmark and Norway, use of semaglutide was associated with an increased risk of NAION; the pooled hazard ratio was 2.81 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 4.75) and the incidence rate difference (absolute risk increase) was +1.41 (95% CI +0.53 to +2.29) NAION events per 10,000 person-years. The finding was consistent across sensitivity and supplementary analysis.

MeaningOur study confirms that use of semaglutide is associated to an increased risk of NAION, but also that the excess absolute risk is low.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077

These complex networks have been shown to be disrupted during aging, disease, and cancer. However, profiling these networks across diverse cell types and states has been limited due to the technical constraints of existing methods for mapping DNA:Protein interactions in single cells. As a result, a critical gap remains in understanding where TFs or other chromatin remodelers bind to DNA and how these interactions are perturbed in pathological contexts. To address this challenge, we developed a transformative single-cell immuno-tethering DNA:Protein mapping technology. By coupling a species-specific antibody-binding nanobody to a cytosine base editing enzyme, this approach enables profiling of even weak or transient factor binding to DNA, a task that was previously unachievable in single cells. Thus, our Docking & Deamination followed by sequencing (D&D-seq) technique induces cytosine-to-uracil edits in genomic regions bound by the target protein, offering a novel means to capture DNA:Protein interactions with unprecedented resolution. Importantly, this technique can be seamlessly incorporated into common single-cell multiomics workflows, enabling multimodal analysis of gene regulation in single cells. We tested the ability of D&D-seq to record TF binding both in bulk and at the single-cell level by profiling CTCF and GATA family members, obtaining high specificity and efficiency, with clear identification of TF footprint and signal retention in the targeted cell subpopulations. Furthermore, the deamination reaction showed minimal off-target activity, with high concordance to bulk ChIP-seq reference data. Applied to primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), D&D-seq successfully identified CTCF binding sites and enabled integration with advanced machine-learning algorithms for predicting 3D chromatin structure. Furthermore, we integrated D&D-seq with single-cell genotyping to assess the impact of IDH2 mutations on CTCF binding in a human clonal hematopoiesis sample, uncovering altered binding and chromatin co-accessibility patterns in mutant cells. Altogether, D&D-seq represents an important technological advance enabling the direct mapping of TF or chromatin remodeler binding to the DNA in primary human samples, opening new avenues for understanding chromatin and transcriptional regulation in health and disease.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

We identify BNST neurons defined by the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 3, VGluT3. VGluT3 neurons were localized to anteromedial BNST, were molecularly distinct from accumbal VGluT3 neurons, and co-express vesicular GABA transporter (VGaT). Cell-type specific presynaptic processes were identified in arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), regions critical for feeding and homeostatic regulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, while these neurons co-express VGluT3 and VGaT, they functionally transmit GABA to both ARC and PVN, with rare glutamate co-transmission to ARC. Neuronal recordings of VGluT3 BNST neurons showed greater calcium-dependent signaling in response to sucrose consumption while sated compared with fasted. When fasted, optogenetic stimulation of BNST VGluT3 neurons decreased sucrose consumption using several stimulation conditions but not when stimulation occurred prior to sucrose access, suggesting that BNST VGluT3 activation concurrent with consumption in the fasted state reduces feeding. BNST VGluT3 activation during anxiety-like paradigms (novelty-suppressed feeding, open field, and elevated zero maze) and real-time place conditioning resulted in no changes in anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior. We interpret these data such that VGluT3 BNST neurons represent a unique cellular population within the BNST that provides inhibitory input to hypothalamic regions to decrease feeding without affecting anxiety-like or reward/aversion behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Modification of pre-existing ligands with fragments that can alter the protein surface can lead to the creation of novel compounds (targeted glues) able to induce neo-interactions between the target and an E3 ligase, resulting in targeted protein degradation. By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

In most conditioned suppression studies, forward conditioning is used where a cue predicts an aversive stimulus. However, backward conditioning, in which an aversive stimulus predicts a cue, provides unique insights into learned avoidance due to its influence on both conditioned excitation and inhibition. We trained mice to consume sucrose in context A, associated an aversive stimulus in context B to few or many forward or backwards paired cues (CS+), and then tested for conditioned suppression in context A in response to the CS+. We found that few or many forward CS+ and few backward CS+ produced conditioned suppression, but many backwards cues did not. Administration of diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor, prevented conditioned suppression to the backward CS+ but not to the forward CS+. Furthermore, freezing behavior was observed in response to the forward CS+ but not the backward CS+, and diazepam had no effect on freezing or locomotion. We next examined BNST GABA neurons for potential sensitivity to backwards cues and conditioned suppression. VGaT BNST signaling increased in response to sucrose licks during the backward CS+ but not to licks outside the CS+ and not to the backward CS+ onset or offset. Using designer receptors, we found that BNST VGaT neuron activation, but not its inhibition, prevented backward conditioned suppression expression. We conclude that backward conditioned suppression is dependent on both positive allosteric modulation of GABA on GABA-A receptors by diazepam and BNST GABA neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

The coordinated determination of cell fates is crucial in any developmental process and requires extensive intercellular communication. Plants cells exchange many molecular signals via the symplasmic pathway, i.e., via plasmodesmata: narrow channels connecting the cytoplasm of neighbouring cells. Regulation of symplasmic transport is vital for normal plant development, and mutations that disrupt this regulation are often embryo or seedling lethal. In many tissues, symplasmic transport of small molecules is diffusion driven, resulting in a non-selective and bidirectional transport, although net directionality could arise from gradients. This has led to the (dogmatic) belief that symplasmic transport can only be detrimental to pattern formation, because signalling molecules cannot be confined, and gradients would fade. Here, we develop a detailed biophysical description of symplasmic transport to explore how plasmodesmata affect gradients in a linear tissue. We then apply the model in more complex tissue contexts, observing and explaining, e.g., that symplasmic transport may result in steeper gradients in the root apical meristem. In conclusion, our model provides a reference framework for estimating the consequences of symplasmic transport and explains how symplasmic transport can contribute to more robust developmental patterning.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Although the use of RNA-degraded tissues in transcriptome analysis remains controversial, such samples are sometimes the sole means to address specific questions. Current studies on the impact of PMI on transcriptome data are limited to large-scale RNA-seq, which ignores cellular heterogeneity. Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects caused by PMI is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Here, we investigated the impact of PMI on cellular components and gene expression using snRNA-seq data from mouse brain tissues of post-mortem. We collected samples that were allowed to decay for varying amounts of time at 25 C prior to snRNA-seq, covering the entire range of RIN values. The different effects on the PMI to the degradation rate of mRNA and rRNA within nuclei, and the mRNA presented a more stable state. Multi-channel analysis revealed the preferential transient depletion oligodendrocytes and OPCs with increasing PMI. In addition, a rapid widespread overregulation of ribosomal transient recruitment to protein (RP) genes in various cells, and reached a plateau at PMI of 36h. Although state depletion of neuronal cells was not detected, we reported significant upregulation of PMI-dependent RP genes in its subpopulations and their cell loss. Moreover, RP genes showed the greatest differential expression in the subpopulations with greater cell perturbation, and we speculated that aberrant expression of these genes might be associated with cell death. In this study, we systematically investigated the changes in the transcriptome profile of brain tissue induced by PMI at single-cell resolution, and revealed one of the important factors that might be responsible for the changes. In addition, our data complemented a possible explanation for the changes in the cellular state of brain tissue induced by postmortem hypoxia-ischemia, and provided a reference for transcriptome studies of RNA degradation samples.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Here we investigated the basis of the polarized bleb morphology of metastatic melanoma cells migrating in non-adhesive confinement. Using high-resolution time-lapse imaging and specific molecular perturbations, we found that EGF signaling via PI3K stabilizes and maintains a polarized leader bleb. Protein activity biosensors revealed a unique EGFR and PI3K activity gradient decreasing from rear-to-front, promoting PIP3 and Rac1-GTP accumulation at the bleb rear, with its antagonists PIP2 and RhoA-GTP concentrated at the bleb tip, opposite to the front-to-rear organization of these signaling modules in integrin-mediated mesenchymal migration. Optogenetic experiments showed that disrupting this gradient caused bleb retraction, underscoring the role of this signaling gradient in bleb stability. Mathematical modeling and experiments identified a mechanism where, as the bleb initiates, CD44 and ERM proteins restrict EGFR mobility in a membrane-apposed cortical actin meshwork in the bleb rear, establishing a rear-to-front EGFR-PI3K-Rac activity gradient. Thus, our study reveals the biophysical and molecular underpinnings of cell polarity in bleb-based migration of metastatic cells in non-adhesive confinement, and underscores how alternative spatial arrangements of migration signaling modules can mediate different migration modes according to the local microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Because these RBD sequences did not match known circulating strains and their source was not known, we termed them ""cryptic lineages"". To date, more than 20 cryptic lineages have been identified using the RBD-focused sequencing strategy. Here, we identified and characterized additional cryptic lineages from SARS-CoV-2 wastewater sequences submitted to NCBIs Sequence Read Archives (SRA). Wastewater sequence datasets were screened for individual sequence reads that contained combinations of mutations frequently found in cryptic lineages but not contemporary circulating lineages. Using this method, we identified 18 cryptic lineages that appeared in multiple samples from the same sewershed, including 12 that were not previously reported. Partial consensus sequences were generated for each cryptic lineage by extracting and mapping sequences containing cryptic-specific mutations. Surprisingly, seven of the mutations that appeared convergently in cryptic lineages were reversions to sequences that were highly conserved in SARS- CoV-2-related bat Sarbecoviruses. The apparent reversion to bat Sarbecovirus sequences suggests that SARS- CoV-2 adaptation to replicate efficiently in respiratory tissues preceded the COVID-19 pandemic.

Author SummaryWastewater surveillance has been used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to monitor viral activity and the spread of viral lineages. Occasionally, SARS-CoV-2 sequences from wastewater reveal unique evolutionary advanced lineages of SARS-CoV-2 from an unknown source, which are termed cryptic lineages. Many groups nationwide also use wastewater surveillance to track the virus and upload that information to NCBIs SRA database. That sequence data was screened to identify 18 cryptic lineages worldwide and identify convergent mutations throughout the genome of multiple cryptic lineages that suggest reversion to residues common in SARS-CoV-2-related Sarbecoviruses.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077

While ML algorithms are proficient in general-purpose tasks, their highly technical nature often hinders their compatibility with the observed biological principles and constraints in the brain, thereby limiting their suitability for neuroscience applications. In this work, we introduce NeuroTorch, a comprehensive ML pipeline specifically designed to assist neuroscientists in leveraging ML techniques using biologically inspired neural network models. NeuroTorch enables the training of recurrent neural networks equipped with either spiking or firing-rate dynamics, incorporating additional biological constraints such as Dales law and synaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance. The pipeline offers various learning methods, including backpropagation through time and eligibility trace forward propagation, aiming to allow neuroscientists to effectively employ ML approaches. To evaluate the performance of NeuroTorch, we conducted experiments on well-established public datasets for classification tasks, namely MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Heidelberg. Notably, NeuroTorch achieved accuracies that replicated the results obtained using the Norse and SpyTorch packages. Additionally, we tested NeuroTorch on real neuronal activity data obtained through volumetric calcium imaging in larval zebrafish. On training sets representing 9.3 minutes of activity under darkflash stimuli from 522 neurons, the mean proportion of variance explained for the spiking and firing-rate neural network models, subject to Dales law, exceeded 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. Our analysis of networks trained on these datasets indicates that both Dales law and spiking dynamics have a beneficial impact on the resilience of network models when subjected to connection ablations. NeuroTorch provides an accessible and well-performing tool for neuroscientists, granting them access to state-of-the-art ML models used in the field without requiring in-depth expertise in computer science.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

We identify a novel role for BORC (BLOC-1-related complex) in segregating SVPs and lysosomal proteins in the cell body. BORC subunit SAM-4/Myrlysin acts through ARL-8 and Kinesin motor proteins UNC-116/KIF5 and UNC-104/KIF1A in segregating SVPs and lysosomal proteins.

LRK-1 recruits SAM-4 that in turn governs the localisation of APB-3 suggesting a hierarchical pathway of LRK-1-SAM-4-APB-3 for the segregation of SVPs and lysosomal proteins. Additionally, we also observe that the size of lysosomal protein-containing compartments (LPCCs) is smaller in SAM-4 and LRK-1. This size regulation depends on UNC-116.

This is evident during brain development, when synaptic plasticity during critical windows enables adaptability to changing environments whilst ensuring the stability of population dynamics. The emergence of population dynamics that balance stability and flexibility during development is poorly understood. Here, we investigated developmental brain dynamics in larval zebrafish, using in vivo 2-photon imaging to record single-cell activity across major brain regions from 3-8 days post-fertilisation, a highly plastic period in which hunting behaviours are established. Our findings revealed region-specific trajectories in the development of such dynamic regimes: the telencephalon exhibited increased neuronal excitability and long-range correlations, alongside the emergence of scale invariant avalanche dynamics indicative of enhanced flexibility. Conversely, while other regions showed increased state transitions over development, the telencephalon demonstrated a surprising rise in state stability, characterized by slightly longer dwell times and drastically reduced angular velocity in state space. Remarkably, such rotationally stable dynamics persisted up to 5 seconds into the future, indicating the emergence of strong attractors supporting stability over long timescales. Notably, we observed that telencephalon dynamics were maintained near to but not at a phase transition, thus allowing for robust responses while remaining adaptable to novel inputs. Our results highlight regionally-specific trajectories in the relationship between flexibility and stability, illustrating how developing neuronal populations can self-organize to balance these competing demands.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

This leads to a state of relative inhibition, reducing feedforward gamma (40-90 Hz) rhythms and spiking to predictable inputs. We refer to this model as predictive routing. It is currently unclear which circuit mechanisms implement this push-pull interaction between alpha/beta and gamma rhythms. To explore how predictive routing is implemented, we developed a self-supervised learning algorithm we call generalized Stochastic Delta Rule (gSDR). It was necessary to develop this learning rule because manual tuning of parameters (frequently used in computational modeling) is inefficient to search through a non-linear parameter space that defines how neuronal rhythms emerge and interact. We used gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits and validated the algorithm on simple tasks, e.g., tuning membrane potentials and firing rates. We next applied gSDR to model observed neurophysiology. We asked the model to reproduce a shift from baseline oscillatory dynamics ([~]<20Hz) to stimulus induced gamma ([~]40-90Hz) dynamics recorded in the macaque monkey visual cortex. This gamma-band oscillation during stimulation emerged by self-modulation of synaptic weights via gSDR. We further showed that the gamma-beta push-pull interactions implied by predictive routing could emerge via stochastic modulation of both local inhibitory circuitry as well as top-down modulatory inputs to a network. To summarize, we implemented gSDR to train biophysical neural circuits based on a series of objectives. gSDR succeeded in implementing these objectives. This revealed the inhibitory neuron mechanisms underlying the gamma-beta push-pull dynamics that are observed during predictive processing tasks in systems and cognitive neuroscience.

Significant StatementThis study contributes to the advancement of self-supervised learning for modeling the behavior of complex neural circuits and specifically, biophysical models based on predictive routing framework. Since gSDR is an evolutionary algorithm and does not rely on specific model-based assumptions, it could improve autonomous approaches both in computational neuroscience and neural network research.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Here, we used brain organoids to investigate this and observed that human axon tracts spend more time growing and extend farther compared to those of mice, independent of their tissue environment. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis pointed to a subset of calcium-permeable ion channels expressed throughout neuron development, including during axon tract outgrowth. Calcium imaging during early neuron development consistently revealed a reduced calcium influx in human neurons compared to mouse neurons. Stimulating calcium influx and increasing cAMP levels resulted in premature halting of axon tract outgrowth and shorter axon tracts, mimicking the mouse phenotype, while abrogating calcium influx led to an even longer phase of axon tract outgrowth and longer axon tracts in humans. Thus, evolutionary differences in calcium regulation set the tempo of neuronal development, by extending the time window to foster the more elaborated human neuron morphology.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

We also used a single reference replicon and complemented it with various Omicron variant Spike proteins to quantify viral entry capabilities in single-round infection assays. Viral entry and RNA replication were negatively correlated, suggesting that as variants evolve reduced entry functions under growing immune pressure on Spike, RNA replication increases as a compensatory mechanism. We identified multiple mutations across the viral genome that enhanced viral RNA replication. NSP6 emerged as a hotspot with a distinct L260F mutation independently arising in the BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.16 variants. Using mutant and revertant NSP6 viral clones, the L260F mutation was validated to enhance viral replication in cells and increase pathogenesis in mice. Notably, this mutation enhanced host lipid droplet consumption by NSP6 without impacting its known ER-zippering function or double-membrane vesicle morphology. Collectively, a systematic analysis of RNA replication of recent Omicron variants defined NSP6s key role in viral RNA replication that provides insight into evolutionary trajectories of recent variants with possible therapeutic implications.

Author SummaryAs SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and adapt in humans, viral variants with enhanced spread and immune evasion have emerged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. While most of the mutations occur in the Spike protein and have been extensively studied, non-Spike mutations have been accumulating and are not as well understood. Here, we constructed Spike-defective genomes of recent Omicron variants and systematically compared their RNA replication capabilities independently from Spike. We also performed single-round infection assays with various Omicron variant Spike proteins to quantify viral entry capabilities. Interestingly, viral entry and RNA replication were negatively correlated, suggesting that as variants evolved reduced entry functions under growing immune pressure on Spike, RNA replication increased as a compensatory mechanism. We focused on a viral protein NSP6 that acquired mutations that significantly enhanced RNA replication. We validated that a frequently accessed L260F mutation in NSP6 enhanced viral infection in cells and increased pathogenesis in mice. While the mutation did not alter NSP6s role in maintaining a membranous network of viral replication factories, the mutation enhanced viral hijacking of the host lipid droplet machinery. Collectively, we highlight the important role of non-Spike mutations in the evolutionary trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 variants with possible monitoring and therapeutic implications.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Methods This was a randomized controlled trial that enrolled physicians and nurses with frontline clinical work during the COVID-19 pandemic and symptoms of depression and burnout. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an 8-week MBSR curriculum alone or an 8-week MBSR curriculum plus group psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) with 25mg psilocybin. Symptoms of depression and burnout were assessed at baseline, and 2-weeks and 6-months post intervention utilizing the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR-16) and Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Professionals (MBI-HSS-MP), respectively. Secondary outcome measures included the Demoralization Scale (DS-II) and the Watts Connectedness Scale (WCS). Adverse events and suicidality were assessed through 6-month follow-up. Results 25 participants were enrolled and randomized. There were 12 study-related AEs recorded that were Grade 1-2 and no serious AEs. There was larger decrease in QIDS score for the MBSR+PAP arm compared to MBSR-only from baseline to 2-weeks post-intervention and significant between-group differences favoring MBSR+PAP on subscales of the MBI-HSS-MP as well as the DS-II and WCS. Conclusions Group psilocybin-assisted therapy plus MBSR was associated with clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms without serious adverse events and with greater reduction in symptoms than MBSR alone. Study findings suggest that integrating psilocybin with mindfulness training may represent a promising treatment for depression and burnout among physicians and nurses.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077

In this vaccine, the Cys538 in the recombinant receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is linked, through a thiosuccinimide linker, to lysine residues of tetanus toxoid (TT) preparation. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that TT is a complex mixture of proteins, similar to other TTs where the detoxified tetanus neurotoxin (d-TeNT) has been shown to be the most abundant protein (30-56%), regardless the quantification method used. The fifteen most abundant proteins account for approximately 78% of the total proteins. LC-MS/MS analysis of the activation process showed that 102 out of 107 lysine residues in the d-TeNT incorporated a maleimide group. In contrast, when tryptic peptides isolated by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography, were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, only 22 Lys residues in the d-TeNT were cross-linked to the RBD C-terminal tryptic peptide (538CVNF541-HHHHHH), probably due to steric hindrance. Twelve and eighteen conjugation sites were assigned based on the identification of linear peptides carrying a conjugated lysine residues ({Delta}m = +1454.58 Da or {Delta}m = +1472.59 Da) and cross-linked peptides with stabilized linker forms, respectively. Eight conjugation sites were coincidently assigned by both strategies. The assignment of the conjugation sites was manually validated by observed regularities (z[&ge;]3+, XIC, immonium ions, specific linker fragment ions) not considered by the identification software (PEAKS, Kojak and pLink2). The RBD was also conjugated, but to a lesser extent, to ten other low abundance carrier proteins.

Gene conversions are thought to occur within relatively short tracts of DNA, estimated to be in the order of 100-1,000 bp in humans. However, the number of observable gene conversion tracts per study has so far been limited by the use of pedigree or sperm-typing data to detect gene conversion events. In this study, we propose a statistical method to estimate the mean length of gene conversion tracts in humans. Our method can handle a large number of gene conversion tracts, leading to more precise estimates of the mean tract length. We apply our method to gene conversion tracts detected in whole autosome sequence data from the UK Biobank using clusters of identity-by-descent segments. From this dataset, we estimate the mean gene conversion tract length in humans to be 459 bp (95% CI: [457, 461]).

We revealed PopZs hierarchical assembly into a filamentous condensate by integrating cryo-electron tomography, biochemistry, single-molecule techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations.

Although these responses often coexist, one can sometimes dominate at the expense of the other. For instance, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a strong cellular immune response but generates a suboptimal neutralizing antibody (nAb) response, hindering viral clearance and enabling persistent infection. Recent findings indicate that this skewed preference toward cellular immunity is determined already during the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. Specifically, subcutaneous (s.c.) LCMV infection predominantly induces T-bet+ T helper 1 (TH1) differentiation while largely neglecting T follicular helper (TFH) differentiation, a key driver of humoral immunity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for this impaired TFH differentiation. We found that T-bet+ cells induced by s.c. LCMV infection are heterogeneous and encompass a terminally differentiated TH1 subset expressing Granzyme-B (GzmB) and a Tcf-1+ subset that retains the potential for TFH differentiation but that does not express CXCR5 and other mature TFH markers. Interestingly, T cell-derived IFN-{gamma} facilitated the proliferation of the GzmB+ subset and inhibited Tcf-1+ cells' progression into TFH. The suppression of TFH cells by IFN-{gamma} was not directly mediated through CD4+ T cells but rather involved another cell type, likely dendritic cells. Consistently, inhibition of IFN-{gamma} enabled robust TFH differentiation, formation of germinal centers and increased antibody production. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms inhibiting nAb production in response to viruses and lays a foundation for the development of advanced vaccine strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

We investigated the roles of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and latent infections in the progression of COVID-19 and sepsis.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective analysis of 97 individuals recovering from mild-to-critical COVID-19 and 64 sepsis patients. Immune cell frequencies, expression of functional markers, and plasma titres of anti-Toxoplasma gondii/cytomegalovirus/BCG antibodies were assessed and their impact on disease severity and outcomes were determined. To examine monocyte responses to secondary challenge, monocytes isolated from COVID-19 convalescent patients, BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated volunteers were stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 and LPS.

ResultsPost COVID-19 patients showed immune dysregulation regardless of disease severity characterized mainly by altered expression of activation and functional markers in myeloid (CD39, CD64, CD85d, CD11b) and lymphoid cells (CD39, CD57, TIGIT). Strikingly, post-critical COVID-19 patients showed elevated expression of CD57 in CD8+ T cells compared to other severity groups. Additionally, a higher frequency of CMV and T. gondii seropositive-alongside a lower frequency of BCG seropositive-patients were associated with severe and critical COVID-19. However, the monocyte response to stimulation was unaffected by the severity of COVID-19.

ConclusionThese findings highlight the long-term alterations of immune cells in post-COVID-19 patients emphasizing the substantial impact of COVID-19 on immune function. However, our data showed no relationship between previous BCG vaccination and protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Water activity (aw) of 0.61 is the lowest aw value for growth of living beings recorded to date. Xerophilic (sometimes called osmophilic) filamentous fungi and yeasts are predominant in high-sugar foods with such low aw values. Some microorganisms are capable of growth at that water activity level. By contrast, high-salt environments are almost exclusively populated by prokaryotes, notably the Halobacteria class and some Bacteroidetes, capable of growing in saturated NaCl (aw 0.75). The lowest aw that can be achieved by the addition of NaCl is 0.75 (saturation point for NaCl). Crystallizer ponds in Li+ concentration plants reach down to water activity levels around 0.1. The aim of this study was to determine how far along the salinity gradient could life be found. Cell counts were attempted by epifluorescence microscopy and qPCR with bacterial and archaeal universal primers. Biomass for DNA extraction was obtained by an optimized protocol involving dialysis of brines previously fixed with ethanol. Prokaryotic diversity was studied by DNA extraction, PCR, qPCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in different ponds along the salinity gradient.

Most of these delicate structures must survive for an organism's lifetime, meaning up to a century in humans. Long-term maintenance and sustained functionality of axons requires motor protein-driven transport distributing life-sustaining materials and organelles to places of need. It seems therefore plausible that loss of motor function can cause axon degeneration; however, also gain-of-function conditions were linked to disorders including motor neuron disease or spastic paraplegia. To understand this phenomenon, we studied ~40 genetic manipulations of motor proteins, cargo linkers and regulators of reactive oxygen species in one standardised Drosophila primary neuron system. Using axonal microtubule bundle organisation as a relevant readout reflecting the state of axon integrity, we found that losses of Dynein heavy chain, KIF1A/Unc-104 and KIF5/Kinesin heavy chain (Khc) all cause bundle disintegration in the form of chaotically curled microtubules. Detailed functional studies of Khc and its adaptor proteins revealed that losses of mitochondrial or lysosomal transport cause ROS dyshomeostasis, which is a condition that inducing MT-curling in fly and mouse neurons alike. We find that hyper-activated Khc induces the same MT-curling phenotype, not through ROS but directly through enhanced mechanical forces. Studies with loss of Unc-104 and expression of an ALS-linked mutant form of the human Khc orthologue KIF5A suggest that the two mechanisms apply to motors beyond Khc. We discuss a model which can explain the surprising common outcome of both conditions and examine its relevance for understanding motor-linked neurodegeneration.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Core genes are traditionally identified by the analysis of amino acid similarities among proteomes, but can also be defined using structures, which bear potential in deep clades beyond the twilight zone of amino acids. Despite breakthroughs in accurate AI-driven protein structure prediction, obtaining full 3D structural models on a proteomic scale is still prohibitively slow. Here, we present Unicore, a novel method for identifying structural core genes at a scale suitable for downstream phylogenetic analysis. By applying the ProstT5 protein language model to the input proteomes to obtain their 3Di structural strings, Unicore saves over three orders of magnitude in runtime compared to a full 3D prediction. Using Foldseek clustering, Unicore identifies single-copy structures universally present in the species and aligns them using Foldmason. These structural core gene alignments are projected back to amino acid information for downstream phylogenetic analysis. We demonstrate that this approach defines core genes with linear run-time scaling over the number of species, up to 56 times faster than OrthoFinder, while reconstructing phylogenetic relationships congruent with conventional approaches.

We then show that during this window, encoding of sensory-motor mismatches is improved, sensory representations are fine-tuned, and predictive signals are more robust. All of these lead to faster and better behavioral responses which are adaptable to current sensory input.

Researchers routinely estimate representational distances from brain-activity measurements that either sparsely sample the underlying neural population (e.g. neural recordings) or pool across the activity of many neurons (e.g. fMRI voxels). Here we use theory and simulations to clarify under what circumstances representational distances estimated from brain-activity measurements reflect the representational geometry of the underlying neural population, and what distortions must be expected under other circumstances. We demonstrate that the estimated representational distances are undistorted if single neurons are sampled at random. For voxels that take non-negatively weighted linear combinations, the resulting geometry is linearly distorted, correctly reflecting the population-mean dimension, while downscaling all orthogonal dimensions, for which the averaging cancels a large portion of the signal. Surprisingly, removing the mean from voxel patterns recovers the underlying representational geometry exactly in expectation under idealized conditions. This explains why the correlation distance, the most popular measure of representational dissimilarity in neuroimaging studies, ""works"" so well, yielding geometries that can appear similar between fMRI and neural recordings. The Euclidean (or Mahalanobis) distance computed after removing the mean of each pattern (without normalizing its variance) is an attractive alternative to the correlation distance in that it corrects for the inflated relative contribution of the population-mean dimension, while avoiding the drawback of the correlation distance: it can be large for confusable low-norm patterns, failing to reflect decodability. Our results demonstrate that measured representational distances reflect the neural representational geometry when (1) single neurons are sampled at random or (2) the weights with which the measured responses sample the neurons are drawn i.i.d. and (2a) the weights are drawn from a zero-mean distribution or (2b) the population mean is the same for all conditions or (2c) the mean is removed from each estimated pattern.

The interaction between CO2 and drought affects the concentrations of many nutrients in crops, often resulting in excessive agrochemical use and less nutritious food production. To address these challenges, we investigated nutrient dynamics in Brachypodium distachyon, a model crop plant, under ambient and elevated CO2, factorially combined with well-watered or drought treatments. Integrative analyses of plant physiology, transcriptomics, and machine learning-enabled non-targeted metabolomics revealed that plant elemental composition and metabolomic responses to elevated CO2 strongly depend on water availability and differ between shoots and roots. Elevated CO2 and drought significantly impaired nitrogen status, with root nitrate uptake being more negatively affected than ammonium uptake. However, elevated CO2 increased iron partitioning in shoots under drought, potentially driven by enhanced carbon availability facilitating chelator synthesis for iron translocation. The high accumulation of sphingolipids in roots under combined stresses suggests a protective role against ionome imbalances. These findings highlight how climate stressors interact to shape plant nutrient dynamics, providing insights that can guide agricultural practices and breeding strategies to optimize nutrient management and foster sustainable agriculture under changing climate.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Emerging work suggests that the thalamus, the relay center of the brain that undergoes secondary damage after cortical TBI, is involved with heightened seizure risks after TBI. TBI also induces the recruitment of peripheral immune cells, including T cells, to the site(s) of injury, but it is unclear how these cells impact neurological sequelae post-TBI. Here, we characterize the identities and kinetics of lymphocytic infiltrates into the cortex and thalamus using a mouse model of cortical TBI. We identify a population of IFN{gamma}-producing type 1 lymphocytes that infiltrate specific thalamic subregions over weeks following injury, where they elicit a local IFN{gamma} response in microglia and neuronal subset(s). Depletion of CD4+ T cells protects mice from TBI-induced seizure susceptibility by de-repressing other non-CD4+ type 1 lymphocytes and disease-associated microglia (DAMs) in the thalamus. Strikingly, we find that a single dose of IFN{gamma} prior to challenge with a proconvulsant agent was sufficient to reduce TBI-induced seizure incidence, severity, and mortality. This work identifies IFN{gamma} as a direct modulator of TBI-associated seizure susceptibility, which could have therapeutic implications for the treatment of TBI patients.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

We hypothesized that a previous history of IBDV in chickens would render them more susceptible to infection by influenza A viruses (IAVs) from aquatic waterfowl reservoirs. To model this, we inoculated 14 day old specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens with a low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strain from a mallard (A/Mallard/Alberta/156/01 (H3N8)) and compared replication and shedding between immunocompetent chickens and chickens that had immune dysregulation due to a prior IBDV infection with strain F52/70 (genogroup A1B1) at 2 days of age. The mallard IAV strain replicated in the upper respiratory tract of the chickens, and virus was shed from the oropharyngeal cavity, but there was no shedding from the cloaca, and no transmission to sentinel chickens. Replication of the mallard IAV in the chicken host was associated with amino acid substitutions in the polymerase complex and HA. IBDV infection increased the average fold change of IAV replication in the trachea of chickens, prolonged the shedding of infectious IAV from 5 to 6 days in some chickens, increased the number of amino acid substitutions detected in the IAV population from 13 to 30, and significantly increased the number of mutations per IAV sample from 2.50 (SD +/- 1.83) in the Mock/IAV group to 4.75 (SD +/- 1.81) in the IBDV/IAV group (p < 0.01).

However, the composition and function of protist-associated microbiomes remains largely elusive. Here, we employ cultivation-independent single-cell isolation and genome-resolved metagenomics to provide detailed insights into underexplored microbiomes and viromes of over 100 currently uncultivable ciliates and amoebae isolated from diverse environments. Our findings reveal unique microbiome compositions and hint at an intricate network of complex interactions and associations with bacterial symbionts and viruses. We observed stark differences between ciliates and amoebae in terms of microbiome and virome compositions, highlighting the specificity of protist-microbe interactions. Over 115 of the recovered microbial genomes were affiliated with known endosymbionts of eukaryotes, including diverse members of the Holosporales, Rickettsiales, Legionellales, Chlamydiae, Dependentiae, and more than 250 were affiliated with possible host-associated bacteria of the phylum Patescibacteria. We also identified more than 80 giant viruses belonging to diverse viral lineages, of which some were actively expressing genes in single cell transcriptomes, suggesting a possible association with the sampled protists. We also revealed a wide range of other viruses that were predicted to infect eukaryotes or host-associated bacteria. Our results provide further evidence that protists serve as mediators of complex microbial and viral associations, playing a critical role in ecological networks. The frequent co-occurrence of giant viruses and diverse microbial symbionts in our samples suggests multipartite associations, particularly among amoebae. Our study provides a preliminary assessment of the microbial diversity associated with lesser-known protist lineages and paves the way for a deeper understanding of protist ecology and their roles in environmental and human health.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Here, we introduce RNAGenesis, a foundation model that combines RNA sequence understanding and de novo design through latent diffusion. With a Bert-like Transformer encoder with Hybrid N-Gram tokenization for encoding, a Query Transformer for latent space compression, and an autoregressive decoder for sequence generation, RNAGenesis reconstructs RNA sequences from learned representations. Specifically for the generation, a score-based denoising diffusion model is trained to capture the latent distribution of RNA sequences. RNAGenesis outperforms current methods in RNA sequence understanding, achieving the best results in 9 of 13 benchmarks (especially in RNA structure prediction), and further excels in designing natural-like aptamers and optimized CRISPR sgRNAs with desirable properties.

Traditionally, iterative enzymes install multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) on linear peptides, rather than mature RiPPs with intricate three-dimensional structures, which would require complex changes in substrate binding poses. Here, we present a prolific class of GCN5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNATs) that iteratively and consecutively acylate two Lys residues within the loop and ring motifs of lasso peptides, diverging from the typical iterative modification of linear peptides, an unprecedented function for PTM enzymes. Utilizing high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy and enzymatic reconstitution, we mapped the lasso peptide binding pocket of IatT and pinpointed key residues involved in demarcating the two distinct acetylation steps. Structure-based engineering of IatT's acetyl group recognition site expanded the cavity to accommodate longer-chain acyl groups, leading to the creation of lipolasso peptides, a novel class of ribosomal lipopeptide. This engineering strategy can be applied to any RiPP BGC encoding GNAT, facilitating the efficient diversification of rare ribosomal lipopeptides.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Cannulae have been postulated to act as a primitive extracellular matrix through which cells could communicate or exchange material, although their native biological function remains obscure. Here, we report cryoEM structural analyses of ex vivo cannulae and of in vitro protein assemblies derived from recombinant cannula-like proteins. Three-dimensional reconstructions of P. abyssi cannulae revealed that the structural interactions between protomers in the native and recombinant filaments were based on donor strand complementation, a form of non-covalent polymerization in which a donor {beta}-strand from one subunit is inserted into an acceptor groove in a {beta}-sheet of a neighboring subunit. Donor strand complementation in cannulae is reinforced through calcium ion coordination at the interfaces between structural subunits in the respective assemblies. While donor strand complementation occurs during the assembly of chaperone-usher pili, this process requires the participation of accessory proteins that are localized in the outer membrane. In contrast, we demonstrate that calcium ions can induce assembly of cannulae in the absence of other co-factors. Crystallographic analysis of a recombinant cannula-like protein monomer provided evidence that calcium ion binding primes the precursor for donor strand invasion through unblocking of the acceptor groove. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that structurally homologous cannula-like proteins occurred within the genomes of other hyperthermophilic archaea and were encompassed within the TasA superfamily of biomatrix proteins. CryoEM structural analyses of tubular filaments derived from in vitro assembly of a recombinant cannula-like protein from an uncultured Hyperthermus species revealed a common mode of assembly to the Pyrodictium cannulae, in which donor strand complementation and calcium ion binding stabilized longitudinal and lateral assembly in tubular 2D sheets.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077

Here we report tissue-specific ad-aptations at the NMJ when MCI is depleted. In Drosophila motor neurons, MCI depletion causes profound cytological defects and increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). But in-stead of diminishing synapse function, neuronal ROS triggers a homeostatic signaling process that maintains normal NMJ excitation. We identify molecules mediating this compensatory response. MCI depletion in muscles also enhances local ROS. But high levels of muscle ROS cause destruc-tive responses: synapse degeneration, mitochondrial fragmentation, and impaired neurotransmis-sion. In humans, mutations affecting MCI subunits cause severe neurological and neuromuscular diseases. The tissue-level effects that we describe in the Drosophila system are potentially relevant to forms of mitochondrial pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Changes in astrocyte function contribute to depressive-like behaviors. However, while neuronal mechanisms driving MDD have been studied in some detail, molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes promote depression have not been extensively explored. To uncover astrocyte contributions to MDD, we subjected male mice to chronic social defeat stress precipitated by encounters with a dominant male. Animals exposed to this treatment exhibit symptoms indicative of MDD, including reduced social interactions, anxiety, despair, and anhedonia. We then measured astrocyte translating mRNA expression changes in mice that underwent chronic social defeat and control animals using ribosome affinity purification. Bioinformatic analyses reveal significant alterations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), consistent with previous studies implicating this brain region in MDD. Expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, cell-cell interaction proteins, and proteins controlling glutamatergic synaptic function are significantly altered. These changes correlate with perturbation of glutamatergic transmission, measured by electrophysiology, and increased synaptic cleft size. Among ECM genes, increased expression of mRNA encoding the synaptic remodeling protein secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (Sparc) correlates the most with the depressive phenotype. Furthermore, presence of SPARC and other ECM proteins in synaptosomes is also increased and overexpressing Sparc in PFC partially alleviates stress symptoms. Our results raise the possibility that increased expression of Sparc may be a natural protective mechanism against stress-induced synaptic dysfunction in depression.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Identifying active ingredients requires access to detailed intervention descriptions, such as from trial protocols or manuals. We conducted a large-scale survey of the accessibility of trial protocols or manuals for evidence-based psychological interventions, tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for multiple mental disorders.

MethodsWe assembled a large cohort of RCTs, selecting these from six large network meta-analyses of psychological interventions for severe mental disorders (schizophrenia and other psychotic, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa). For each trial and active intervention arm, we used a multipronged approach (published protocol, trial registries, author contact, commercial availability) to identify protocols or manuals. We described, by trial and by active intervention arm, the proportion for which protocols or manuals were (1) accessible, i.e., retrievable by any method, and (2) publicly available.

FindingsWe included 260 RCTs, with 401 active intervention arms. Of these, 20 RCTs (8%, 95% confidence interval/CI 5% to 12%) were associated to protocols, published separately or as supplement. For the remaining 240 trials, we contacted 450 authors. Authors shared protocols for 43 trials (18%, 95% CI 13% to 23%), refused to share for 73 (30%, 95% CI 25% to 37%) and did not respond for 101 (42%, 95% CI 36% to 49%). Protocols or manuals were retrievable for 318 (79%, 95% CI 75% to 83%) and publicly available for 88 (22%, 95% CI 18% to 26%) active intervention arms, respectively.

ConclusionsAccess to detailed descriptions of psychological interventions, even using multiple methods, is difficult and burdensome, hampering much-needed examinations of treatment components. Relying only on open-access resources and sharing from authors, a researcher would be able to access about one third of trial protocols or manuals. Improving dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments requires publicly available treatment manuals.

While this period of beta cell dysfunction is well established, its cause and underlying mechanism remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, live human pancreas tissue slices were prepared from autoantibody- negative organ donors without diabetes (ND), donors positive for one or more islet autoantibodies (AAb+), and donors with T1D within 0-4 years of diagnosis (T1D+). Dynamic imaging and physiological secretion studies were conducted to assess the extent and impact of T cell infiltration on beta cell function through immunolabeling, Ca2+ imaging, and perifusion assays for insulin secretion. Beta cells were identified in living slices by ENTPD3 cell surface staining. Beta cells from both ND and AAb+ donors exhibited normal cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization in response to high glucose and KCl. Beta cells from donors with T1D had significantly diminished Ca2+ responses to high glucose but preserved responses to KCl. In T1D, glucose responsiveness was impaired in both T cell-infiltrated and non-infiltrated insulin positive islets, supporting the concept that beta cell dysfunction is independent of close spatial association between beta cells and T cells. Fixed tissue staining and gene expression profiling of laser-capture microdissected islets revealed significant decreases in markers of glucose metabolism to ATP in beta cells from donors with T1D but no changes in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers.

Additionally, these beta cell metabolic defects contribute to the clinical manifestation of dysglycemia at T1D diagnosis despite a remaining mass of beta cells.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Previous studies have identified an interbacterial toxin predicted to exhibit proteolytic activity that is broadly distributed among Gram-negative bacteria. However, the precise mechanism of intoxication remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that one such protease toxin from Escherichia coli, Cpe1, disrupts DNA replication and segregation by recognizing and cleaving conserved sequences in the essential type II DNA topoisomerases GyrB and ParE. Cpe1 belongs to the papain-like cysteine protease family and is associated with toxin delivery pathways, including the type VI secretion system and contact-dependent growth inhibition. The crystal structure of Cpe1 in complex with its immunity protein reveals a neutralization mechanism involving competitive substrate binding rather than active site occlusion, distinguishing it from previously characterized effector-immunity pairs. Collectively, our findings unveil a unique mode of interbacterial intoxication and provide insights into how bacteria protect themselves from self-poisoning by protease toxins.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

However, there is no universally accepted or applied statistical test to analyze the performance of these circuits. Many basic statistical tests fail to capture the predicted logic (OR, AND, etc.) and most studies neglect statistical analysis entirely. As synthetic gene circuits shift toward advanced applications, primarily in computing, biosensing, and human health, it is critical to standardize the statistical methods used to evaluate gate success. Here, we propose the application of a linear mixed effects model to analyze and quantify genetic Boolean logic gate performance. First, we analyzed 144 currently published Boolean logic gates for trends and used unsupervised machine learning (k-means clustering) to validate the statistical model. Next, we utilized the model to generate estimates for the fixed effect of the ON state, {beta}, as a general descriptor of the Boolean nature of a circuit and used Monte Carlo simulations to recommend sample sizes for evaluating gate performance. Finally, we examined {beta} as a holistic metric for circuit performance using a series of nested repressor OR gates with intentionally degraded performance. We observed a linear correlation between {beta} and the predicted translation rate, highlighting the use of {beta} for the forward design of new Boolean gates. In summary, we utilized a linear mixed effects model to describe synthetic gene circuits and determined that the fixed effect, {beta}, is an appropriate descriptor of gate behavior that can be used to statistically evaluate performance.

Significance statementThere is no standard method for statistically evaluating the success of biological Boolean logic gates and common statistical tests are not used or incorrectly applied. We propose the use of a linear mixed effects model to estimate the value for {beta}, a parameter which describes the difference between ON and OFF gate states. A null hypothesis of {beta} = 0 can then be tested to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two states.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

When recognized by host immune receptors, these proteins become avirulence (AVR) effectors. Several sequence-diverse AVRPM3 effectors and the suppressor of AVRPM3-PM3 recognition (SVRPM3a1/f1) are involved in triggering allele-specific, Pm3-mediated resistance, but the molecular mechanisms controlling their function in the host cell remain unknown. Here, we describe that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 form homo- and heteromeric complexes with each other, suggesting they are present as dimers in the host cell. Alphafold2 modelling substantiated previous predictions that AVRPM3b2/c2, AVRPM3a2/f2 and SVRPM3a1/f1 all adopt a core RNase-like fold. We found that a single amino acid mutation in a predicted surface exposed region of AVRPM3a2/f2 resulted in recognition by the PM3b immune receptor, which does not recognize wildtype AVRPM3a2/f2. This indicates that differential AVRPM3 recognition by variants of the highly related PM3 immune receptors is due to subtle differences in similar protein surfaces of sequence-diverse AVRs. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which homodimers of AVRPM3s are recognized by their corresponding PM3 variants and that heterodimer formation with SVRPM3a1/f1 allows for evasion of recognition.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Nevertheless, condensates have been shown to interact with lipid membranes in diverse biological processes, such as autophagy and T-cell activation. Since many condensates are known to have a net surface charge density and associated electric potential(s), we hypothesized that they can induce a local membrane potential. Using an electrochromic dye, we demonstrate that poly-lysine/ATP condensates induce a localized membrane potential in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles. This effect diminishes with increasing salt concentration and higher ATP-to-poly-lysine ratios, underscoring the key role of condensate charge. Numerical modeling of the condensate-membrane interface using an electro-thermodynamic framework supports our experimental findings and highlights parameters expected to play a key role in the effect. These results have broad implications for biological processes regulated by membrane potential, particularly in contexts such as neuronal signaling, where condensate interactions with membranes may play a previously unrecognized regulatory role.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

However, little is known about how the brain may reconcile the ability to produce hardwired responses essential to survival while still allowing for adaptive flexibility. Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses, an innate predator-evasion behaviour, can be robustly extinguished via repeated unreinforced presentation over several days. We report that this extinction is long-lasting and generalises to other contexts, but can be rapidly recovered via the pairing of the visual stimulus with an aversive electric foot-shock stimulus. Moreover, fiber photometric recordings reveal that this behavioural paradigm results in the attenuation of SC and PAG physiological responses to visual looming stimuli, and that these responses do not recover following recovery of behavioural responses. An analysis of c-Fos expression patterns throughout the midbrain and hippocampus uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned visual looming fear responses. We investigate the functional significance of this vCA1 ensemble and report that, while its activity is not necessary for innate defensive behaviour, it is necessary for learned fear responses. Together, these findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in enabling adaptive behavioural responses to the innately threatening visual looming stimulus which acts in complement with innate circuitry of the SC and PAG.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Metastatic spreading correlates with tumor cell state evolution. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying metastasis remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the quantitative dosage of oncogenic KRAS drives lung adenocarcinoma progression and metastasis via the integration of external signaling and pioneer transcription factor dynamics into qualitative cell states. Combining mouse models, in vivo CRISPR activation screens, and fate mapping, we show that even mild transcriptional amplification of KRAS significantly fuels tumor progression and metastasis. Chromatin profiling and transcriptomics reveal that high and low KRAS dosages supersede and integrate inflammatory and TGF{beta} signaling to dictate mouse cancer cell states. Patient data show that KRAS dosages correlate with distinct survival outcomes, transcription factor activity, and cell states. Direct KRAS inhibition in xenografts limits the KRAS-high ""proliferative"" cell state but spares a minimal residual state mimicking the KRAS-low ""ciliated-like"" state. Thus, oncogenic KRAS dosage fuels tumor heterogeneity at the cell state level and drives a bimodal tumor evolution during metastasis, with implications for prognosis and treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

This super admixture model provides a one-to-one mapping in terms of probability moments with the population-level kinship model, the latter of which is a general model of genome-wide relatedness and structure based on identity-by-descent. We introduce a method to estimate the super admixture model that is based on method of moments, does not rely on likelihoods, is computationally efficient, and scales to massive sample sizes. We apply the method to several human data sets and show that the admixed populations are indeed substantially related, implying the proposed method captures a new and important component of evolutionary history and structure in the admixture model. We show that the fitted super admixture model estimates relatedness between all pairs of individuals at a resolution similar to the kinship model.

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 alters the host metabolism may lead to treatments for COVID-19. We report that a ubiquitous gaseous molecule, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), regulates redox, metabolism, and mitochondrial bioenergetics to control SARS-CoV-2. Virus replication is associated with down-regulation of the H2S-producing enzymes cystathionine-{beta}-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-{gamma}-lyase (CTH), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), resulting in diminished endogenous H2S levels. Inhibition of CTH resulted in SARS-CoV-2 proliferation. A slow-releasing H2S donor, GYY4137, diminished virus replication by inducing Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, restoring redox balance and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals with GYY4137 suppressed viral replication, ameliorated respiratory pathology, and restored antioxidant gene expression. Notably, whole-body plethysmography showed improved pulmonary function variables, including pulmonary obstruction and end-expiratory pause upon GYY4137 treatment in vivo.

In North America, infections in novel avian and mammalian species suggest the potential for changing ecology and establishment of new animal reservoirs. Outbreaks among domestic birds have persisted despite aggressive culling, necessitating a re-examination of how these outbreaks were sparked and maintained. To recover how these viruses were introduced and disseminated in North America, we analyzed 1,818 Hemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences sampled from North American wild birds, domestic birds and mammals from November 2021-September 2023 using Bayesian phylodynamic approaches. Using HA, we infer that the North American panzootic was driven by [~]8 independent introductions into North America via the Atlantic and Pacific Flyways, followed by rapid dissemination westward via wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, shorebirds, and Galliformes, while species such as songbirds, raptors, and owls mostly acted as dead-end hosts. Unlike the epizootic of 2015, outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by [~]46-113 independent introductions from wild birds, with some onward transmission. Backyard birds were infected [~]10 days earlier on average than birds in commercial poultry production settings, suggesting that they could act as ""early warning signals"" for transmission upticks in a given area. Our findings support wild birds as an emerging reservoir for HPAI transmission in North America and suggest continuous surveillance of wild Anseriformes and shorebirds as crucial for outbreak inference. Future prevention of agricultural outbreaks may require investment in strategies that reduce transmission at the wild bird/agriculture interface, and investigation of backyard birds as putative early warning signs.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

The inter-family structural clustering successfully grouped CAZy families and clans with the same structural folds in the same subclasses. The intra-family structural clustering classified structurally similar CAZymes into SCs, which were further classified into SC groups. SCs and SC groups differed from sequence similarity-based CAZy subfamilies.

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077

From the first COVID-19 case detected through March 25, 2022, 66,684 of 196,652 residents of Californias state prison system were infected, most of them in two large winter waves of outbreaks that reached all 35 of the state prisons. We used individual-level data on disease timing and nightly room assignments in these prisons to reconstruct locations and pathways of transmission statistically, and from that estimated reproduction numbers, locations of unobserved infection events, and the subsequent magnitude and distribution of long COVID prevalence. Where earlier work has recommended smaller cells over large dormitory housing to reduce transmission, recommended use of cells with solid doors over those with bars only, and cautioned against reliance on solid doors (e.g., in cold months when HVAC systems can circulate aerosols), we found evidence of substantial transmission in both dorms and cells regardless of the door and season. Effective reproduction numbers were found to range largely between 0 and 5, in both cells and dorms of all door types. Our estimates of excess case rates suggest that as a result of disparities in incarceration, prison outbreaks contributed to disproportionate disease burden on Black and Indigenous people in California. We estimated that 9,100-11,000 people have developed long COVID as a result of infection in these prison outbreaks, 1,700-2,000 of them with disabling consequences, and that this burden is disproportionately on Black and Indigenous people in comparison to the state as a whole.

Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

The inherently dim fluorescence and low signal-to-noise ratio of red-shifted GECIs have posed significant challenges. More critically, several red-fluorescent GECIs exhibit photoswitching when exposed to blue light, thereby limiting their applicability in all- optical experimental approaches. Here, we present the development of PinkyCaMP, the first mScarlet-based Ca2+ sensor that outperforms current red fluorescent sensors in brightness, photostability, signal-to-noise ratio, and compatibility with optogenetics and neurotransmitter imaging. PinkyCaMP is well-tolerated by neurons, showing no toxicity or aggregation, both in vitro and in vivo. All imaging approaches, including single-photon excitation methods such as fiber photometry, widefield imaging, miniscope imaging, as well as two-photon imaging in awake mice, are fully compatible with PinkyCaMP.","NA","biorxiv",1735855688077

Here, we introduce Genomic Network Analysis (GNA), an analytic framework that applies the principles of network modelling to estimates of genetic overlap derived from genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics. The result is a genomic network that describes the conditionally independent genetic associations between traits that remain when controlling for shared signal with the broader network of traits. Graph theory metrics provide added insight by formally quantifying the most important traits in the genomic network. GNA can discover additional trait-specific pathways by incorporating gene expression or genetic variants into the network to estimate their conditional associations with each trait. Extensive simulations establish GNA is well-powered for most GWAS. Application to a diverse set of traits demonstrate that GNA yields critical insight into the genetic architecture that demarcate genetically overlapping traits at varying levels of biological granularity.","NA","medrxiv",1735855688077
