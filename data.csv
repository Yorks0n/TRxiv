In addition to impacting poultry, these HPAI viruses caused mortality events in wild bird species and wild mammals. Transmission in multiple host species raises the concern for mammalian adaptation. On March 25, 2024, HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed in a dairy cow in Texas in response to a multi-state investigation into milk production losses. Over one hundred positive herds were rapidly identified in Texas and eleven other U.S. states. The case description included reduced feed intake and rumen motility in lactating cows, decreased milk production, and thick yellow milk. The diagnostic investigation revealed detections of viral RNA in milk and mammary tissue with alveolar epithelial degeneration and necrosis, and positive immunoreactivity of glandular epithelium by immunohistochemistry. A single transmission event, likely from avian species to dairy cattle, followed by limited local transmission preceded the onward lateral transmission of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b genotype B3.13. We sought to experimentally reproduce infection with genotype B3.13 in Holstein yearling heifers and lactating cows. The heifers were inoculated by an aerosol respiratory route and the cows by an intramammary route. Clinical disease was mild in the heifers, but infection was confirmed by virus detection, lesions, and seroconversion. Clinical disease in lactating cows included decreased rumen motility, changes to milk appearance, and production losses consistent with field reports of viral mastitis. Infection was confirmed by high levels of viral RNA detected in milk, virus isolation, lesions in mammary tissue, and seroconversion. This study provides the foundation to investigate additional routes of infection, transmission, and intervention strategies.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Patient-reported outcome measures were collected at baseline, after treatment and at 3-month follow up. The primary outcome measures were the mental and physical component score (MCS/PCS) of the SF-36 questionnaire 3 months after HBOT. A clinically relevant positive or negative response was defined as an increase or decrease of [&ge;]10% in MCS and/or PCS after 3 months.

Despite advancements in imaging technology, achieving accurate cell tracking remains challenging, particularly in complex and crowded tissues where cell segmentation is often ambiguous. We present Ultrack, a versatile and scalable cell-tracking method that tackles this challenge by considering candidate segmentations derived from multiple algorithms and parameter sets. Ultrack employs temporal consistency to select optimal segments, ensuring robust performance even under segmentation uncertainty. We validate our method on diverse datasets, including terabyte-scale developmental time-lapses of zebrafish, fruit fly, and nematode embryos, as well as multi-color and label-free cellular imaging. We show that Ultrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Cell Tracking Challenge and demonstrates superior accuracy in tracking densely packed embryonic cells over extended periods. Moreover, we propose an approach to tracking validation via dual-channel sparse labeling that enables high-fidelity ground truth generation, pushing the boundaries of long-term cell tracking assessment. Our method is freely available as a Python package with Fiji and napari plugins and can be deployed in a high-performance computing environment, facilitating widespread adoption by the research community.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Prior to moulting, epidermal tissue peels off from the old cuticle and grows non-uniformly to shape protruding appendages, which are often branching, curving, or twisting, from the planar epidermis. This non-uniform growth is possibly regulated by the distribution of morphogens on the epidermal cell sheet. Previous studies have identified molecules and signalling pathways related to such morphogenesis; however, how local regulation of cell sheet growth can transform planar epidermis globally into complex three-dimensional structures, such as beetle horns, remains unclear. To reveal the relationship between epidermal growth regulation and generated structures, this study theoretically examined how various shapes can be generated from planar epidermis under a deductive growth model that corresponds morphogen distributions to non-uniform growth on tissue. The results show that the heterochronic expression of multiple morphogens can flexibly fuse multiple simple shapes to generate various structures emulating complex appendages of beetles. These findings indicate that morphogenesis through such a mechanism may have developmental stability and modularity, providing insights into the evolution of the diverse morphology of arthropods.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Surprisingly, the strongest relationship was between developmental noise and macroevolutionary divergence-levels thought to be the most distant-whereas the relationship between standing genetic variation and population divergence was modest, despite established theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that the congruence of developmental system with long-term history of fluctuation in adaptive peaks creates dialectical relationships between microevolution and macroevolution.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

This process requires learning the states of the world as well as the transitional relationships between those states. The hippocampal cognitive map is believed to be one such internal model. However, evidence for predictive coding and reward sensitivity in the hippocampal neuronal representation suggests that its role extends beyond purely spatial representation. In fact, it raises the question of what kind of spatial representation is most useful for learning and maximizing future rewards? Here, we track the evolution of reward representation over weeks as mice learn to solve a cognitively demanding reward-based task. Our findings reveal a highly organized restructuring of hippocampal reward representations during the learning process. Specifically, we found multiple lines of evidence, both at the population and single-cell levels, that hippocampal representation becomes predictive of reward over weeks. Namely, both population-level information about reward and the percentage of reward-tuned neurons decrease over time. At the same time, the representation of the animals' choice and reward approach period (the period between choice and reward) increased over time. By tracking individual reward cells across sessions, we found that neurons initially tuned for reward shifted their tuning towards choice and reward approach periods, indicating that reward cells backpropagate their tuning to anticipate reward with experience. These findings underscore the dynamic nature of hippocampal representations, highlighting their critical role in learning through the prediction of future outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Here, we show that a gut-brain-gut circuit loop gates sugar ingestion in flies. We discovered that brain neurons regulating food ingestion, IN1 8 , receive excitatory input from enteric sensory neurons, which innervate the oesophagus and express the sugar receptor Gr43a. These enteric sensory neurons monitor the sugar content of food within the oesophagus during ingestion and send positive feedback signals to IN1s, stimulating the consumption of high-sugar foods. Connectome analyses reveal that IN1s form a core ingestion circuit. This interoceptive circuit receives synaptic input from enteric afferents and provides synaptic output to enteric motor neurons, which modulate the activity of muscles at the entry segments of the crop, a stomach-like food storage organ. While IN1s are persistently activated upon ingestion of sugar-rich foods, enteric motor neurons are continuously inhibited, causing the crop muscles to relax and enabling flies to consume large volumes of sugar. Our findings reveal a key interoceptive mechanism that underlies the rapid sensory monitoring and motor control of sugar ingestion within the digestive tract, optimising the diet of flies across varying metabolic states.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

The existence of this interaction suggests that the neurotransmitter release machinery can regulate electrical signalling directly, and therefore modulate the threshold for its own activity. We further find that reduction of NALCN currents is sufficient to promote cell survival in syntaxin-depleted cells. This suggests that disinhibited NALCN may cause the puzzling phenomenon of rapid neuronal cell death in the absence of syntaxin. This interaction may offer opportunities for future drug development against genetic diseases linked to both NALCN- and SNARE protein-containing complexes.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Nevertheless, studies on the effectiveness of various tVNS protocols have produced heterogeneous results on pupil dilatation to date. Here, we synthesize the existing evidence and compare conventional continuous and pulsed stimulation protocols using Bayesian meta-analysis. To maintain a living version, we developed a Shiny App with the possibility to incorporate newly published studies in the future. Based on a systematic review, we included 18 studies (N = 771) applying either continuous or pulsed stimulation protocols. Across studies, we found anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis that tVNS increases pupil size (g = 0.14, 95% CI = [0.001, 0.29], BF01 = 2.5). Separating studies according to continuous vs. pulsed protocols revealed that results were driven by studies using pulsed taVNS (strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis: g = 0.34, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.53], BF10 = 14.15) while continuous tVNS provided strong evidence for the null hypothesis (g = 0.01, CI = [-0.15, 0.16], BF01= 20.7). In conclusion, our meta-analysis highlights differential effects of continuous and pulsed tVNS protocols on pupil dilation. These findings underscore the relevance of tVNS protocols in optimizing its use for specific applications that may require modulation of tonic vs. phasic monoaminergic responses.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

We isolated satellite cells from eel muscle tissue to establish a foundation for cultured eel meat production. While initial cell cultures contained myoblasts, continued passaging led to a decline in myoblast characteristics and an increase in fibroblast-like cells. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR analyses showed significant downregulation of well-established markers for satellite cells and myoblasts, such as pax7a and myoD, over successive passages, highlighting a loss of myoblastic traits. Single-cell cloning was employed to overcome this challenge and maintain myoblast purity, leading to the successful creation of the JEM1129 cell line. These JEM1129 cells demonstrated enhanced expression of myoblast marker genes, exceeding the initial primary culture cell population. The cells showed strong myotube formation, particularly when cultured in a differentiation medium, indicating their robust potential for muscle development. The JEM1129 cell line represents a significant advancement in the cultivation of eel muscle cells, offering a promising avenue for cultured meat production. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of muscle cell biology and provide valuable insights into using fish-derived myoblasts for cultured meat production.

This screen, coupled with orthogonal secondary assays, revealed pan-fibril binding chemotypes, as well as fluoroprobes selective for subsets of fibrils. One fluoroprobe recognized tau pathology in ex vivo brain slices from Alzheimers disease patients. We propose that these scaffolds represent entry points for development of selective fibril ligands and, more broadly, that high throughput, fluorescence-based dye screening is a platform for their discovery.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Intracellular concentrations of cdG are controlled by the interplay of diguanylate cyclase (DGC) enzymes, which synthesize cdG to promote biofilms, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes, which hydrolyse cdG to drive motility. To track the complete regulatory logic of how V. cholerae responds to changing cdG levels, we followed a timecourse of overexpression of either the V. harveyi diguanylate cyclase QrgB or a variant of QrgB lacking catalytic activity (QrgB*). We find that QrgB increases cdG levels relative to QrgB* for 30 minutes after overexpression, but the effect of QrgB on cdG levels plateaus at 30 minutes, indicating tight adaptive control of cdG levels. In contrast, loss of VpsR, a master regulator activating biofilm formation upon binding to cdG, leads to higher baseline levels of cdG and continuously increasing cdG through 60 minutes after QrgB induction, revealing the existence of a negative feedback loop on cdG levels operating through VpsR. Through a combination of RNA polymerase ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, and genetic approaches, we show that transcription of a gene encoding a PDE, cdgC, is activated by VpsR at high cdG concentrations, mediating this negative feedback on cdG levels. We further identify a transcript encoded within, and antisense to, the cdgC open reading frame which we name sRNA negative regulator of CdgC (SnrC). RNA polymerase ChIP-seq and RNA-seq demonstrate SnrC to be expressed specifically under conditions of high cdG in the absence of VpsR. Ectopic SnrC expression increases cdG levels in a manner dependent on CdgC, demonstrating that its effect on cdG levels is likely through interference with CdgC production. Further, although cells lacking cdgC exhibit enhanced biofilm formation, these mutants are outcompeted by wild type V. cholerae in colonization assays that reward a combination of attachment, dispersal, and motility behaviors. These results underscore the importance of negative feedback regulation of cdG to maintain appropriate homeostatic levels for efficient transitioning between biofilm formation and motility, both of which are necessary over the course of the V. cholerae infection cycle.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Despite their prevalence, the identity of the transporters required for distribution of these herbicides in plants is both poorly understood and the subject of controversial debate 3,4. Here we show that PIN-FORMED auxin transporters transport a range of phenoxyacetic acid herbicides across the membrane and we characterize the molecular determinants of this process using a variety of different substrates as well as protein mutagenesis to control substrate specificity. Finally, we present Cryo-EM structures of Arabidopsis thaliana PIN8 with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (4-CPA) bound. These structures represent five key states from the transport cycle, allowing us to describe conformational changes associated with substrate binding and transport across the membrane. Overall, our results reveal that phenoxyacetic acid herbicides use the same export machinery as endogenous auxins and exemplify how transporter binding sites undergo transformations that dictate substrate specificity. These results enable development of novel synthetic auxins and for guiding precision breeding of herbicide resistant crop plants.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635633

Unlike for small-molecule catalysts, the structural ensembles of enzymes can vary substantially with temperature, and it is in general unclear how this modulates the temperature dependence of activity. Here multi-temperature X-ray crystallography was used to record structural changes from -20{degrees}C to 40{degrees}C for a mesophilic enzyme in complex with inhibitors mimicking substrate-, intermediate-, and product-bound states, representative of major complexes underlying the kinetic constant kcat. Both inhibitors, substrates and catalytically relevant loop motifs increasingly populate catalytically competent conformations as temperature increases. These changes occur even in temperature ranges where kinetic measurements show roughly linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior where parameters characterizing the system are assumed to be temperature independent. Simple analysis shows that linear Arrhenius/Eyring behavior can still be observed when the underlying activation energy / enthalpy values vary with temperature, e.g., due to structural changes, and that the underlying thermodynamic parameters can be far from values derived from Arrhenius/Eyring model fits. Our results indicate a critical role for temperature-dependent atomic-resolution structural data in interpreting temperature-dependent kinetic data from enzymatic systems.

Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

ResultsIn this study, we generated the functional annotation of the genomes of five newly identified species of Gram-positive bacteria, four of which are non-spore-forming and one spore-forming, all isolated from the ISS. Using a deep-learning based tool - deepFRI - we were able to functionally annotate close to 100% of protein-coding genes in all studied species, overcoming other annotation tools. Our comparative genomic analysis highlights common characteristics across all five species and specific genetic traits that appear unique to these ISS microorganisms. Proteome analysis mirrored these genomic patterns, revealing similar traits. The collective annotations suggest adaptations to life in space, including the management of hypoosmotic stress related to microgravity via mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity to counteract heightened radiation exposure, and the presence of mobile genetic elements enhancing metabolism. In addition, our findings suggest the evolution of certain genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenic capabilities, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis and ATP-dependent transporters. These traits, exclusive to the ISS microorganisms, further substantiate previous reports explaining why microbes exposed to space conditions demonstrate enhanced antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.

ConclusionOur findings indicate that the microorganisms isolated from ISS we studied have adapted to life in space. Evidence such as mechanosensitive channel proteins, increased DNA repair activity, as well as metallopeptidases and novel S-layer oxidoreductases suggest a convergent adaptation among these diverse microorganisms, potentially complementing one another within the context of the microbiome. The common genes that facilitate adaptation to the ISS environment may enable bioproduction of essential biomolecules need during future space missions, or serve as potential drug targets, if these microorganisms pose health risks.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

In rod-shaped bacteria, the Rod complex inserts peptidoglycan polymers into the cell wall circumferentially, generating material anisotropy that promotes anisotropic growth. Wall teichoic acids, an abundant, non-load-bearing component of the Gram-positive cell wall, are also essential for rod-shape for unknown reasons. Here, we report a direct role for wall teichoic acids in anisotropic peptidoglycan synthesis. We show that wall teichoic acids provide a cohesive cell wall substrate that is required for Rod complex activity; conversely, removing wall teichoic acids yields a porous cell wall incapable of sustaining Rod complex activity. Consistent with this, cell elongation and Rod complex motion arrest in cells depleted for wall teichoic acids, but resume following hyperosmotic shocks that contract the cell wall. We further show that cells lacking wall teichoic acids rely instead on the bifunctional peptidoglycan synthesis enzyme PBP1, whose isotropic peptidoglycan synthesis is responsible for the subsequent growth and loss of shape. Taken together, these findings reveal that the microstructure of the Gram-positive cell wall is an essential regulatory factor in its own synthesis.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

This study attempts to address this gap by determining the complete nucleotide sequences of several key plasmids.

Notably, mini-plasmids containing these RIP and oriV sequences successfully replicated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Through pangenome analyses using the PLSDB database with the experimentally identified RIP gene reference, 2,351/59,895 plasmids were classified, and their core and accessory genes, including ARGs, were detected. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the RIPs with publicly available protein sequences enabled the grouping of existing PIncs into distinct evolutionary lineages, providing a robust framework for identifying RIPs across a broader range of previously uncharacterised plasmids.

Once activated, they migrate towards injured sites, where they proliferate and differentiate to replenish lost or damaged cells. Although effective tissue repair relies critically on the ability of SCs to reach and populate damaged sites, mechanisms guiding SCs towards these sites are not well understood. This is largely due to the technical challenges involved in monitoring SC dynamics in real time in vivo. Here, we devised an experimental framework that allows for real-time tracking of the spatiotemporal dynamics of intestinal SCs (ISCs) during the early phases of gut regeneration. Our data show that ISC migration is rapidly induced following injury and precedes ISC divisions and differentiation. We identify the Drosophila PDGF-VEGF-related receptor, Pvr, as a critical regulator of the migratory response to epithelial damage. ISC-specific Pvr depletion strongly suppresses ISC migration towards affected sites as well as the regenerative response. We further show that the Pvr ligand, PDGF-VEGF-related factor 1 (Pvf1), is produced by the trachea/vasculature in response to intestinal damage and acts as a guidance signal to direct ISC migration towards affected areas. Our work highlights a critical role of gut-trachea/vasculature crosstalk in guiding ISC migration during regeneration. As neovascularization of injured sites is a key feature of tissue repair in both flies and mammals, these findings could be relevant to regenerative processes in a wide range of adult tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

This workflow is simpler, cheaper, and higher throughput than current DNA assembly approaches that require DNA to be moved in and out of cells at different procedural steps.

This type of data is not a quantifiable resource for any kind of quantitative investigations and any manual review or structured information retrieval is time-consuming and costly. The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) mark a paradigm shift in natural language processing and offer new possibilities for structured Information Extraction (IE) from medical free text. This protocol describes a workflow for LLM based information extraction (LLM-AIx), enabling extraction of predefined entities from unstructured text using privacy preserving LLMs. By converting unstructured clinical text into structured data, LLM-AIx addresses a critical barrier in clinical research and practice, where the efficient extraction of information is essential for improving clinical decision-making, enhancing patient outcomes, and facilitating large-scale data analysis. The protocol consists of four main processing steps: 1) Problem definition and data preparation, 2) data preprocessing, 3) LLM-based IE and 4) output evaluation. LLM-AIx allows integration on local hospital hardware without the need of transferring any patient data to external servers. As example tasks, we applied LLM-AIx for the anonymization of fictitious clinical letters from patients with pulmonary embolism. Additionally, we extracted symptoms and laterality of the pulmonary embolism of these fictitious letters. We demonstrate troubleshooting for potential problems within the pipeline with an IE on a real-world dataset, 100 pathology reports from the Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), for TNM stage extraction. LLM-AIx can be executed without any programming knowledge via an easy-to-use interface and in no more than a few minutes or hours, depending on the LLM model selected.","NA","medrxiv",1725487635634

These multivalent proteins can bind to distant binding sites along the chromatin backbone and bring them together in spatial proximity, leading to collapsed conformations. Recently, it has been suggested that these proteins not only drive collapse of the chromatin polymer, but also reswelling at higher concentrations. In this study, we investigate the physical mechanisms underlying this unexpected reswelling behaviour. We use Langevin dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained homopolymer to investigate the effects of the valencies of both the binders and the monomers on the polymer conformations. We found that while the extent of collapse of the polymer is strongly dependent on the binder valency, the extent of reswell is largely determined by the monomer valency. Furthermore, we also discover two different physical mechanisms that drive reswelling of the polymer -excluded volume effects and loss of long-range loops. Finally, we obtain a phase diagram to determine the regimes where either of these mechanisms are the dominant factor leading to polymer reswelling.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

To understand how long-term MDA impacts schistosome populations, we analysed whole-genome sequence data of 570 Schistosoma mansoni samples (and the closely related outgroup species, S. rodhaini) from eight countries incorporating both publicly-available sequence data and new parasite material. This revealed broad-scale genetic structure across countries but with extensive transmission over hundreds of kilometres. We characterised variation across the transient receptor potential melastatin ion channel, TRPMPZQ, a target of praziquantel, which has recently been found to influence praziquantel susceptibility. Functional profiling of TRPMPZQ variants found in endemic populations identified four mutations that reduced channel sensitivity to praziquantel, indicating standing variation for resistance. Analysis of parasite infrapopulations sampled from individuals pre- and post-treatment identified instances of treatment failure, further indicative of potential praziquantel resistance. As schistosomiasis is targeted for elimination as a public health problem by 2030 in all currently endemic countries, and even interruption of transmission in selected African regions, we provide an in-depth genomic characterisation of endemic populations and an approach to identify emerging praziquantel resistance alleles.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

One such pathogen is the fungus Fusarium graminearum, which causes Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) disease on wheat and barley. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that F. graminearum expresses many candidate effector proteins during early phases of the infection process, some of which are annotated as proteases. However, the contributions of these proteases to virulence remains poorly defined. Here, we characterize a F. graminearum endopeptidase, FgTPP1 (FGSG_11164), that is highly upregulated during wheat spikelet infection and is secreted from fungal cells. To elucidate the potential role of FgTPP1 in F. graminearum virulence, we generated FgTPP1 deletion mutants ({Delta}Fgtpp1) and performed FHB infection assays. While the number of completely bleached spikes infected by F. graminearum wild-type reached 50% of total infected spikes, the number of fully bleached spikes infected by{Delta} Fgtpp1 mutants was 25%, suggesting FgTPP1 contributes to fungal virulence. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged FgTPP1 revealed that FgTPP1 localizes, in part, to chloroplasts and attenuates chitin-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, reactive oxygen species production, and cell death induced by an autoactive disease resistance protein when expressed in planta. Notably, the FgTPP1 protein is conserved across the Ascomycota phylum, making it a core effector among ascomycete plant pathogens. These properties make FgTPP1 an ideal candidate for decoy substrate engineering, with the goal of engineering resistance to FHB, and likely other crop diseases caused by ascomycete fungi.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Here we recorded the paths of desert ants navigating in their natural habitat under various displacement conditions. We demonstrate that ants learn continuously the routes they travel and memorize them in one trial, without the need for reward or punishment, and even if these routes are meandering and do not lead to places of interest: a concept called  latent learning, which is typically associated with the formation of map-like representation in vertebrates. Yet, the failure of ants to solve simple artificial navigation tasks -even with the goal being clearly visible- reveals that they relied on egocentric visual memories without map-like representation of the surrounding space. Our results unveil the rules governing the formation and recall of latent memories. A model shows that it can be implemented in the insects Mushroom bodies brain area through dynamic interactions between short- and long-lasting memories.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

However, the utility of IL2 as a treatment is limited by this same pleiotropy, and protein engineering to bias specificity towards either the regulatory T cell (Treg) or CD8 T cell lineage often requires a trade-off in protein production or total bioactivity. Here we use SolubiS, a computational algorithm-based method, to predict mutations within the IL2 structure to improve protein production yield while altering cellular selectivity, to generate a mutein with elevated therapeutic potential. The design and testing process identified the V126R (murine) / V111R (human) mutation as a Treg-enhancing mutein, creating a cation repulsion to inhibit primary binding to IL2RB, with a post-IL2RA confirmational shift enabling secondary IL2RB binding, and hence allowing the trimeric receptor complex to form. In human IL2, additional N110R T151R aggregation-protecting mutations could improve protein yield of the V111R mutation. The approach also generated novel CD8 T cell-promoting mutations. Y79K created a cation-cation repulsion with IL2RA, while Q50W enhanced CD8 T cell activity through potential pi-stacking enhancing binding to IL2RB, with the combination highly stimulatory for CD8 T cells. For human IL2, Y65K (homolog to murine Y79K) coupled with E82K prevented IL2RA binding, however it required the aggregation-protecting mutations of N110R T151R to rescue production. These muteins, designed with both cellular specificity and protein production features, have potential as both biological tools and therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

We previously reported that KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2)-dependent signaling promotes gemma cup and gemma formation. KAI2A perceives unidentified endogenous ligand(s), tentatively referred to as KAI2 ligands (KL). Perception of KL by KAI2 triggers MAX2-dependent proteolysis of MpSMXL. In this study, we identified genes working downstream of KAI2-dependent signaling in M. polymorpha. We found that KAI2-dependent signaling positively controls the expression of MpLONLEY GUY (MpLOG), encoding a cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme. Disruption of the MpLOG function decreased endogenous cytokinin levels and caused defects similar to KAI2-dependent signaling mutants. Moreover, supplying exogenous cytokinins rescued the defects of Mplog and KAI2-dependent signaling mutants, implying that cytokinins work downstream of KAI2-dependent signaling. Activation of MpLOG by KAI2-dependent signaling occurs in a highly cell-type-specific manner, leading to cell-specific induction of GEMMA CUP-ASSOCIATED MYB1 (GCAM1), the master regulator of vegetative reproduction of M. polymorpha. We propose a genetic cascade, starting from KAI2-dependent signaling, that promotes vegetative reproduction through the induction of MpLOG and GCAM1. The interaction between KAI2-dependent signaling and cytokinin in M. polymorpha provides a novel insight into the function and evolution of KAI2-dependent signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Parallels between PD and the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which controls transport between nucleoplasm and cytoplasm, have been discussed previously. PD transport shares similar features with the phase separation dependent NPC transport. Here, bioinformatics, proteomics and imaging were used to identify proteins with similarities to phase separating nucleoporins (NUP). We identified 21 NUPs in PD fractions, and validated dual localization to NPC and PD for 6 NUPs. The transmembrane anchor NUP CPR5 localized to PD orifices as detected by high-resolution imaging. cpr5 mutants had reduced intercellular transport activity for cargo larger than 54 kDa, but not for smaller cargo around 376 Da. The data indicates a role for NUP CPR5 in macromolecular transport through PD. Together this is consistent with the recruitment of NUPs in the green lineage to form a PD pore gating complex and is in line with the idea of a phase separation as diffusion barrier at PD.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Mesophyll cells of protective layer 1 (P1), just beneath the wound, transition into epidermal cells, which seal the wound by depositing cuticle. As P1 undergoes cell death, protective layer 2 (P2), which underlies P1, takes the place of P1 and undergoes ligno-suberization.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enzyme resistant RNA molecules that accumulate in ageing tissues. Furthermore, circRNAs bind gDNA directly, forming circRNA:DNA complexes which can induce DNA breaks. This study investigated circRNA accumulation with gestational age in healthy and stillbirth placentae and determined whether circRNAs directly interact with placental DNA causing DNA damage. Placenta samples (n=60 term uncomplicated; n=4 unexplained stillbirth, 23, 26, 31, 34 weeks' gestation) were assessed for DNA damage using an alkaline Comet Assay. Expression levels of 6 candidate circRNAs (circ_0009000, circ_0024157, circ_0061017, circ_0036877, circ_0054624 and circ_0111277), and their linear transcripts, were quantified using qPCR. Physical interaction of candidate circRNAs with DNA was confirmed by DNA:RNA ImmunoPrecipitation (DRIP). The effect of circ_0009000 knockdown in HEK293T cells was assessed following transfection with either a siRNA (designed to knockdown circ_0009000) or a scrambled siRNA control, at 5, 10 and 20 nM final concentrations using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. DNA damage was assessed by Comet Assay. Compared with earlier gestations (37, 38, 39 and 40 weeks'), placental DNA damage and expression of all 6 candidate circRNAs, but not their linear transcripts, were increased in 40 and 41+ weeks' gestation samples, and in stillbirth. DRIP-qPCR signal size was significantly larger in term placentae than in enzyme-treated controls, confirming that all candidate circRNA loci bind to placental DNA. Depletion of circ_0009000 by specific siRNA in HEK293T cells, significantly reduced DNA damage compared to control. Stillbirth placentae show accelerated ageing with premature accumulation of candidate circRNAs (first evidence in humans) at levels consistent with older gestation tissue.

Recent studies have shown that the aberrant transition of monomeric aS into solid-like aggregates can occur via an intermediate liquid-like state, where the protein partitions between dense and dilute phases. Although aS is not typically recognized as an RNA-binding protein, it can bind RNA under aggregation conditions. However, the impact of RNA on aS dynamics within dilute and dense phases remains unclear. Here, we employ a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy techniques to explore aS dynamics in both phases in the presence of RNA. Our sensitive analysis of the dilute phase revealed the formation of precursor nanoclusters involved in initiating phase separation. We also uncovered heterogeneity within the dense phase, discovering that aS molecules exist in two distinct mobility states: freely diffusing molecules or confined within micro-domains. Additionally, RNA was found to induce morphological changes in the dense phase. Our quantitative analysis, based on fluorescence lifetime measurements, showed that RNA alters the liquid-like properties of the aS dense phase, promoting a liquid-to-solid transition. These findings indicate the active role of RNA in modulating the material properties of aS and influencing its phase transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

An inferred ARG can be used to construct a genetic relatedness matrix, which can be leveraged within a linear mixed model for the analysis of complex traits. However, these analyses are computationally infeasible for large datasets. We introduce a computationally efficient approach, called ARG-RHE, to estimate narrow-sense heritability and perform region-based association testing using an ARG. ARG-RHE relies on scalable randomized algorithms to estimate variance components and assess their statistical significance, and can be applied to multiple quantitative traits in parallel. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the computational efficiency, statistical power, and robustness of this approach. We then apply it to detect associations between 21,374 genes and 52 blood-related traits, using an ARG inferred from genotype data of 337,464 individuals from the UK Biobank. In these analyses, combining ARG-based and imputation-based testing yields 8% more gene-trait associations than using imputation alone, suggesting that inferred genome-wide genealogies may effectively complement genotype imputation in the analysis of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Replisome (dis)assembly is tightly coordinated with cell cycle progression to ensure genome stability. However, factors that prevent premature CMG unloading and replisome disassembly are poorly described. Since disassembly is catalyzed by ubiquitination, deubiquitinases (DUBs) represent attractive candidates for safeguarding against untimely and deleterious CMG unloading. We combined a targeted loss-of-function screen with quantitative, single-cell analysis to identify human USP37 as a key DUB preventing replisome disassembly. We demonstrate that USP37 maintains active replisomes on S-phase chromatin and promotes normal cell cycle progression. Proteomics and enzyme assays revealed USP37 interacts with the CMG complex to deubiquitinate MCM7, thus antagonizing replisome disassembly. Significantly, USP37 protects normal epithelial cells from oncoprotein-induced replication stress. Our findings reveal USP37 to be critical to the maintenance of replisomes in S-phase and suggest USP37-targeting as a potential strategy for treating malignancies with defective DNA replication control.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Similar to motor skill learning in mammals, vocal learning in songbirds requires a set of interconnected brain areas that make up an analogous basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit known as the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP). Although neural activity in the AFP has been extensively investigated during awake singing, very little is known about its neural activity patterns during offline sleep periods. In this work, we used chronically implanted Neuropixels probes to investigate neural activity in the AFP during offline periods of natural sleep. We found that neurons in the pallial region LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium) transitioned from sparse synchronous firing to asynchronous firing during sleep, which corresponded to slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, respectively. SWS periods were associated with increased spiking variability for LMAN neurons, but not for neurons in the striatal region Area X (proper name). Coinciding with the increased spiking variability, we observed that populations of LMAN neurons were co-activated at specific time points during sleep in bursting events that were characterized by a negative deflection in the local field potential (LFP) and a transient increase in gamma power. Overall, the LMAN population bursting events were highly reminiscent of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity observed in rodent hippocampus. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe strong cross-area field coherence between LMAN and Area X, although individual LMAN-Area X LFP pairs did show coherence > 0.5. These results provide the first description of cross-area dynamics within the AFP during sleep. Furthermore, the observation of SWR-like events during sleep in LMAN suggests that large-scale population events have diverse functions across vertebrates.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

While altered ER-associated processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, whether shifts in ER morphology underlie these functional changes is unclear. We report that ER remodeling is a conserved feature of the aging process in models ranging from yeast to C. elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as an exemplar of metazoan aging, we find that as animals age, ER mass declines in virtually all tissues and ER morphology shifts from rough sheets to tubular ER. The accompanying large-scale shifts in proteomic composition correspond to the ER turning from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism. To drive this substantial remodeling, ER-phagy is activated early in adulthood, promoting turnover of rough ER in response to rises in luminal protein-folding burden and reduced global protein synthesis. Surprisingly, ER remodeling is a pro-active and protective response during aging, as ER-phagy impairment limits lifespan in yeast and diverse lifespan-extending paradigms promote profound remodeling of ER morphology even in young animals. Altogether our results reveal ER-phagy and ER morphological dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal aging and enhanced longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Here, we assess the contribution of variation in viral load and daily contact rates to this heterogeneity by combining viral load and contact survey data in a mathematical model to estimate the secondary infection distribution. Using data from the BBC Pandemic and CoMix contact surveys, we estimate the basic reproduction number (R0 = 2.2, 95% CI 2.1-2.2) from first principles and the secondary infection distribution throughout the pandemic in the UK in 2020, and the effectiveness of frequent and pre-event rapid testing for reducing superspreading events. We find that individual heterogeneity in contacts - rather than individual heterogeneity in shedding - drives observed heterogeneity in the secondary infection distribution. Our results suggest that regular testing every 3 days, or pre-event testing with a minimum event size of 10, could reduce the mean reproduction number below 1 with moderate to high levels of uptake (60-80%) for pre-pandemic contact levels. This work demonstrates the potential for using viral load and contact data to predict heterogeneity in transmission and the effectiveness of rapid testing strategies for curbing transmission in future pandemics.","NA","medrxiv",1725487635634

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts.

Common variant analysis highlighted three longevity-associated loci: APOE, ZSCAN23, and MUC5B. We identified six genes whose burden of loss-of-function variants is significantly associated with reduced lifespan: TET2, ATM, BRCA2, CKMT1B, BRCA1 and ASXL1. Additionally, in eight genes, the burden of pathogenic missense variants was associated with reduced lifespan: DNMT3A, SF3B1, CHL1, TET2, PTEN, SOX21, TP53 and SRSF2. Most of these genes have previously been linked to oncogenic-related pathways and some are linked to and are known to harbor somatic variants that predispose to clonal hematopoiesis. A direction-agnostic (SKAT-O) approach additionally identified significant associations with C1orf52, TERT, IDH2, and RLIM, highlighting a link between telomerase function and longevity as well as identifying additional oncogenic genes.

The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha).

We have recently shown that T follicular helper (TFH) cells are precursors of TR1 cells and that the TFH-to-TR1 cell transdifferentiation process is characterized by the progressive loss and acquisition of opposing transcription factor gene expression programs that evolve through at least one transitional cell stage. Here, we use a broad range of bulk and single-cell transcriptional and epigenetic tools to investigate the epigenetic underpinnings of this process. At the single cell level, the TFH-to-TR1 cell transition is accompanied by both, downregulation of TFH cell-specific gene expression due to loss of chromatin accessibility, and upregulation of TR1 cell-specific genes linked to chromatin regions that remain accessible throughout the transdifferentiation process, with minimal generation of new open chromatin regions. By interrogating the epigenetic status of accessible TR1 genes on purified TFH and conventional T cells, we find that most of these genes, including Il10, are already poised for expression at the TFH cell stage. Whereas these genes are closed and hypermethylated in Tconv cells, they are accessible, hypomethylated and enriched for H3K27ac-marked and hypomethylated active enhancers in TFH cells. These enhancers are enriched for binding sites for the TFH and TR1-associated transcription factors TOX-2, IRF4 and c-MAF. Together, these data suggest that the TR1 gene expression program is genetically imprinted at the TFH cell stage.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Subsequently, vaccination of mice using the equine H3N8 Kentucky/1/91 strain of equine H3N8 vaccine induced similar broadly reactive and neutralizing serum antibodies to human seasonal strains and to high pathogenicity avian influenza strains. Challenge of mice vaccinated with equine H3N8 or recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) based on the same strain protected vaccinees from high-dose lethal virus challenges. Protection was associated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies to the HA head, esterase, and stem regions that was similar to that of antibodies generated in horses after vaccination.

Las is transmitted by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) where it colonizes the phloem tissue, resulting in substantial economic losses to citrus industry worldwide. Despite extensive efforts, effective management strategies against HLB remain elusive, necessitating a deeper understanding of the pathogen s biology. Las undergoes cell-to-cell movement through phloem flow and colonizes different tissues in which Las may have varying interactions with the host. Here, we investigate the transcriptomic landscape of Las in citrus seed coat vasculatures, enabling a complete gene expression profiling of Las genome and revealing unique transcriptomic patterns compared to previous studies using midrib tissues. Comparative transcriptomics between seed coat, midrib and ACP identified specific responses and metabolic states of Las in different host tissue. Two Las virulence factors that exhibit higher expression in seed coat can suppress callose deposition. Therefore, they may contribute to unclogging sieve plate pores during Las colonization in seed coat vasculature. Furthermore, analysis of regulatory elements uncovers a potential role of LuxR-type transcription factors in regulating Liberibacter effector gene expression during plant colonization. Together, this work provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of the devastating citrus HLB.

This is due to the ""in cell"" nature of the natural process, the 2- state behavior of maturation (no detectable intermediates) in some viruses in vitro 3 and heterogeneous populations of particle intermediates that are only partially matured in other systems 4. The non-enveloped, T=4, ssRNA-containing, Nudaurelia capensis omega virus (N{omega}V), is a highly accessible model system that exemplifies the maturation process of a eukaryotic virus. During maturation the particle shrinks in outer diameter from 482 [A] (pH 7.5) to 428 [A] (pH 5.0). It is possible to mimic the maturation process in vitro by lowering the pH of a population of procapsids produced in heterologous systems5. Indeed, by controlling the pH in vitro it is possible to produce homogenous populations of intermediate N{omega}V virus-like particles (VLPs) that occur too fleetingly to be observed in vivo 6.

Here we report structural models, based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), of five intermediates in the N{omega}V maturation process. The structures of the intermediate particles reveal unique, quaternary position-dependent trajectories and refolding of subunit N and C-terminal regions, including the formation of the autocatalytic cleavage site at N570. The detailed structures reported here, coupled with previously determined structures of the procapsids and mature particles, allows the maturation pathway to be described in detail for the first time for a eukaryotic virus.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Until now, the mechanism of sex determination in cephlaopods has been a mystery. Using a chromosome-level genome assembly generated with long read sequencing, we report the first evidence for genetic sex determination in cephalopods. We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

To understand how neurons work together and develop to mediate number sense, we used two-photon fluorescence light sheet microscopy to capture the activity of individual neurons throughout the brain of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), while displaying a visual number stimulus to the animal. We identified number-selective neurons as early as 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) and found a proportional increase of neurons tuned to larger (>2) quantities after 3 dpf. To determine if these neurons are sufficient to encode the correct quantity, we used machine learning to predict the stimulus from the neuronal activity and observed that the prediction accuracy improves with age. Given ethanols propensity to inhibit cognitive functions, we tested its effect on number sense and found a decrease of active number-selective neurons in the forebrain during ethanol exposure, suggesting cognitive impairment. The findings here are a significant step towards understanding neural circuits devoted to discrete magnitudes and our methodology to track single neuron activity across the whole brain is broadly applicable to other fields in neuroscience.

Decades of work that have provided insights into pathophysiological manifestations of sucrose overfeeding have employed paradigms that rarely mimic human consumption of SSBs. Thus, our understanding of multi-organ cross-talk and molecular and/or cellular mechanisms, which operate across scales and drive physiological derangement is still poor. By employing a paradigm of sucrose water feeding in mice that closely resembles chronic SSB consumption in humans (10% sucrose in water), we have unraveled hitherto unknown tissue-specific mechanistic underpinnings, which contribute towards perturbed physiology. Our findings illustrate that systemic impaired glucose homeostasis, mediated by hepatic gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance, does not involve altered gene expression programs in the liver. We have discovered the pivotal role of the small intestine, which in conjunction with liver and muscles, drives dyshomeostasis. Importantly, we have uncovered rewiring of molecular mechanisms in the proximal intestine that is either causal or consequential to systemic ill-effects of chronic sucrose water consumption including dysfunction of liver and muscle mitochondria. Tissue-specific molecular signatures, which we have unveiled, clearly indicate that inefficient utilization of glucose is exacerbated by enhanced uptake by the gut. Besides providing systems-wide mechanistic insights, we propose that consumption of SSBs causes intestinal  molecular addiction for deregulated absorption of hexose-sugars, and drives diseases such as diabetes and obesity.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Despite their critical role, the processes by which NLR genes diversify remain poorly characterised due to the extraordinary sequence, structural, and regulatory variability of NLRs, even among closely related individuals. To understand the evolution of NLR diversity in Arabidopsis thaliana, we leverage graph-based methods to define pangenomic NLR neighbourhoods in 17 genetically diverse genomes. We integrate full-length transcript and transposable element information to exhaustively annotate all intact and degraded NLRs, enabling exploration of the processes that underpin the birth, death and maintenance of NLR diversity within a species. Our main finding is that many uncorrelated mutational processes create NLR diversity, and that there is no single metric that captures on its own the true extent of NLR structural and sequence variation. This immense diversity in plant immune system diversification allows populations to survive the constant onslaught of pathogens, not unlike vertebrate adaptive immunity, where variation is also generated by a variety of complementary mechanisms, albeit at the level of individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

ObjectiveThe objective was to evaluate the immunogenicity/alloimmunization potential of Helaina rhLF (effera) from K. phaffii over a 28-day period compared to bovine LF (bLF). It was hypothesized that rhLF would have an equal or lower immunogenic potential compared to bLF, which is permitted for use in conventional foods and infant formula in the EU and US.

MethodsStudy 1 was a randomized, double-blind, parallel arm, controlled trial where 66 healthy adults were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: high-dose rhLF (3.4 g/d), low-dose rhLF (0.34 g/d), or bLF (3.4 g/d) (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06012669). Participants completed a 28-day (Day 28) supplementation period followed by a 28-day washout period (Day 56) and an additional 28-day follow-up period (Day 84). Study 2 was a 12-week observational study with no intervention that enrolled 24 healthy adults. In both studies, fasting blood was obtained on Days 0, 28, 56, and 84 for analysis of anti-bLF and anti-hLF antibody levels as the primary endpoint as well as other secondary safety endpoints including complete blood count, iron biomarkers, and metabolic panel.

ResultsIn Study 1, the change from baseline to Day 56 in serum anti-bLF antibodies in the bLF group (least squares geometric mean and 95% confidence interval for the post/pre ratio: 3.01; 2.08, 4.35) was greater than the changes in serum anti-hLF antibodies in the low-dose rhLF (1.07; 0.77, 1.49; P<0.001) and high-dose rhLF (1.02; 0.62, 1.70; P<0.001) groups. In Study 2, the post/pre ratio at Day 56 in serum anti-hLF and anti-bLF antibodies were 1.00 (0.93, 1.08) and 1.01 (0.94, 1.09), respectively, confirming no change in anti-hLF antibodies in Study 1 or Study 2. Changes in all safety outcomes in Study 1 were similar between groups and within normal ranges.

ConclusionThese results support the safety and tolerability of efferaTM as a food ingredient at an intake level up to 3.4 g/d in healthy adults.","NA","medrxiv",1725487635634

Addressing this gap, we generated extensive RNA-sequencing data for multiple organs across 22 representative species over the fern phylogeny, assembling high-quality transcriptomes. These data facilitated the construction of a time-calibrated fern phylogeny covering all major clades, revealing numerous whole-genome duplications and highlighting the uniqueness of fern genetics, with half of the uncovered gene families being fern-specific. Our investigation into fern cell walls through biochemical and immunological analyses identified occurrences of the lignin syringyl unit and its independent evolution in ferns. Moreover, the discovery of an unusual sugar in fern cell walls hints at a divergent evolutionary path in cell wall biochemistry, potentially driven by gene duplication and sub-functionalization. We provide an online database preloaded with genomic and transcriptomic data for ferns and other land plants, which we used to identify an independent evolution of lignocellulosic gene modules in ferns. Our data provide a framework for the unique evolutionary path that ferns have navigated since they split from the last common ancestor of euphyllophytes more than 360 million years ago.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Differences in copy number and other sources of extrinsic noise generate variance in transgene expression and limit the performance of synthetic gene circuits. In a therapeutic context, supraphysiological expression of transgenes can compromise engineered phenotypes and lead to toxicity. To ensure a narrow range of transgene expression, we design and characterize Compact microRNA-Mediated Attenuator of Noise and Dosage (ComMAND), a single-transcript, microRNA-based incoherent feedforward loop. We experimentally tune the ComMAND output profile, and we model the system to explore additional tuning strategies. By comparing ComMAND to two-gene implementations, we highlight the precise control afforded by the single-transcript architecture, particularly at relatively low copy numbers. We show that ComMAND tightly regulates transgene expression from lentiviruses and precisely controls expression in primary human T cells, primary rat neurons, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and human induced pluripotent stem cells. Finally, ComMAND effectively sets levels of the clinically relevant transgenes FMRP1 and FXN within a narrow window. Together, ComMAND is a compact tool well-suited to precisely specify expression of therapeutic cargoes.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

We asked whether BTSP could also be a plasticity mechanism for generation of non-spatial responses in the hippocampus and what roles the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) play in driving non-spatial BTSP. By performing simultaneous calcium imaging of dorsal CA1 neurons and chemogenetic inhibition of LEC or MEC while mice performed an olfactory working memory task, we discovered BTSP-like events which formed stable odor-specific fields. Critically, the success rate of calcium events generating a significant odor-field increased with event amplitude, and large events exhibited asymmetrical formation with the newly formed odor-fields preceding the timepoint of their induction event. We found that MEC and LEC play distinct roles in modulating BTSP: MEC inhibition reduced the frequency of large calcium events, while LEC inhibition reduced the success rate of odor-field generation. Using two-photon calcium imaging of LEC and MEC temporammonic axons projecting to CA1, we found that LEC projections to CA1 were strongly odor selective even early in task learning, while MEC projection odor-selectivity increased with task learning but remained weaker than LEC. Finally, we found that LEC and MEC inhibition both slowed representational drift of odor representations in CA1 across 48 hours. Altogether, odor-specific information from LEC and strong odor-timed activity from MEC are crucial for driving BTSP in CA1, which is a synaptic plasticity mechanism for generation of both spatial and non-spatial responses in the hippocampus that may play a role in explaining representational drift and one-shot learning of non-spatial information.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1725487635634

Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness. Our findings suggest that targeting AABs could benefit some LC patients.","NA","medrxiv",1725487635634

From this family, we estimate an average of 192 DNMs per generation, including 75.5 de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), 7.4 non-tandem repeat indels, 79.6 de novo indels or structural variants (SVs) originating from tandem repeats, 7.7 centromeric de novo SVs and SNVs, and 12.4 de novo Y chromosome events per generation. STRs and VNTRs are the most mutable with 32 loci exhibiting recurrent mutation through the generations. We accurately assemble 288 centromeres and six Y chromosomes across the generations, documenting de novo SVs, and demonstrate that the DNM rate varies by an order of magnitude depending on repeat content, length, and sequence identity. We show a strong paternal bias (75-81%) for all forms of germline DNM, yet we estimate that 17% of de novo SNVs are postzygotic in origin with no paternal bias. We place all this variation in the context of a high-resolution recombination map ([~]3.5 kbp breakpoint resolution). We observe a strong maternal recombination bias (1.36 maternal:paternal ratio) with a consistent reduction in the number of crossovers with increasing paternal (r=0.85) and maternal (r=0.65) age. However, we observe no correlation between meiotic crossover locations and de novo SVs, arguing against non-allelic homologous recombination as a predominant mechanism. The use of multiple orthogonal technologies, near-telomere-to-telomere phased genome assemblies, and a multi-generation family to assess transmission has created the most comprehensive, publicly available ""truth set"" of all classes of genomic variants. The resource can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to understand the most fundamental processes underlying human genetic variation.","NA","biorxiv",1725487635634

Discontinuation and reinitiation patterns for patients with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D) are not well-understood.

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

All analyses were conducted for patients with and without T2D.

ResultsAmong 96,544 adults initiating GLP-1 RA, the mean (SD) age was 55.1 (13.3) years, 65.2% were female, 73.7% were white, and 61.3% had T2D. Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1725487635634
