In this work, we have characterized the transport and accumulation of different tattoo inks in the lymphatic system using a murine model. Upon quick lymphatic drainage, we observed that macrophages mainly capture the ink in the lymph node (LN). An initial inflammatory reaction at local and systemic levels follows ink capture. Notably, the inflammatory process is maintained over time as we observed clear signs of inflammation in the draining LN two months following tattooing. In addition, the capture of ink by macrophages was associated with the induction of apoptosis in both human and murine models. Furthermore, the ink accumulated in the LN altered the immune response against a COVID-19 vaccine. We observed a reduced antibody response following vaccination with a mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, which was associated with a decreased expression of the Spike protein in macrophages in the draining LN. Considering the unstoppable trend of tattooing in the population, our results are crucial in informing the toxicology programs, policymakers, and the general public regarding the potential risk of the tattooing practice associated with an altered immune response.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292453

In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies from immunised cattle, primarily because of their ability to produce antibodies with ultra-long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) domains. Such antibodies have been shown to have potent and cross-reactive neutralisation phenotypes in other virus infections. Following extended immunisation with different forms of spike protein and using single B-cell sorting and phage display techniques, we isolated 33 mAbs, including 10 with ultra-long CDRH3s (>50 amino acids). Of these, mAbs P7 and 99 exhibited remarkable neutralisation breadth and potency. Notably, mAb P7, which possessed an ultra-long CDRH3, neutralised all tested variants, including SARS-CoV-1, with IC50 values ranging from 0.01 ug/mL to 1.06 ug/mL. This antibody was also cross-reactive against a panel of RBDs from diverse sarbecovirus species. Structural studies revealed that mAb 99 targets a region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that overlaps with the ACE2 binding site. Although the structure of the P7 Fab-RBD complex was not resolvable, data suggest P7 induces trimer dissociation by binding to an occluded RBD epitope, likely mediated by the extended CDRH3 structure. Syrian hamster challenge experiments, using several VOCs, showed that mAbs P7 and 99 significantly reduced lung viral load. These findings highlight the potential of bovine-derived, especially those possessing ultra-long CDRH3s, as effective therapeutics against current and future sarbecovirus threats.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292453

In plants, centromeres are loaded with CENH3-variant nucleosomes, which direct kinetochore formation and spindle microtubule interaction. Plant centromeres are frequently composed of megabase-scale satellite repeat arrays, or retrotransposon nests. In monocentric genomes, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, extended regions of pericentromeric heterochromatin surround the CENH3-occupied satellite arrays. A zone of suppressed meiotic crossover recombination contains the centromere and extends into the pericentromeres. Here, we explore how Arabidopsis natural genetic variation influences centromere-proximal crossover frequency, and segregation distortion through meiosis, when homologous centromeres are structurally heterozygous. Results: We used fluorescent crossover reporters to survey the effect of natural variation on centromere-proximal recombination in twelve F1 hybrids, capturing Arabidopsis Eurasian and relict diversity. The majority of F1 hybrids showed either elevated or suppressed centromere-proximal crossovers (49 of 60), relative to inbreds. We relate hybrid crossover frequencies to patterns of centromeric structural variation, and in a subset of accessions, to epigenetic patterns of CENH3 loading and DNA methylation. The fluorescent reporters also allow segregation distortion through meiosis to be compared between inbred and hybrid strains. We observed a minority of hybrids (18 of 60) with distorted segregation through meiosis compared to inbreds, with and without simultaneous change to centromere-proximal crossover frequency. Conclusions: We reveal a complex relationship between centromere structural variation, epigenetic state, crossover recombination, and segregation distortion. We propose a model for how Arabidopsis centromere structural heterozygosity may cause segregation distortion during female meiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Previous studies have demonstrated that one dose of psilocybin leads to persisting neural and behavioral changes. The durability of psilocybin's effects suggests that there are likely alterations of gene expression at the transcriptional level. In this study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the dorsal medial frontal cortex of male and female mice. Samples were collected at 1, 2, 4, 24, or 72 hours after psilocybin or ketamine administration and from control animals. At baseline, major excitatory and GABAergic cell types selectively express particular serotonin receptor transcripts. The psilocybin-evoked differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons were involved in synaptic plasticity, which were distinct from genes enriched in GABAergic neurons that contribute to mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. The effect of psilocybin on gene expression was time-dependent, including an early phase at 1-2 hours followed by a late phase at 72 hours of transcriptional response after administration. Ketamine administration produced transcriptional changes that show a high degree of correlation to those induced by psilocybin. Collectively, the results reveal that psilocybin produces time-dependent and cell-type specific changes in gene expression in the medial frontal cortex, which may underpin the drug's long-term effects on neural circuits and behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

This suggests that different brain areas serve distinct functions supporting complex behavior. However, a common observation is that essentially anything that an animal senses, knows, or does can be decoded from neural activity in any brain area (4-6). If everything is everywhere, why have distinct areas? Here we show that the function of a brain area is more related to how different types of information are combined (formatted) in neural representations than merely whether that information is present. We compared two brain areas: the middle temporal area (MT), which is important for visual motion perception (7, 8), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which is linked to decision-making and reward expectation (9,10)). When monkeys based decisions on a combination of motion and reward information, both types of information were present in both areas. However, they were formatted differently: in MT, they were encoded separably, while in dlPFC, they were represented jointly in ways that reflected the monkeys' decision-making. A recurrent neural network (RNN) model that mirrored the information formatting in MT and dlPFC predicted that manipulating activity in these areas would differently affect decision-making. Consistent with model predictions, electrically stimulating MT biased choices midway between the visual motion stimulus and the preferred direction of the stimulated units (11), while stimulating dlPFC produced 'winner-take-all' decisions that sometimes reflected the visual motion stimulus and sometimes reflected the preference of the stimulated units, but never in between. These results are consistent with the tantalizing possibility that a modular structure enables complex behavior by flexibly reformatting information to accomplish behavioral goals.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

How LE8 can foster healthy brain aging and interact with genetic risk factors to render the aging brain less vulnerable to dementia is not well understood.

ObjectiveTo investigate the impact of LE8 on the white matter brain aging and the moderating effects of the APOE4 allele.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cross-sectional study uses genetic, imaging, and other health-related data collected in the UK Biobank cohort. Participants included non-pregnant whites with LE8 variables, diffusion tensor imaging data, and genetic data on APOE4 available, and excluded the extreme white matter hyperintensities. The baseline assessment was performed from 2006 to 2010. The diffusion tensor imaging data were collected since 2014.

ExposuresLE8 variables, encompassing diet, physical activity, smoking, sleep, body mass index, lipids, hemoglobin, and blood pressure.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe white matter brain age was predicted from regional fractional anisotropy measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging data using the random forest regression method. The outcome white matter brain age gap was calculated by subtracting individuals chronological age from their predicted brain age.

ResultsThe analysis included 9,430 women and 9,387 men (mean age 55.45 [SD: 7.46] years). Higher LE8 scores were associated with lower white matter brain age gap, indicating delayed brain aging. The findings are consistent for each of the individual LE8 variables. The effect was stronger among non-APOE4 carriers (124 days younger per 10-point increase, 95% CI, 102 to 146 days; P<0.001) than APOE4 carriers (84 days younger per 10-point increase, 95% CI, 47 to 120 days; P<0.001). Notably, early middle-aged women with APOE4 showed significant interactions between LE8 scores and brain aging (P interaction = 0.048), not observed in men.

Conclusions and RelevanceAdherence to LE8 is associated with delayed brain aging, moderated by genetic factors such as APOE4. These findings highlight the potential of behavioral and lifestyle interventions in reducing dementia risk, emphasizing tailored prevention plans for those with different genetic predispositions to dementia and sex.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

Here, we address this question using a multi-omic approach that integrates super-resolution imaging and metabolic analyses to profile macrophages from a mouse model of mitochondrial disease arising from a heteroplasmic mutation (m.5019A>G) in the mitochondrial tRNA for alanine. These m.5019A>G macrophages exhibit defects in respiratory chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) due to decreased intra-mitochondrial translation. To adapt to this metabolic stress, mitochondrial fusion, reductive glutamine metabolism, and aerobic glycolysis are all increased. Upon inflammatory activation, type I interferon (IFN-I) release is enhanced, while the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxylipins are restrained in m.5019A>G macrophages. Finally, an in vivo endotoxemia model using m.5019A>G mice reveal elevated IFN-I levels and sickness behaviour. In conclusion, our study identifies an unexpected imbalance in innate immune signalling in response to a pathogenic mtDNA mutation, with important implications for the progression of pathology in patients with mtDNA diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Here, we investigate the neural signatures associated with passive auditory spatial attention in children with ASD (n = 21, ages 6-17) relative to age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children (n = 31), using source-localized magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effect modeling showed decreased cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed increased alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between auditory cortex seeds and frontoparietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with worse behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores and increased ASD symptomatology. Our results align with the hypothesis that auditory spatial attention generally, and specifically orientation to sounds even when experienced passively, differs in ASD individuals.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

While mu opioid receptors are central to the analgesic effects of opioid drugs, the endogenous opioid neurocircuitry underlying pain and placebo analgesia remains poorly understood. The ventrolateral column of the posterior periaqueductal gray is a critical hub for nociception and endogenous analgesia mediated by opioid signaling. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the cell-type identities, the sub-second neural dynamics involved in pain modulation, the role of endogenous peptide neuromodulators, and the contextual factors influencing these processes. Using spatial mapping with single-nuclei RNA sequencing of pain-active neurons projecting to distinct long-range brain targets, alongside cell type-specific and activity-dependent genetic tools for in vivo optical recordings and modulation of neural activity and opioid peptide release, we identified a functional dichotomy in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Neurons expressing mu opioid receptors encode active nociceptive states, whereas enkephalin-releasing neurons drive pain relief during recovery from injury, in response to learned fear predictions, and during placebo analgesia. Finally, by leveraging the functional effects of placebo analgesia, we used direct optogenetic activation of vlPAG enkephalin neurons to drive opioid peptide release, resulting in a robust reduction in pain. These findings show that diverse need states converge on a shared midbrain circuit that releases endogenous opioids with high spatiotemporal precision to suppress nociceptive activity and promote analgesia.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

While we have substantial knowledge of the molecular parts and rules of cytoskeletal assembly, we know less about how structures are remodeled, for example to interconvert centrioles from the ciliary base to the centrosome. To study this in an evolutionary context we use the chytrid fungus, Rhizoclosmatium globosum, a member of the zoosporic fungi which have centrioles and cilia, lost in other fungal lineages. Chytrids undergo reorganization of their microtubule cytoskeleton as they cycle from zoospore to multinucleated coenocyte. We use comparative bioinformatics, RNA sequencing, and expansion microscopy to map the microtubule cytoskeleton over the chytrid lifecycle. We find that when zoospores encyst, cilia are retracted into the cytoplasm and degraded, and centrioles detach but are protected from degradation. A shortened proximal centriole then forms the mitotic centrosome and ultimately elongates to form cilia at the end of the mitotic cycles, driven by a conserved transcriptional program. Thus, structural remodeling of the chytrid centriole is coupled temporally to ciliated stages rather than mitotic cycles, which may serve as a mechanism to tune microtubule organization to meet the needs of different lifecycle stages.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Characterising key epidemiological parameters for H5N1 is critical should this become widespread.

AimTo identify and estimate critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 from past and current outbreaks, and to compare their characteristics with human influenza subtypes.

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for systematic reviews reporting parameter estimates from primary data or meta-analyses. To address gaps, we searched Google Scholar for studies of any design providing relevant estimates. We estimated the basic reproduction number for the outbreak in the US and estimated the serial interval using data from previous household clusters in Indonesia. We also applied a branching process model to simulate transmission chain size and duration to assess if simulated transmission patterns align with observed dynamics.

ResultsFrom 32 studies, we identified H5N1s epidemiological profile as having lower transmissibility (R0 < 0.2) but higher severity compared to human subtypes. Evidence suggests H5N1 has longer incubation ([~]4 days vs [~]2 days) and serial intervals ([~]6 days vs [~]3 days) than human subtypes, impacting transmission dynamics. Key gaps remain regarding latent and infectious periods.

ConclusionsWe characterised critical epidemiological parameters for H5N1 infection. The current U.S. outbreak shows lower pathogenicity but similar transmissibility compared to prior outbreaks. Longer incubation and serial intervals may enhance contact tracing feasibility. These estimates offer a baseline for monitoring changes in H5N1 epidemiology.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

However, the processes underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Examining the dynamics of signal and noise correlations among neuron pairs in chronic calcium imaging experiments in the mouse auditory cortex, we investigate how activity-dependent, Hebbian-like plasticity, and activity-independent, stochastic synaptic processes contribute to representational drift. We found that signal correlations predict future noise correlations, suggesting that stimulus-induced co-activation leads to increased effective connectivity between neuron pairs. Moreover, simple linear network models were able to account for the observed temporal dependencies between signal and noise correlations, but only if both Hebbian-like plasticity and stochastic changes of either inputs or recurrent synapses contribute to representational drift. In conclusion, our findings suggest that continuous sensory input-driven Hebbian-like plasticity can balance ongoing stochastic synaptic changes, thereby preventing the network's functional degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

However, few biocontainment strategies can support the longer-term microbial survival that may be desired in a target environment without repeated human intervention. Here, we introduce the concept of an orthogonal obligate commensalism for the autonomous creation of environments that are permissive for survival of a biocontained microbe. We engineer one microbe to produce a non-standard amino acid (nsAA), and we engineer synthetic auxotrophy in a second microbe via reliance on this nsAA for growth. We show that this obligate commensalism is highly effective, with the survival of our commensal organism during co-culture dependent on the presence of our producer strain. We also show that this commensalism is orthogonal to a small microbial consortium isolated from maize roots, with survival of the synthetic auxotroph conditional upon the presence of the nsAA-producing strain in the consortium. Overall, our study demonstrates a transition from a chemical to a biological dependence for biocontained organisms that could lay the groundwork for biocontained synthetic ecologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

In contrast to somatic tissues, mutations driving clonal expansions in spermatogonia (CES) are also transmitted to the next generation. This results in an effective increase of de novo mutation rate for CES drivers. CES was originally discovered through extreme recurrence of de novo mutations causing Apert syndrome. Here, we develop a systematic approach to discover CES drivers as hotspots of human de novo mutation. Our analysis of 54,715 trios ascertained for rare conditions, 6,065 control trios and population variation from 807,162 mostly healthy individuals identifies genes manifesting rates of de novo mutations inconsistent with plausible models of disease ascertainment. We propose 15 genes hypermutable at loss-of-function (LoF) sites as candidate CES drivers. Additional 17 genes feature hypermutable missense mutations at individual positions, suggesting CES acting through gain-of-function (GoF). Among candidates are 5 of 13 known CES drivers, 11 cancer drivers, and 16 members of major signaling pathways; notably, 12 genes show CES evidence in direct sperm sequencing. CES increases the average mutation rate ~16-fold for LoF genes in both control trios and sperm and ~500-fold for pooled GoF sites in sperm. Positive selection in the male germline elevates the prevalence of genetic disorders and increases polymorphism levels, masking the effect of negative selection in human populations. Despite the excess of mutations in disease cohorts for 15 LoF CES driver candidates, only 5 show clear evidence of disease causality, suggesting that CES may lead to false-positive disease associations","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

However, the impact of having a COVID-19 diagnosis on this trend is not known. Methods Using longitudinal data from January 2019 to June 2023 collected by the US National Institute for Health's National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), children (age 2-18 years) with positive COVID-19 test results (n=11,474, 53% male, mean [SD] age 5.57 [+/-3.29] years, 54% white, mean [SD] 5.2 [+/-2.9] BMI observations per participants) were matched with COVID-19 negative children with identical demographic characteristics and similar observation window. We compared BMI percentile trajectories between the COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative cohorts, with further evaluation performed on COVID-19 positive patients stratified by hospitalization status. Results COVID-19 positive patients had a greater increase in %BMI_p95 than COVID-19 negative patients (average increase of 2.34 (+/-7.73) compared to 1.46 (+/-6.09), p<0.0005). COVID-19 positive patients gained more weight after their diagnosis of COVID-19 than before. Non-hospitalized children gained more weight than hospitalized children (average increase in %BMI_p95 of 2.38 (+/-7.65)) compared to 1.87 (+/-8.54)). Mixed effect regression analyses demonstrated that these associations remained even after adjusting for time, demographics, and baseline %BMIp95. Conclusions Having a COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with more rapid weight gain, especially after diagnosis and early in the pandemic.

Of the associated RNA-guided Cas effector nucleases, Cas12a2 stands out as the only known example exhibiting RNA-triggered collateral cleavage of three distinct substrates: single-stranded (ss)RNA, ssDNA, and double-stranded (ds)DNA. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of collateral cleavage, including which of these activities dominates during the Cas12a2-mediated immune response. Here, we show that Cas12a2 cleaves collateral DNA substrates over RNA substrates, even when RNA substrates are more abundant. This preference relies on a positive cooperativity mechanism that requires the four aromatic clamp residues that stabilize unwound and distorted dsDNA in the RuvC nuclease active site. Leveraging the cleavage preference for collateral DNA, we demonstrate that RNA-activated Cas12a2 can cleave a ssDNA probe in the presence of high concentrations of non-target RNA, while the RNA-targeting Cas13a cannot. This work thus reveals how Cas12a2 decides amongst different collateral cleavage substrates, with immediate implications for understanding Cas12a2-based immunity, improving molecular diagnostics, and laying a mechanistic foundation for future Cas12a2-based technologies.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

For successful integration of pest management, especially for early diagnostics of new aggressive or fungicide-resistant lineages, it is critical to understand population diversity in the field. We look at whole-genome sequence data for three datasets to differentiate within field diversity in fields of similar size: one dataset from a newly sampled field population from the United Kingdom and two publicly available datasets from fields from the United States and Switzerland. Inspection of population structure and diversity features, such as minor allele frequency distribution and clonality, show no within-field structure, the most abundant SNPs are present in low frequency, and European fields have higher clonality. Knowing that effectors play particularly important roles in (a)virulence, we specifically assess effector diversity characteristics. Whereas on a whole-genome scale, we can see separation of the populations at the regional scale, we do not find such separation for the effectors.

However, their intricate crosstalk and contributions to pathogenesis remain elusive, highlighting the need for innovative in vitro approaches for investigating glial interactions in neuroinflammation. The aim of this study was to develop advanced human-based glial coculture models to explore the inflammatory roles and interactions of microglia and astrocytes in vitro. Methods: We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia and astrocytes cultured both in conventional culture dishes and in a compartmentalized microfluidic chip coculture platform. This novel platform features separate compartments for both cell types, enabling the creation of fluidically isolated microenvironments with spontaneous migration of microglia toward astrocytes through interconnecting microtunnels. To induce inflammatory activation, glial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a combination of tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}), or interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) for 24 hours. The glial activation and crosstalk were analyzed with immunocytochemistry, the secretion of inflammatory factors from the culture media was measured, and microglial migration was quantified. Results: Microglia-astrocyte cocultures were successfully generated in both conventional cultures and the microfluidic chip platform. Inflammatory stimulation with LPS and TNF-/IL-1{beta} elicited cell type-specific responses in microglia and astrocytes, respectively. Notably, the levels of secreted inflammatory mediators were altered under coculture conditions, revealing significant glial crosstalk. Utilization of our microfluidic coculture platform facilitated the study of microglial migration and glial activation within distinct inflammatory microenvironments. Microglia migrated efficiently toward the astrocyte compartment, and the chemoattractant adenosine diphosphate (ADP) notably increased microglial migration within this platform. Furthermore, inflammatory stimulation of the microfluidic chip cocultures successfully recapitulated glial crosstalk, revealing unique responses. This crosstalk was associated with elevated levels of complement component C3 in the cocultures, emphasizing the intricate interplay between microglia and astrocytes under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions: Our results depict an elaborate molecular crosstalk between inflammatory microglia and astrocytes, providing evidence of how glial cells orchestrate responses during neuroinflammation. Importantly, we demonstrate that the microfluidic coculture platform developed in this study for microglia and astrocytes provides a more functional and enhanced setup for investigating inflammatory glial interactions in vitro.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Understanding the individual and collective mechanical contributions of these three different cytoskeletal elements is essential to elucidate how cells maintain mechanical integrity during deformation. Here we use a custom single-cell rheometer to identify the distinct contributions of actin and vimentin to the viscoelastic and nonlinear elastic response of cells to uniaxial compression. We used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild type (WT) and vimentin knockout (vim -/-) mice in combination with chemical treatments to manipulate actin polymerization and contractility. We show through small amplitude oscillatory measurements and strain ramp tests that vimentin, often overlooked in cellular mechanics, plays a role comparable to actin in maintaining cell stiffness and resisting large compressive forces. However, actin appears to be more important than vimentin in determining cellular energy dissipation. Finally we show by comparing wild type and enucleated cells that compression stiffening originates from the actin and vimentin cytoskeleton, while the nucleus appears to play little role in this. Our findings provide insight into how cytoskeletal networks collectively determine the mechanical properties of cells, providing a basis to understand the role of the cytoskeleton in the ability of cells to resist external as well as internal forces.

Here, we demonstrate that abscisic acid (ABA)-catabolizing ABA 8'-hydroxylase, encoded by CYP707A3 , plays a critical role in this resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Elevated humidity induces CYP707A3 expression, which is essential for reducing ABA levels and promoting stomatal opening, thereby limiting bacterial water-soaking and infection following leaf invasion. High humidity also increases cytosolic Ca2+ levels via the Ca2+ channels CNGC2 and CNGC4, with partial involvement from CNGC9, activating the calmodulin-binding transcription activator CAMTA3 to drive CYP707A3 induction.

Furthermore, it has not been established whether mitochondria in germ plasm possess unique characteristics essential for their function. In this study, we demonstrate that mitochondria are indispensable for PGCs development in non-teleost fishes and that their role is not dependent on their origin from germ plasm. Using sturgeon embryos, we showed that UV radiation applied to the vegetal pole effectively eliminates germ plasm, including mitochondria, and prevents PGCs formation. Remarkably, we restored germ plasm function and PGCs development by injecting mitochondria derived from donor eggs, even when these mitochondria were not originally part of the germ plasm. Transplanted mitochondria were successfully identified in larval PGCs using a fluorescent PKH26 tracer, and in interspecies transplantation experiments, their presence was confirmed using species-specific mtDNA and mtRNA primers in larvae and individual PGCs. Our findings reveal that mitochondria are critical but not germ plasm-specific determinants of PGCs formation.

However, it is not clear why non-canonical IAV RNAs activate RIG-I in a sequence- and RNA structure-dependent manner. Insight into this process is critical for understanding the exact molecular steps through which an influenza virus infection activates innate immune signaling and why differences exist in infection outcome. Here we investigated whether non-canonical or aberrant transcription of mini viral RNAs (mvRNA), a <125 nt long RNA whose expression is increased in pandemic and highly pathogenic IAV infections, contributes to RIG-I activation. We find that mvRNAs can cause non-canonical transcription termination through a truncated 5' polyadenylation signal or a 5' transient RNA structure that interrupts polyadenylation. The resulting capped complementary RNAs (ccRNA) can trigger the release of a template mvRNA and activate RIG-I when they form a heteroduplex with a negative sense RNA. Overall, our findings indicate that sequential rounds of non-canonical or aberrant viral replication and transcription explain the sequence-dependent efficiency with which mvRNAs trigger innate immune signaling.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Targeting joint inflammation with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) has not resulted in the anticipated reduction in pain for many patients. This can partly be explained by the concept of central sensitisation whereby spinal and supraspinal pathways have a lower threshold of activation leading to increased perception of pain. Synovial stromal cells such as fibroblasts are also thought to play a role through peripheral sensitisation of nerves in the joint. Synovial fibroblasts are known to produce pro-algesic mediators such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and nerve growth factor (NGF) at the mRNA level. These pro-algesic mediators could activate sensory nerve fibres that send signals from the joint to the spinal cord, thereby driving persistent pain in RA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate which pro-algesic mediators are produced by lining versus sublining fibroblasts and whether the level of these mediators correlates with clinical measures of pain in patients with RA. Methods and analysis FiND-Pain RA is a multi-centre observational study which will recruit 50 patients with seropositive RA who attend the rheumatology department of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital, London and the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford. Clinical examination, pain-focused patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), ultrasound examination and ultrasound guided synovial biopsy of the knee will be performed. The levels of known and putative pro-algesic mediators will be measured in fibroblasts from the lining and sublining layer of the synovium. The location and spatial morphology of sensory nerve fibres and their proximity to lining and sub-lining fibroblasts will be characterized. The primary outcome will be to determine whether the knee pain scores of participants correlate with the level of LIF, a novel putative pain-mediator expressed in sub-lining fibroblasts. The secondary outcomes will be to determine whether other pro-algesic mediators produced by lining or sub-lining fibroblasts correlate with clinical measures of pain and to assess the location and proximity of sensory nerve fibres to lining versus sub-lining fibroblasts.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

These PTPs bind overlapping sets of ITIM/ITSM-bearing proteins, suggesting that they might have some redundant functions. By studying T cell-specific single and double knockout mice, we found that SHP1 and SHP2 redundantly restrain naive T cell differentiation to effector and central memory phenotypes, with SHP1 playing the dominant role. Surprisingly, loss of SHP2 alone in T cells enhanced the antitumor effects of anti-PD-1 antibodies, whereas there was no effect of SHP1 deletion. Also unexpectedly, the absence of both PTPs resulted in poorer tumor control and failure to respond to PD-1 blockade, associated with reduced frequency and activation of T cells and dendritic cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that CD4+, but not CD8+ T cells lacking SHP1 and SHP2 show increased activation-induced cell death upon anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation. Adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells restored normal levels of tumor control in mice lacking both PTPs. Together, our results demonstrate that SHP1 or SHP2 is required to prevent activation-induced cell death of CD4+ T cells and is critical for tumor immunity, raising the possibility that inhibition of SHP2 might augment the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1-based immune therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

The interactions between algae and bacteria at the phycosphere interface are known to include mutualism, commensalism, competition or antagonism. Here, based on in situ observation and on an in vitro interaction study, we report on a novel form of starvation-induced hunting that the cells of selected Vibrio species exert on the dinoflagellate species. Results showed that Vibrio atlanticus was able to coordinate lightning group attacks then kill the dinoflagellate Alexandrium pacificum ACT03. Briefly, the observed coordinated mechanism of algal-killing consists of first, the immobilization stage involving the secretion of algicidal metabolites that disrupt the flagella of the prey. The attack stage resembles the wolf-pack attack strategy, during which Vibrios surrounds algal cells at high density for a brief period without invading them. Finally, the killing stage induces the lysis and degradation of the dinoflagellates. By using a combination of biochemical, proteomic, genetic and fluorescence microscopy approaches, we showed that this relationship is not related to the decomposition of algal organic matter, Vibrio quorum sensing pathways, to the toxicity of the algae or to the pathogenicity of the bacterium but is conditioned by nutrient stress, iron availability and link to the iron-vibrioferrin transport system of V. atlanticus. This is the first evidence of a new mechanism that could be involved in regulating Alexandrium spp. blooms and giving Vibrio a competitive advantage in obtaining nutrients from the environment.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

However, whether this entrainment extends to subcortical structures and shapes human behavior remains unclear. In a first experiment, we used intracranial EEG recordings in epileptic patients during a visual search task. While neutral stimulation induced moderate entrainment, we demonstrated that 5 Hz negative-valence stimulation can significantly entrain theta oscillations in a widespread task-related cortico-subcortical network, with increased synchrony in the ventral visual stream, the hippocampus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In a second behavioral experiment in healthy individuals, visual search performance improved under both stimulation conditions, but memory for target images, assessed through an additional recognition task, was significantly enhanced after negative stimulation. These findings unravel the role of valence in modulating subcortical brain activity and behaviors through rhythmic sensory stimulation and pave the way for its further application in clinical intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Here, we systematically investigate how foraging in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is influenced by its bacterial diet, E. coli. By screening C. elegans behavior on 3983 E. coli knockout strains, we identified 22 E. coli metabolic mutants that are aversive to C. elegans in a long-term foraging assay. These include the global metabolic regulator CRP and genes affecting cysteine synthesis, vitamin B6 synthesis, and iron uptake. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter associated with feeding in many animals, allows C. elegans to distinguish wild-type E. coli from these mediocre diets through bidirectional signaling. Serotonin produced by the ADF serotonergic neurons supports attraction to wild-type E. coli with the serotonin receptor genes ser-4 and ser-5, whereas serotonin produced by the NSM serotonergic neurons differentially drives aversion to two mediocre diets through four serotonin receptor genes, ser-1, ser-7, mod-1, and lgc-50. Serotonin receptors act in multiple target neurons, including octopamine-producing neurons that suppress aversion across all diets. In addition, dopamine promotes aversion, in part by inhibiting octopaminergic neurons. These results reveal interactions between neuromodulatory circuits in the context-dependent evaluation of dietary quality.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

In mice and humans, we found that growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (the most prominent respiratory pathogen in a retrospective cohort of patients with ARDS) is enhanced by increased alveolar concentrations of multiple ALI/ARDS-associated metabolites, which are derived from the blood and cross the compromised alveolar-capillary barrier during alveolar leak. Collectively, this work reveals an ecological mechanism by which pathogens may survive in the injured lung microenvironment and identifies new potential targets for secondary pneumonia prevention and treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) has inherently low catalytic efficiency, making it a key target for photosynthesis and crop improvement. However, introducing mutations to the chloroplast-encoded Rubisco large subunit (rbcL), which contains the enzyme's catalytic sites, is technically challenging. In this study, we successfully generated a range of chloroplast-genome-edited Arabidopsis thaliana plants targeting rbcL by a targeted base editor, ptpTALECD. The M309I and D397N substitutions in rbcL resulted in an increased Rubisco catalytic rate (kcat) without any reductions of Rubisco content, thereby enhancing photosynthetic rates and plant growth under both current atmospheric CO2 concentrations (i.e., 381 mol mol-1) and projected future concentrations (i.e., 549 mol mol-1). Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural analysis showed that the M309I and D397N substitutions, although located far from the catalytic site, induce structural alterations in the catalytic (60s) loops.

Network-based mechanisms underlying stimulation-induced fluency declines are not fully understood. Objective: This study investigates how STN-DBS stimulation locations interact with brain connectivity patterns, and whether this differentially drives VF changes. Methods: 20 patients with Parkinson's disease and unilateral STN-DBS were analyzed. Electrodes were localized with estimates for volume of tissue activation (VTA). VTAs were seeded in normative functional and structural connectomes to identify connectivity profiles correlating with VF changes (R-maps). Additionally, amongst the fibers passing through VTAs, a two-sample t-test assigned fibers associated with VF improvement or decline. Results: VF declines occurred following unilateral left but not right STN-DBS. R-maps revealed that improvements correlated with greater connectivity to prefrontal structures in right hemisphere such as inferior and superior frontal gyrus, whereas declines localized to structures on the left. Fibers filtered from right VTAs were associated with VF improvements. Fibers from left VTAs were associated with declines, but the gradient of fiber t-scores were distributed across an anterior-posterior axis ranging from supplementary motor area to paracentral lobule. Conclusion: Unilateral STN-DBS interacts with distributed cognitive networks that display strong hemispheric lateralization. Beyond the effects of implant hemisphere, our findings suggest that connectivity between local STN subregions to larger whole-brain networks impacts VF performance, in a manner that could yield more tailored approaches to electrode targeting and clinical programming.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

Various sample concentrating methods, such as centrifugal ultrafiltration, have been utilized in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 detection studies. However, freeze drying, a promising technique commonly used for concentrating and preserving various biological samples, has yet to be explored in this field. This study compared the performance of freeze-drying and the widely used centrifugal ultrafiltration method in terms of recovery rate, detection limit, and other key parameters for concentrating 72 wastewater samples collected from four facilities in El Paso, TX. Statistical analyses revealed that the freeze-drying method demonstrated higher overall recovery efficiency (20.33% vs 13.00%), a superior detection ratio (68.4% vs. 31.6%), and lower detection limits (0.06copies/mL vs 0.35copis/mL) than centrifugal ultrafiltration, particularly during the early stages of the pandemic. Despite its longer processing time than centrifugal ultrafiltration, freeze-drying offers several notable advantages, including eliminating pretreatment steps, providing flexible sample storage options, preventing signal loss and sample degradation, and reducing labor and exposure risks. Freeze-drying also does not require intensive training for concentrating sewage water. These benefits, combined with its efficient capture of viral RNA, position freeze-drying as a promising alternative for wastewater virus detection, especially in resource-constrained lab settings at local wastewater treatment plants. The protocol and findings reported here provide a baseline for further development of freeze-drying-based methods for enabling community-level early warning and surveillance against emerging viral threats in the future.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

Transcriptome profiling in hnRNPD knockout cells identified significant upregulation of PTEN and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. HnRNPD mediates the destabilization of PTEN mRNA by binding to the class II AU-Rich Element (ARE) in 3'UTR of PTEN. The expression of hnRNPD and PTEN are strongly negatively correlated in OSCC tissue specimens, further corroborating hnRNPD-mediated PTEN destabilization. The hnRNPD knockout inhibited autophagy, evident by an accumulation of autophagic vesicles and decreased autophagic flux. Mechanistically, the hnRNPD knockout reduced the expression of NF-{kappa}B, eventually downregulating its transcriptional target LC3b, a key mediator of autophagy.

However, the strategies employed by soybean to tolerate such conditions remain poorly understood. This study elucidates the interactions of physiological adjustments, host factors, and microbial associations in soybean using multi-omics approaches in Clark (tolerant) and Arisoy (sensitive) genotypes exposed to Fe deficiency and drought. Clark demonstrated stress resilience by maintaining osmotic balance, nutritional status, and photosynthetic efficiency, whereas these were severely affected in Arisoy. Furthermore, Fe retention in Clark, accompanied by the upregulation of ferritin-like proteins, may mitigate oxidative stress by reducing Fenton reactions. Interestingly, the elevated jasmonic acid and salicylic acid in the roots of Clark, compared to the lower levels in Arisoy, may contribute to differential physiological adjustments for stress adaptations. RNA-seq analysis revealed 818 and 500 upregulated, along with 931 and 361 downregulated genes, in roots of Clark and Arisoy, respectively, under stress. We observed the upregulation of symbiotic genes, such as Chalcone-flavonone isomerase 1 and SWEET10, accompanied by increased rhizosphere siderophore and root flavonoid in Clark. This indicates a significant microbial role in driving differential stress tolerance. Amplicon sequencing revealed distinct root and nodule microbiome dynamics, with Clark recruiting beneficial microbes such as Variovorax and Paecilomyces, known for promoting plant growth, whereas Arisoy displayed an opposite pattern. In addition, Clark maintained Bradyrhizobium and tissue nitrogen status, supported by ammonium retention and induction of Ammonium transporter 1 in the roots. Furthermore, in vitro compatibility between V. paradoxus and P. lilacinus suggests a synergistic interaction, with their localized signals benefiting Clark. Remarkably, enriched microbiomes significantly improved growth parameters, accompanied by elevated rhizosphere siderophore in sensitive genotypes under stress. This study is the first to uncover mechanisms of dual stress tolerance in soybean that may advance breeding and biofertilizer strategies for climate resilience.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

In maize and sorghum, the evolution of C4-NADP-malic enzyme (C4-NADP-ME) involved gene duplication and neofunctionalization, leading to the emergence of two plastidic isoforms: C4-NADP-ME and nonC4-NADP-ME, each with distinct kinetic and structural features. While C4-NADP-ME functions primarily as a tetramer, nonC4-NADP-ME exists in an equilibrium between dimeric and tetrameric forms, favoring the dimer in solution. This study shows which evolutionary changes in amino acid sequences influence the structure and function of these isoforms. By integrating X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, computational molecular modeling and targeted biochemical analysis of mutant and truncated protein variants, we identify crucial roles for the N- and C-terminal regions and specific amino acid residues in governing isoform oligomerization. Our results reveal that the N-terminal region is essential for stabilizing the dimeric form of nonC4-NADP-ME, whereas specific adaptive substitutions and interactions with the C-terminal region enhance the stability of the tetrameric state characteristic of the C4-adapted isoform. We propose that differences in the N-terminal domain between the C4 and nonC4 isoforms reflect distinct selective pressures, which have driven their evolutionary divergence to fulfill specialized cellular functions.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

We investigated 30 L. monocytogenes collected from artisan cheese production facilities in Vermont from 2006-2008 for sanitizer tolerance, biofilm formation capacity, biofilm architecture, and tolerance to sanitizers of mature biofilms. Sixteen of these isolates represented a putatively persistent ribotype (DUP-1042B) found in one facility over two years. Isolates of the putatively persistent ribotype all aligned into ST191 and were 0-6 SNPs different, confirming they represented a persistent strain. We found no significant differences in sanitizer tolerance or crystal assay-based attachment capacity between persistent and non-persistent strains. However, using scanning electron microscopy, we found that isolates FML-10 and FML-19 formed substantially denser biofilms after 10 days on stainless steel. Ten-day old biofilms were highly resistant to sanitizers; neither quaternary ammonium nor sodium hypochlorite-based sanitizers achieved an EPA-recommended 6-log reduction. More EPS was found in low-nutrient biofilm conditions; thus, non-food contact surfaces in cheese environments may induce formation of biofilms with high sanitizer tolerance. Our results highlight the importance of regular environmental testing and strain typing for rapid detection of L. monocytogenes colonization attempts while they can still be removed without major renovations or equipment replacement.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Much work remains, however, in clarifying how the nutritional status of each patient can affect the metabolic vulnerability of drugs and inform individual medication guidelines. Working toward the goal of oncometabolic precision medicine, we introduce CM-SLP (cancer metabolism-based synthetic lethality platform), a high-throughput screening platform that explores the metabolic vulnerability of non-oncology drugs induced by altered nutrient availability and predicts the potential synthetic lethal interactions with either hyper- or hypo-nutrient conditions. We present promising CM-SLP candidates, such as propafenone and biguanides, as representative non-oncology drugs that cooperatively enhance cytotoxicity via dysregulated metabolic pathways. Furthermore, identifying mTOR and Hippo pathways as mediators of combined propafenone/hypoglycemia or biguanides/hypoglycemia treatments, respectively, we were able to circumvent the need for dietary interventions by administering the mTOR or TEAD inhibitors to induce energy stress and cancer cell death. Together, CM-SLP represents a critical step toward integrating metabolic profiling into precision oncology, offering novel therapeutic avenues tailored to individual patient needs.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most serious types of DNA damage, as they lead to loss of genetic information and death when not repaired. In E. coli, they are recognised and processed by the RecBCD complex, which initiates repair by homologous recombination. Although the repair dynamics downstream of RecBCD has been well characterised, it is still unclear how long this complex stays attached to DNA and what triggers its dissociation in vivo. To answer these questions, we imaged RecB at the single-molecule level, and quantified its dynamic behaviour in bacterial cells exposed to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that induces DSBs. Our results show that RecB forms long-lived complexes with DSBs (10 seconds), and that its dissociation from DNA is an intrinsic property of the complex, that does not depend on the amount of DNA damage, nor the following steps in the repair pathway. Moreover, we show that we can use RecB binding to DSBs as a marker to estimate the rate of damage formation. This study provides a detailed quantitative insight into the interaction of RecBCD with DNA double-strand ends in E. coli in vivo, and into the bacterial response to DSBs induced by ciprofloxacin.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

This has led to speculation on the potential long-term effects of the vaccines on mortality risk.

MethodsThe study was designed as a retrospective cohort study, and included all individuals aged [&ge;]18 years living in Norway during January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023. Individuals were categorized as either unvaccinated (received no doses), partially vaccinated (received one or two doses) or fully vaccinated (received three or more doses) from the date of vaccination and onwards. Age-stratified Poisson models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios of death (all causes) between vaccination groups, adjusting for sex, calendar time, county of residence and risk group status (nursing home resident or preexisting condition with increased risk of severe COVID-19).

ResultsThe study included 4 645 910 individuals (49.8% women) with 132 963 deaths during follow-up. There was a higher proportion of individuals that were part of a risk group among fully vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals in all age groups, and a lower unadjusted rate of death: 51.5 vs 73.6 per 100 000 person years (py) among individuals aged 18-44 years, 295.1 vs 405.3 per 100 000 py among 45-64 years, and 3620.2 vs 4783.8 per 100 000 py among 65 years or older. The adjusted IRR of death for the same age groups were 0.42 (95% CI 0.38-0.47), 0.39 (95% CI 0.37-0.41) and 0.42 (95% CI 0.41-0.43), respectively. The differences in rate of death between vaccination groups were larger among men and peaked during 2022.

ConclusionVaccinated individuals had a lower rate of all-cause death during 2021-2023 in Norway.

Key messagesIn Norway, as in many Western countries, there has been an excess mortality during 2021-2023, surpassing the numerical count of COVID-19-associated deaths. The excess mortality coincides temporally with the COVID-19 mass vaccination campaigns, but longitudinal data regarding mortality post-vaccination remain sparse. Using real-time national health registry data, we estimate the risk of all-cause mortality by vaccination status in the total adult population in Norway during 2021-2023 and demonstrate a lower rate of all-cause death among vaccinated individuals.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454

Despite changes in settlement patterns, burial practices, and material culture, we document a high degree of genetic continuity. While one set of individuals we analyzed from a large community cemetery was genetically diverse, another site was more homogenous and closed, with numerous consanguineous relationships and evidence of patrilineality and patrilocality.

An open question is how experience interacts with innate constraints to enable functional specialization. We investigate this question by comparing vOTC function across sighted and congenitally blind adults. In sighted adults, a region in lateral vOTC called the fusiform face area (FFA) responds preferentially to faces, whereas distinct left-lateralized portions of vOTC respond to written language. In blind people, lateral vOTC responds to face touching, braille and speech, but their functional co-localization has not been tested. The same group of congenitally blind adults (n=20) touched faces and spatial layouts (Experiment 1) and performed a reading (braille) and spoken language task (Experiment 2). Sighted adults performed analogous tasks in the visual modality (n=28). Using within subject analyses, we replicate the separation of faces and written language in sighted adults: written language responses are found only in left vOTC and within that hemisphere they are separate from faces. By contrast, left and right vOTC responds to language in people born blind and in the left hemisphere face and language responses overlap. These findings suggest that visual experience contributes to segregating responses to face and language in vOTC. Co-localization of face and language responses suggests an innate predisposition for communication-relevant processing in lateral vOTC.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Modification of pre-existing ligands with fragments that can alter the protein surface can lead to the creation of novel compounds (targeted glues) able to induce neo-interactions between the target and an E3 ligase, resulting in targeted protein degradation. By screening a library of potential BRD9 targeted glue compounds, we have discovered a potent and selective, reversibly covalent BRD9 degrader, AMPTX-1. Co-immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments demonstrated that cell treatment with AMPTX-1 induces selective recruitment of BRD9 to the E3 ligase DCAF16. Degradation is dependent on the engagement of the surface Cys58 of DCAF16 and formation of a covalent adduct to DCAF16 is facilitated by the ternary complex formation with BRD9. BRD9 degradation is achieved in vivo after oral dosing, demonstrating that covalent recruitment of DCAF16 is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation and can be achieved with drug-like, orally bioavailable compounds with promising in vivo activity.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

Here, we demonstrate that lactate is essential for nucleotide biosynthesis in pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). The oncogenic histone H3K27M mutation upregulates phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and drives lactate production from [U-13C]-glucose in DMGs. Lactate activates the nucleoside diphosphate kinase NME1 via lactylation and promotes the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates essential for tumor proliferation. Importantly, we show that this mechanistic link between glycolysis and nucleotide biosynthesis provides a unique opportunity for deuterium metabolic imaging of DMGs. Spatially mapping 2H-lactate production from [6,6-2H]-glucose allows visualization of the metabolically active tumor lesion and provides an early readout of response to standard-of-care radiation and targeted therapy that precedes extended survival and reflects pharmacodynamic alterations at the tissue level in preclinical DMG models in vivo at clinical field strength (3T). In essence, we have identified an H3K27M-lactate-NME1 axis that promotes DMG proliferation and facilitates non-invasive metabolic imaging of DMGs.","NA","biorxiv",1736201292454

While some workers unions opposed these mandates, they were supported by most health establishments, policymakers, and academics. Ensuing labour shortages compounded the ongoing health crisis in the province, leading to mounting calls to lift mandates and allow non-compliant, terminated or suspended, workers to return and ease pressures on the system. Nevertheless, mandates remained effective until July 2024, over one year after the World Health Organization had ended its declared Covid-19 global health emergency. Most research has focused on the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not on their lived experience of the policy or their views on its impact on access to, and quality of, patient care.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in British Columbia.

MethodsBetween May and July of 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in British Columbia. We recruited participants through a snowball sampling approach, including professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

ResultsClose to half of respondents, with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination and felt unfree to make their own vaccination choices, yet did not request exemptions due to high rejection rates by employers. Most of them also reported experiencing anxiety or depression, with about one fourth considering suicide, as a result of mandates. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, within the minority of vaccinated respondents, most reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with over half within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of all respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Nearly half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in British Columbia, mandated vaccination in the healthcare sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the labour force, on the sustainability of the health system, on patient care, and on ethical healthcare practice. Findings resemble those of a similar study in the province of Ontario, with perhaps the most salient difference being that in British Columbia the policy was implemented at the provincial, rather than the healthcare establishment, level, leaving no room for individual establishments to opt out.

ConclusionsMeasured against the 2021 criteria proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to evaluate the merits or lack thereof of public policy, the policy of mandated vaccination in British Columbia failed on several fronts - scientific, pragmatic, and ethical. Future research should examine why this and similar policies persist despite the evidence against them. Findings from this and similar studies should be considered, especially during emergencies, to guarantee the quality of the evidence informing policy, health systems sustainability, and the human rights to bodily autonomy and informed consent of both healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1736201292454
