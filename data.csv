Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another. This is a challenging task as such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have generally focused on creating near-ideal structures. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems which use an induced-fit power stroke to generate a structurally frustrated and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and kinetic binding measurements demonstrate that incorporating excited states enables design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 6000-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing cytokine mimics which can be dissociated within seconds from their receptors.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to reactivation of latent viruses such as Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), yet, the extent and impact of viral reactivation in COVID-19 and its effect on the host immune system remain incompletely understood. Here we present a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of viral reactivation of all known chronically infecting viruses in 1,154 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, from the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) study, who were followed prospectively for twelve months. We reveal significant reactivation of Herpesviridae, Enteroviridae, and Anelloviridae families during acute stage of COVID-19 (0-40 days post-hospitalization), each exhibiting distinct temporal dynamics. We also show that viral reactivation correlated with COVID-19 severity, demographic characteristics, and clinical outcomes, including mortality. Integration of cytokine profiling, cellular immunophenotyping, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics demonstrated virus-specific host responses, including elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, CXCL10, and TNF), increased activated CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and upregulation of cellular replication genes, independent of COVID-19 severity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Notably, persistent Anelloviridae reactivation during convalescence ([&ge;]3 months post-hospitalization) was associated with Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) symptoms, particularly physical function and fatigue. Our findings highlight a remarkable prevalence and potential impact of chronic viral reactivation on host responses and clinical outcomes during acute COVID-19 and long term PASC sequelae. Our data provide novel immune, transcriptomic, and metabolomic biomarkers of viral reactivation that may inform novel approaches to prognosticate, prevent, or treat acute COVID-19 and PASC.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b exhibits tropism for the mammary gland, with milk from infected cows containing high levels of viral RNA and infectious virus. The virus's ability to infect the mammary gland suggests potential risks of transmission to offspring through breastfeeding. Here, we show that mammary gland infection with bovine H5N1 influenza in lactating ferrets transmits virus and disease to suckling kits. Viral RNA titers significantly increased in milk over time and remained high in mammary gland tissue. Suckling kits had significantly increased viral RNA in the oral and nasal cavity, as well as in feces. However, viral detection in the dam nasal cavities was delayed, with only minimal virus present in the oral cavity. Lung viral RNA levels were low in dams but high in a sampled suckling kit. Additionally, we detected the expression of the H5N1 receptor, 2,3 sialic acid, in mammary tissue from both ferrets and humans. These data demonstrate that H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infection in lactating dams leads to mastitis-related disease and transmits to suckling pups, resulting in 100% mortality among the neonates.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids are valuable models for studying human organ function, they often lack critical tissue-resident immune cells. Here, we introduce an advanced human heart assembloid model, termed hHMA (human heart-macrophage assembloid), which fully integrates autologous cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (MPs) with pre-existing human heart organoids (hHOs). Through multi-omic analyses, we confirmed that these MPs are phenotypically similar to embryonic cardiac tissue-resident MPs and remain viable in the assembloids over time. The inclusion of MPs significantly impacts hHMA development, influencing cardiac cellular composition, boosting cellular communication, remodeling the extracellular matrix, promoting ventricular morphogenesis, and enhancing sarcomeric maturation. Our findings indicate that MPs contribute to homeostasis via efferocytosis, integrate into the cardiomyocyte electrical system, and support catabolic metabolism. To demonstrate the versatility of this model, we developed a platform to study cardiac arrhythmias by chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory factors linked to arrhythmogenesis in clinical settings, successfully replicating key features of inflammasome-mediated atrial fibrillation. Overall, this work introduces a robust platform for examining the role of immune cells in cardiac development, disease mechanisms, and drug discovery, bridging the gap between in vitro models and human physiology. These findings offer insights into cardiogenesis and inflammation-driven heart disease, positioning the hHMA system as an invaluable tool for future cardiovascular research and therapeutic development.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Here, we introduce iModMix, a novel approach that uses a graphical lasso to construct network modules for integration and analysis of multi-omics data. iModMix uses a horizontal integration strategy, allowing metabolomics data to be analyzed alongside proteomics or transcriptomics to explore complex molecular associations within biological systems. Importantly, it can incorporate both annotated and unidentified metabolites, addressing a key limitation of existing methodologies. iModMix is available as a user-friendly R Shiny application that requires no programming experience (https://imodmix.moffitt.org), and it includes example data from several publicly available multi-omic studies for exploration.

To address this, we present a comprehensive assessment of tissue changes occurring during human aging, utilizing a vast array of whole slide histopathological images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx). We analyzed 25,712 images from 40 distinct tissue types across 983 individuals, applying deep learning to quantify the nuanced morphological changes that tissues undergo with age. We developed 'tissue clocks' - predictors of biological age based on tissue images - which achieved a mean prediction error of 4.9 years and were associated with telomere attrition, the incidence of subclinical pathologies, and comorbidities. In a systematic assessment of biological age rates across organs, we identified pervasive non-uniform rates of aging across the human lifespan, with some organs exhibiting earlier changes (20-40 years old) and others showing bimodal patterns of age-related changes. We also uncovered several associations between demographic, lifestyle, and medical history factors and tissue-specific acceleration or deceleration of biological age, highlighting potential modifiable risk factors that influenced the aging process at the tissue level. Finally, by combining paired histological images and gene expression data, we developed a strategy to predict tissue-specific age gaps from blood samples. This approach was validated in external cohorts of both healthy individuals and those with chronic diseases, revealing the organs most differentially affected by aging in disease contexts. This work offers a new perspective on the aging process by positioning tissue structure as an integrator of cellular and molecular changes that reflect the physiological state of organs. These findings underscore the value of histopathological imaging as a tool for understanding human aging and provide a foundation for the exploration of tissue-specific aging processes in age-associated diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Acute inhibition of ATR with ATR inhibitor (ATRi) triggers a surge in origin firing, leading to increased levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that rapidly deplete all available RPA. This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, triggering a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and PARP1 hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, creating abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we demonstrate that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 trapping and hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Finally, we show that APOBEC3B-induced toxic PARP1 trapping in response to ATRi drives cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating to a context of synthetic lethality when combined with PARP inhibitors. Together, these findings reveal the mechanisms that cause replication forks to break during replication catastrophe and explain why ATRi-treated cells are particularly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Inside mitochondria, SAM-dependent methylations occur at several steps of gene expression, but their role and significance remain unclear. Using direct long-read RNA sequencing on mouse tissue and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial ribosomal gene cluster is not efficiently processed without mitochondrial SAM. This results in the accumulation of unprocessed ribosomal RNA precursors. Protein profiling of ribosome fractions revealed that these precursors are associated with processing and ribosome assembly factors, indicating stalling at an early stage. Structural analysis of the mitochondrial ribosome by cryogenic electron microscopy revealed that mitochondrial SAM is required during peptidyl transferase centre formation and mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Our data thus identify a critical role for methylation at two steps during mitochondrial gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine.

However, detection currently requires costly whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or labor-intensive cytogenetic or FISH imaging, limiting its application in routine clinical diagnosis. To overcome this, we developed ecPath (ecDNA from histopathology), a computational method for predicting ecDNA status from routinely available hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images. ecPath implements a deep-learning method we call transcriptomics-guided learning, which utilizes both transcriptomics and H&E images during the training phase to enable successful ecDNA prediction from H&E images alone, a task not achievable with models trained on H&E images only. It is trained on more than 6,000 tumor whole-slide images from the TCGA cohort with the best performance in predicting ecDNA status in brain and stomach tumors (average AUC=0.78). ecPath revealed that ecDNA-positive tumors are enriched with pleomorphic, larger and high-density nuclei. Testing in an independent cohort, ecPath predicted ecDNA status of 985 pediatric brain tumor patients with an AUC of 0.72. Finally, we applied ecPath to identify ecDNA-positive tumors in the TCGA cohort for which no WGS data were available. Like WGS-based ecDNA-positive labels, the predicted ecDNA-positive status also identify poor prognoses for low grade glioma patients. These results demonstrate that ecPath enables the detection of ecDNA from routinely available H&E imaging alone and help nominate aggressive tumors with ecDNA to study and target it.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Lack of variation in stress perfusion between patients with and without cardiovascular risk factors suggests that CMD may be a consequence of severe COVID-19, warranting further investigation to elucidate mechanisms, and guide potential therapeutic interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1731967765214

SOX2 is one of the key pluripotency transcription factors, expressed during embryonic development and active in adult stem cells. In cancer, SOX2 is frequently dysregulated and associated with tumor stemness and poor patient survival. SOX2 expression is suppressed in differentiated cells by tumor suppressor proteins that form a transcriptional repressive complex. We previously identified some of these proteins and found that their absence combined with deficiency in Trp53, leads to maximal dysregulated expression of Sox2. Using cancer cell lines of different origin and with different p53 status, we show here that manipulating TP53 to restore or decrease its activity results in repression or induction of SOX2, respectively. Mechanistically, we observed that the regulation of SOX2 expression by TP53 is transcriptional and identified Trp53 bound to the promoter region and the SRR2 enhancer of Sox2. Forcing high levels of SOX2 in cancer cells leads to morphological changes that molecularly correspond to the acquisition of a more mesenchymal phenotype correlating with an increased migratory capacity. Finally, the analysis of human breast cancer samples shows that this correlation between TP53 status, levels of expression of SOX2 and a more metastatic phenotype is also observed in cancer patients. Our results support the notion that lack of TP53 in tumor cells results in deregulated expression of developmental gene SOX2 with phenotypic consequences related with increased malignization.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Despite ongoing surveillance and control measures recommended by animal and public health authorities to limit viral spread, new herds continue to report infections. We show here that the continued spread between farms could be explained by the rapid pace of pathogen spread reported within farms, which greatly limits the potential effectiveness of these recommendations. Under reasonable surveillance strategies, we show that the time farms have to mobilize interventions is extremely limited, as few as a couple days and typically less than a week. Our findings suggest that passive surveillance measures, such as detection of H5N1 via weekly bulk milk testing, comes too late such that most infections have already occurred. For current interventions to be valuable, more sensitive and extensive surveillance is needed and an emphasis should be placed on biosecurity practices rather than reactive practices.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Here, we describe the firing responses of over 1000 neurons, and mesoscale field potentials from over 1400 microwires and 1500 iEEG contacts in 21 awake neurosurgical patients with implanted electrodes during written and spoken sentence comprehension. Using forward modeling of temporal receptive fields, we determined which sensory or abstract dimensions are encoded. We observed a double dissociation between superior temporal neurons sensitive to phonemes and phonological features and previously unreported ventral occipito-temporal neurons sensitive to letters and orthographic features. We also discovered novel neurons, primarily located in middle temporal and inferior frontal areas, which are modality-independent and show responsiveness to higher linguistic features. Overall, these findings show how language processing can be linked to neural dynamics, across multiple brain regions at various resolutions and down to the level of single neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Yet, in situ peptide identification remains challenging. Therefore, this study aims to integrate the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS)-based parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) into MALDI imaging of peptides to enable multiplexed MS/MS imaging.

METHODSAn initial MALDI TIMS MS1 survey measurement is performed, followed by a manual generation of a precursor list containing mass over charge values and ion mobility windows. Inside the dual TIMS system, submitted precursors are trapped, separately eluted by their ion mobility and analyzed in a quadrupole time-of-flight device, thereby enabling multiplexed MALDI MS/MS imaging. Finally, precursors are identified by peptide to spectrum matching.

RESULTSThis study presents the first multiplexed MALDI TIMS MS/MS imaging (iprm-PASEF) of tryptic peptides. Its applicability is showcased on two histomorphologically distinct tissue specimens in a 4-plex and 5-plex setup. Precursors were successfully identified by the search engine MASCOT in one single MALDI imaging experiment for each respective tissue. Peptide identifications were corroborated by liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry experiments and fragment colocalization analyses.

CONCLUSIONSIn the present study, we demonstrate the feasibility of TIMS-based MALDI MS/MS imaging for the multiplexed and rapid identification of tryptic peptides in a spatial manner. Hence, it represents a first step in the integration of MALDI imaging into the emerging field of spatial proteomics.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Here we propose scCompass, which provides a data quality solution to build a large-scale, cross-species and model-friendly single-cell data collection. By applying standardized data pre-processing, scCompass integrates and curates transcriptomic data from 13 species and nearly 105 million single cells. Using this extensive dataset, we are able to archieve stable expression genes (SEGs) and organ-specific expression genes (OSGs) in human and mouse. We provide different scalable datasets that can be easily adapted for AI model training and the pretrained checkpoints with state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-cell foundataion models.

Conditions that disrupt the immune balance in the male reproductive tract, such as vasectomy and infections, can expose sperm to the immune system, leading to increased production of anti-sperm antibodies (ASAs) and subsequent reproductive challenges. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) regulate inflammation and maintain sperm tolerance. In a murine model, we demonstrated that disrupting sperm immunotolerance induces chronic autoimmune responses characterized by antibody production targeting sperm and reproductive tissue autoantigens and unique tissue-specific immune cell signatures in the epididymis and testis. Such inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive sustained male subfertility. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were formed within the epididymis after Treg depletion, defined by clusters of heterogenous B and T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. These ectopic structures perpetuate inflammation and lower the activation threshold for future immune threats. Similar isotypes of autoantibodies were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting shared mechanistic pathways between mice and humans. Overall, we provide an in-depth understanding of the diverse B- and T-cell dynamics and TLS formation during epididymitis to develop precision-targeted therapies for infertility and chronic inflammation. Additionally, this immunological characterization of the epididymal microenvironment has the potential to identify novel targets for the development of male contraceptives.

However, metagenome-assembled genomes are often incomplete and have low contiguity due to challenges in assembling repeated genomic elements. Long-read sequencing approaches have successfully yielded circular bacterial genomes directly from metagenomes, but these approaches are low throughput, have high DNA input requirements, and can have high error rates. Illumina has recently launched the Illumina Complete Long Read (ICLR) assay, a new approach for generating kilobase-scale reads with low DNA input requirements and high accuracy. Here, we evaluate the performance of ICLR sequencing for gut metagenomics. We sequenced a microbial mock community and ten human gut microbiome samples with standard, shotgun 2x150 paired-end sequencing, ICLR sequencing, and nanopore long-read sequencing and compared performance in read lengths, assembly contiguity, and bin quality. We find that ICLR human metagenomic assemblies have higher N50 (119.5 {+/-} 24.8 kilobases) than short read assemblies (9.9 {+/-} 4.5 kilobases; p = 0.002), and comparable N50 to nanopore assemblies (91.0 {+/-} 43.8 kilobases; p = 0.32).

We used public RNA sequencing data and reconstructed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires from blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from patients with HP, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and healthy controls. After excluding TCR sequences likely to be related to common microbial exposures in patients with HP, we identified TCRs shared between patients with shared human leukocyte antigen alleles, indicating patients likely to have a common causative antigen. We also identified clusters of TCRs containing identical and similar TCR clones in individual patients that are plausibly related to the causative antigens in those patients.

We used polarized human trophoblast stem cell organoids and human placenta explants to demonstrate that OROV (BeAn19991) infects and replicates in human tissues of the maternal-fetal interface including chorionic villi and the microbial-resistant cell, syncytiotrophoblast.

With the emergence of subclade Ib and increasing reported human-to-human transmission of MPXV we sought to characterize both the epidemiologic and genomic characteristics of confirmed mpox cases in Kinshasa, DRC, following confirmed MPXV introduction in August 2023. Methods: This retrospective observational study leveraged demographic and case-investigation data, as well as biological samples, collected from suspected mpox cases in Kinshasa from January 2023 to September 2024 as part of routine national surveillance. Samples were tested at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale first by qPCR to confirm MPXV, and subsequently sequenced for genomic analysis for those samples with a cycle threshold value <31. Findings: Epidemiological characterization of all confirmed mpox cases in Kinshasa indicated two distinct periods of MPXV introduction and circulation: first, following the initial case in August 2023, self-limiting transmission chains of subclade Ia primarily among men. Case investigations from this period suggest human human transmission. The second period is marked by the introduction of subclade Ib to the city and expanded co-circulation of both subclades with Limete health zone reporting the most cases of both subclades. Of those samples sequenced, genomic analysis indicated that greater than 60% of mutations in both subclades were consistent with APOBEC3-driven mutations. Interpretation: These data suggest that as of July 2024, MPXV in Kinshasa has undergone an epidemiological shift with sustained human-to-human transmission and co-circulation of two distinct subclades. Additionally, high rates of APOBEC3-driven changes further support this shift towards human-to-human transmission. While sexual-contact transmission cannot be confirmed without further case investigation, these data highlight important changes in mpox dynamics which may better guide mpox mitigation and containment strategies in Kinshasa.","NA","medrxiv",1731967765214

Gain-of-function research restrictions preclude assessing human adapting mutations of 2.3.4.4b H5N1. Here, we tracked the evolution of 2.3.4.4b H5N1 that infected non-human mammals and evaluated their ability to gain human adaptations. The non-human mammal 2.3.4.4b H5N1 partly acquired classical human adapting mutations, which are identical to the residues of H1N1pdm09 and seasonal human H3N2 infections while showing a few species-specific adaptations that might be potential barriers for successful human adaptations. Despite minimal changes in Hemagglutinin (HA), A160T and T199I mutations near the receptor binding site of HA in dairy cattle viruses indicate the rapid HA glycan surface evolution affecting virus entry and immune evasion. The quantitative assessment indicated that 2.3.4.4b H5N1 circulating in bears, cattle, dolphins, and foxes show higher human adaptive potential than other hosts. Also, H5N1 infections in mammals across time showed a unique set of adaptations in the 2.3.4.4b clade compared to previously circulating strains, especially the acquisition of Q591 adaptation in PB2 that enables human adaptation. Thus, 2.3.4.4b H5N1 acquires human adaptations due to natural selection pressure in non-human mammals. Overall, our study delineates human adaptation and infection risk of specific non-human mammalian circulating HPAI 2.3.4.4b H5N1 strains.

Here we developed IMMClock, a novel immune aging clock that uses gene expression data to predict the biological age of individual CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, and NK cells. The accuracy of IMMClock is first validated across multiple independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness. Second, utilizing the IMMClock, we find that intrinsic cellular aging processes are more strongly altered during immune aging than differentiation processes. Thirdly, our analysis confirms the strong associations between immune aging and established processes such as cellular senescence, exhaustion, and telomere length at the single cell level. Furthermore, immune aging is accelerated under several disease conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Finally, we apply IMMClock to analyze a perturb-seq gene activation screen of T cell functionality. We find that the post-perturbation immune age of individual T cells is strongly correlated with their pre-perturbation immune age. Furthermore, the immune age at resting state of individual T cells is strongly predictive of their post-stimulation activation state. Overall, IMMClock advances our understanding of immune aging by providing precise, single-cell level age estimations. Its future applications hold promise for identifying interventions that concomitantly rejuvenate and activate T cells, potentially enhancing efforts to counteract age-related immune decline.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

The recent development of wearable technology for infants enables the collection of large-scale multimodal data in the natural environment, including physiological signals. To capitalize on these new technologies, psychologists need methods to efficiently extract valid and robust SA measures from large datasets. In this study, we present an innovative automatic sustained attention prediction (ASAP) method that harnesses electrocardiogram (ECG) and accelerometer (Acc) signals recorded with wearable sensors from 75 infants (6-, 9-, 12-, 24- and 36-months). Infants undertook various naturalistic tasks similar to those encountered in their natural environment, including free play with their caregivers. Annotated SA was validated by fixation signals from eye-tracking. ASAP was trained on temporal and spectral features derived from the ECG and Acc signals to detect attention periods, and tested against human-coded SA. ASAP's performance is similar across all age groups, demonstrating its suitability for studying development. We also investigated the relationship between attention periods and low-level perceptual features (visual saliency, visual clutter) extracted from the egocentric videos recorded during caregiver-infant free play. Saliency increased during attention vs inattention periods and decreased with age for attention (but not inattention) periods. Crucially, there was no observable difference in results from ASAP attention detection relative to the human-coded attention. Our results demonstrate that ASAP is a powerful tool for detecting infant SA elicited in natural environments.

While significant progresses have been made, the exact atomistic arrangement of nucleosomes remains controversial. Using a well-calibrated residue-level coarse-grained model and advanced dynamics modeling techniques, particularly the non-Markovian dynamics model, we map the free energy landscape of tetra-nucleosome systems, identify both metastable conformations and intermediate states in folding pathways, and quantify the folding kinetics. Our findings show that chromatin with 10n base pairs (bp) DNA linker lengths favor zigzag fibril structures. However, longer linker lengths destabilize this conformation. When the linker length is 10n+5 bp, chromatin loses unique conformations, favoring a dynamic ensemble of structures resembling folding intermediates. Embedding the tetra-nucleosome in a nucleosome condensate similarly shifts stability towards folding intermediates as a result of the competition of inter-nucleosomal contacts. These results suggest that chromatin organization observed in vivo arises from the unfolding of fibril structures due to nucleosome crowding and linker length variation. This perspective aids in unifying experimental studies to develop atomistic models for chromatin.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

In the context of natural selection analyses, specifically codon evolutionary models, excessive rates of false positives result. A characteristic signature of error-driven findings is unrealistically high estimates of dN/dS (e.g., >100), affecting only a small fraction (e.g., ~0.1%) of the alignment. Despite the widespread use of codon models to assess alignment quality, their potential for error correction remains unexplored. We present BUSTED-E: a novel method designed to detect positive selection while concurrently identifying alignment errors. This method is a straightforward adaptation of the BUSTED flexible branch-site random effects model used to fit distributions of dN/dS, with an important modification: it integrates an ""error-sink"" component representing an abiological evolutionary regime (dN/dS > 100), and provides the option for masking errors in the MSA for downstream analyses. Statistical performance of BUSTED-E on data simulated without errors shows that there is a small loss of power, which can be mitigated by model averaged inference. Using four published empirical datasets, we show BUSTED-E reduces unrealistic rates of positive selection detection, often by an order of magnitude, and improves biological interpretability of results. BUSTED-E also detects errors that are largely distinct from other popular alignment cleaning tools (HMMCleaner and BMGE). Overall, BUSTED-E is a robust and scalable solution for improving the accuracy of evolutionary analyses in the presence of residual alignment errors, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of natural selection and adaptive evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

IGF-1 gene is highly conserved across species, with only few evolutionary changes identified in it. Despite its potential role in regulating life span, no coding variants in IGF-1 have been reported in human longevity cohorts to date. This study investigated the whole exome sequencing data from 2,487 individuals in a cohort of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians, their offspring, and controls without familial longevity to identify functional IGF-1 coding variants. We identified two likely functional coding variants IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu and IGF-1:p.Ala118Thr in our longevity cohort. Notably, a centenarian specific novel variant IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu was located at the binding interface of IGF-1 - IGF-1R, whereas IGF-1:p.Ala118Thr was significantly associated with lower circulating levels of IGF-1. We performed extended all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the impact of Ile91Leu on stability, binding dynamics and energetics of IGF-1 bound to IGF-1R. The IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu formed less stable interactions with IGF-1Rs critical binding pocket residues and demonstrated lower binding affinity at the extracellular binding site compared to wild-type IGF-1. Our findings suggest that IGF-1:p.Ile91Leu and IGF-1:p.Ala118Thr variants attenuate IGF-1R activity by impairing IGF-1 binding and diminishing the circulatory levels of IGF-1, respectively. Consequently, diminished IGF-1 signaling resulting from these variants may contribute to exceptional longevity in humans.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

We identified a homozygous human WNT11 variant in an infant with Situs inversus totalis, complex heart defects and renal hypodysplasia, and we used Xenopus embryos to functionally characterize this variant. WNT11c.814delG encodes a loss-of-function protein with reduced stability that lost signaling activity in vivo. This is remarkable, because the variant encodes a truncated ligand with nearly identical length and predicted structure to dominant-negative Wnts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alteration of the truncated C-terminal end can restore stability and dominant-negative signaling activity. Our study also suggests similar functions for WNT11 in human development as described in model organisms. Therefore, biallelic WNT11 dysfunction should be considered as novel genetic cause in syndromal human phenotypes presenting with congenital heart defects and renal hypoplasia, with or without laterality defects. The work presented here enhances our understanding of human development and structure-function relationships in Wnt ligands.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

However, null space theory makes the counter-intuitive prediction that neurons often generate spikes not to cause behavior, but to prevent the effects that other neurons would have on behavior. What is missing is a direct way to test this theory in the brain. Here, we found that in the marmoset cerebellum, spike-triggered averaging identified a potent vector unique to each Purkinje cell (P-cell) along which the spikes of that cell displaced the eyes. Yet, the P-cells were active not just for saccades along their potent vector, but for all saccades. Simultaneous recordings revealed that two spikes in two different P-cells produced superposition of their potent vectors. The result was a population activity in which the spikes were canceled if their contributions were perpendicular to the intended movement. But why was one neuron producing spikes that would be canceled by another neuron? To answer this question, we recorded from the mossy fiber inputs and the interneurons in the molecular layer. We found that the mossy fibers provided a copy of the motor commands as well as the sensory goal of the movement, then the interneurons transformed these inputs so that the P-cells as a population predicted when the movement had reached the goal and should be stopped. Because this output had faster dynamics than was present in the individual neurons, the cerebellum placed the cells in subtractive competition with each other such that the downstream effects of spiking in one neuron were partially or completely eliminated because of the spiking in another neuron.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Dopamine (DA)-neurons play a central role in this process by modulating responses to both rewarding and aversive cues. DA-neurons are tightly and readily modulated by DA D2 autoreceptors (autoD2Rs), but their role in regulating responses to aversive stimuli remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of autoD2R in regulating the activity of VTA DA-neurons in response to salient aversive stimuli. Using Drd2Slc6a3 mice, in which Drd2 is selectively deleted in DA-neurons, we observed enhanced excitatory and inhibitory responses of VTA DA-neurons to aversive stimuli, suggesting that autoD2R acts as a critical regulatory brake. Importantly, this modulation occurred independently of either the pacemaker activity of DA-neurons or their coupling to the non-selective sodium leak channel NALCN. Behaviorally, Drd2Slc6a3 male mice showed enhanced discrimination between threat-predicting and non-predicting cues that persisted during extinction learning, highlighting a sex-biased role of autoD2R in threat processing. Our results provide new mechanistic insights through which autoD2R influence behavioral responses to aversive stimuli, with implications for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive threat processing.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Having well-curated benchmarking datasets has allowed machine learning experts to enter and revolutionise various fields of bioinformatics, such as protein structure prediction. Here, we present a set of benchmarking datasets for the yet unsolved task of accurate microRNA (miRNA) binding site prediction. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. miRNAs are loaded onto Argonaute family proteins (AGO) and serve as guides to target specific binding sites on messenger RNA through partial sequence complementarity, the exact rules of which remain to be fully understood. The precise identification of miRNA binding sites is crucial for the further understanding of these master regulators of gene expression. Despite decades of attempts to accurately predict miRNA binding sites, the field has been unable to conclusively determine the exact rules of miRNA binding. An important issue is the relative paucity of unbiased experimental datasets that could be used to train more accurate machine learning models. In recent years, novel experimental approaches have revolutionised the field, producing thousands of unbiased miRNA-binding site sequence pairs. Recently, over one million such pairs were produced and made publicly available, posing the potential to revolutionise the field. In this manuscript, we process and produce several comprehensive, well-annotated, and easy-to-use benchmark datasets from these experimental approaches. We use these datasets to benchmark state-of-the-art methods. We make the benchmarking datasets easy to access programmatically with a few lines of Python code, aiming to stimulate further machine learning research in the field by lowering the barrier to entry for machine learning experts into the field of miRNA binding site prediction.

In deep-sea cold seep ecosystems, where diverse microbial communities thrive, quorum sensing is likely a key mechanism driving microbial interactions. However, the distribution, mechanisms, and ecological roles of quorum sensing in cold seeps remain poorly understood. To address this, we analyzed 173 metagenomes, 33 metatranscriptomes, and 18 metabolomes from 17 global cold seep sites. We identified 299,355 quorum sensing genes from the seep non-redundant gene catalog, representing 34 gene types across six quorum sensing systems, with distribution patterns influenced by sediment depth and seep type. These quorum sensing genes were present in 3,576 metagenome-assembled genomes from 12 archaeal and 108 bacterial phyla, revealing a complex network of intraspecies and interspecies communication. Microbial groups involved in key metabolic processes, such as sulfate-reducing bacteria, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, diazotrophs and organohalide reducers, were extensively regulated by quorum sensing, influencing biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Phylogenetic analysis and protein domain identification highlighted the functional roles of key quorum sensing-related proteins (e.g., PDEs, CahR, RpfC/G and LuxR) in modulating microbial behaviors, such as motility and chemotaxis. Heterologous expression and metabolomic profiling further confirmed the activity of representative LuxI-R pairs and identified inhibitors of quorum sensing in cold seep sediments. Overall, these findings highlight complexity and significance of quorum sensing in microbial interactions, ecological adaptation, and biogeochemical cycling within cold seep ecosystems, advancing our understanding of microbial communication in the deep biosphere.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

Here we introduce DEGU (Distilling Ensembles for Genomic Uncertainty-aware models), a method that integrates ensemble learning and knowledge distillation to improve the robustness and explainability of DNN predictions. DEGU distills the predictions of an ensemble of DNNs into a single model, capturing both the average of the ensemble's predictions and the variability across them, with the latter representing epistemic (or model-based) uncertainty. DEGU also includes an optional auxiliary task to estimate aleatoric, or data-based, uncertainty by modeling variability across experimental replicates. By applying DEGU across various functional genomic prediction tasks, we demonstrate that DEGU-trained models inherit the performance benefits of ensembles in a single model, with improved generalization to out-of-distribution sequences and more consistent explanations of cis-regulatory mechanisms through attribution analysis. Moreover, DEGU-trained models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, with conformal prediction offering coverage guarantees under minimal assumptions. Overall, DEGU paves the way for robust and trustworthy applications of deep learning in genomics research.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

The mechanisms driving neuroendocrine-tuft tumour heterogeneity, and the origins of tuft-like cancers are unknown. Using multiple genetically-engineered animal models of SCLC, we demonstrate that a basal cell of origin (but not the accepted neuroendocrine origin) generates neuroendocrine-tuft-like tumours that highly recapitulate human SCLC. Single-cell clonal analyses of basal-derived SCLC further uncovers unexpected transcriptional states and lineage trajectories underlying neuroendocrine-tuft plasticity. Uniquely in basal cells, introduction of genetic alterations enriched in human tuft-like SCLC, including high MYC, PTEN loss, and ASCL1 suppression, cooperate to promote tuft-like tumours. Transcriptomics of 944 human SCLCs reveal a basal-like subset and a tuft-ionocyte-like state that altogether demonstrate remarkable conservation between cancer states and normal basal cell injury response mechanisms. Together, these data suggest that the basal cell is a plausible origin for SCLC and other neuroendocrine-tuft cancers that can explain neuroendocrine-tuft heterogeneity-offering new insights for targeting lineage plasticity.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765214

However, weight regain occurs when treatment is discontinued. An increase in skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) efficiency upon diet-mediated weight loss has been described, which may contribute to reduced systemic energy expenditure and weight regain. We set out to determine the unknown effect of semaglutide on muscle OXPHOS efficiency. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks before receiving semaglutide or vehicle for 1 or 3 weeks. The rate of ATP production and O2 consumption were measured by a high-resolution respirometry and fluorometry to determine OXPHOS efficiency in skeletal muscle at these 2 timepoints. Results: Semaglutide treatment led to significant reductions in fat and lean mass. Semaglutide improved skeletal muscle OXPHOS efficiency, measured as ATP produced per O2 consumed (P/O) in permeabilized muscle fibers. Mitochondrial proteomic analysis revealed changes restricted to two proteins linked to complex III assembly (Lyrm7 and Ttc1, p < 0.05 without multiple corrections) without substantial changes in the abundance of OXPHOS subunits. Conclusions: These data indicate that weight loss with semaglutide treatment increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency. Future studies could test whether it contributes to weight regain.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

We show that new paralogues mainly originated through retroposition, and that only a few new copies retain coding capacity over time. Although transcriptionally active non-canonical RP paralogues often present tissue-specific expression, we show that the majority of those are not required for either viability or fertility in Drosophila melanogaster. The only exception, RpS5b, which is required for oogenesis, is functionally interchangeable with its canonical paralogue, indicating that the RpS5b-/- phenotype results from insufficient ribosomes rather than the absence of an RpS5b-specific, functionally-specialised ribosome.

While this technique holds significant potential for clinical and cognitive applications, the causal mechanisms underlying successful DecNef regulation and the neural dynamics that distinguish successful learners from those who struggle remain poorly understood. To address this question, we conducted a meta-study across functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from five DecNef experiments, each with multiple fMRI sessions, to reveal causal network dynamics associated with individual differences in neurofeedback performance. Using the newly proposed CaLLTiF causal discovery method, we computed causal maps to identify causal network patterns that distinguish DecNef regulation from baseline and account for variations in neurofeedback success. We found that enhanced connectivity within the bilateral control network--particularly stronger connections involving the posterior cingulate and precuneus cortex--predicted neurofeedback success across all five studies. Whole-brain causal connectivity during DecNef further exhibited distinct network reorganizations, characterized by reduced average path lengths and increased right-limbic nodal degrees. Further, comparisons across cognition- and perception-targeted DecNef revealed a remarkable separation in connections to and from the somatomotor network, where connections between somatomotor and control-default-attention networks are larger during cognitive neurofeedback while causal effects between somatomotor and subcortical-visual-limbic networks are larger during perceptive DecNef. This is despite the fact that none of the involved studies targeted or involved motor activity. Overall, our results demonstrated the key role of bilateral medial control network in successful DecNef regulation regardless of the DecNef targets, a clear separation in somatomotor involvement between cognitive and perceptive DecNef, and general promise of whole-brain causal discovery in understanding complex neural processes such as decoded neurofeedback.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Because chronic infections may last for decades, they have the potential to generate high levels of intraspecific variation through within-host diversification over time, and the potential for superinfections to occur through the introduction of multiple pathogen populations to the ongoing infection. Traditional methods for identifying infective agents generally involve isolating one single colony from a given sample, usually after selecting for a specific pathogen or antibiotic resistance profile. Isolating a recognized virulent or difficult to treat pathogen is an important part of informing clinical treatment and correlative research; however, these reductive methods alone, do not provide researchers or healthcare providers with the potentially important perspective on the true pathogen population structure and dynamics over time. To begin to address this limitation, in this study, we compare findings on Staphylococcus aureus single colonies versus and pools of colonies taken from fresh sputum samples from three patients with cystic fibrosis to isolates collected from the same sputum samples and processed by the clinical microbiology laboratory. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of isolated S. aureus populations revealed coexisting lineages in two of three sputum samples as well as population structures that were not reflected in the single colony isolates.

While most antibiotics have traditionally been derived from bacteria and fungi, archaea, a distinct and underexplored domain of life, offer a largely untapped reservoir for antibiotic discovery. In this study, we leveraged deep learning to systematically explore the archaeome, uncovering promising new candidates for combating AMR. By mining 233 archaeal proteomes, we identified 12,623 molecules with potential antimicrobial activity. These newly discovered peptide compounds, termed archaeasins, exhibit unique compositional features that differentiate them from traditional antimicrobial peptides, including a distinct amino acid profile. We synthesized 80 archaeasins, 93% of which demonstrated antimicrobial activity in vitro. Notably, in vivo validation identified archaeasin-73 as a lead candidate, significantly reducing bacterial loads in mouse infection models, with effectiveness comparable to established antibiotics like polymyxin B. Our findings highlight the immense potential of archaea as a resource for developing next-generation antibiotics.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Transducing bacteriophage (phage) particles and gene transfer agents (GTAs) are constrained by their capsids' structural properties in the length of host DNA they can package. This results in a narrow distribution of DNA fragment lengths associated with a given viral carrier. Single molecule nanopore sequencing of intact capsid-packaged single DNA molecules with full genome-sized reads can be used to establish the precise lengths and identity of individual packaged DNA molecules and their association with specific bacterial hosts and virus-like agents. The approach developed in this study was validated using a selection of well-characterised transducing phages and a GTA-like element, and then applied to study bacterial DNA encapsidation in the faecal microbiomes from three healthy human donors. Bacterial DNA encapsidation by viruses and virus-like particles appears to be widespread in the microbiome with up to 5.4% of capsid-packaged DNA in the gut virome being of bacterial (non-prophage) origin. Generalised transduction and GTA activity are especially prevalent in the families Ospillospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (genera Faecalibacterium, Gemmiger, Onthomonas), whereas an example of lateral transduction was observed in genus Bacteroides. In addition to that, induction of prophages in a variety of highly prevalent anaerobic bacteria was observed. Further work will be needed to understand biological significance of capsid-mediated DNA packaging in the gut microbiome and its role in community structure, evolution on ecological timescales, spread of beneficial and detrimental genes, as well as its possible role in gastrointestinal disease.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

In Crohns disease (CD) patients, the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, epithelium permeability is increased, and IECs present compositional and functional defects. The role of T lymphocytes interactions with IECs in the physiopathology of CD remains in question. Here, we use a three-dimensional human autologous coculture model between purified intestinal organoids derived from primary tissues of CD and non-inflammatory control patients, and mucosal T lymphocytes extracted from the same location. We show that while in homeostatic context T cells support the proliferation and differentiation balance of organoids, mucosal T lymphocytes from CD patients present a high cytotoxicity against IECs. Importantly, this cytotoxicity is a persistent defect overtime in culture. Organoids also show defective intestinal stem cells (ISCs) proliferation and morphological changes. Single cell RNA sequencing after coculture highlights a general response of T cells to the epithelial microenvironment, and more particularly, an increase activation of a pro-inflammatory CD8+ T cells effector population in CD patients compared to controls.

However, the functional mechanisms of these proteins remain largely unexplored. In our previous research, we identified a CSP in aphid saliva, Mp10, from the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae, which functions as an effector protein modulating host plant immunity. Mp10 suppresses pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-triggered immunity (PTI), the first layer of plant defence, while also inducing effector-triggered immunity (ETI). In this study, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Mp10 suppresses PTI. Our findings reveal that Mp10 interacts with AMSH deubiquitinase enzymes in plants, as shown by yeast two-hybrid, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and FRET-FLIM assays, with these interactions predominantly localized to intracellular membranes. Mp10 was found to modulate the dynamics of membrane-bound PRR receptor kinases in plant cells. Co-IP and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that Mp10 and AMSH2 associate with a range of PRR kinases, PRR-associated kinases, and proteins involved in the intracellular trafficking of membrane proteins. Mp10 reduces the accumulation of these kinases at the cell surface by promoting their internalization to internal membranes, thereby dampening PTI. Supporting this, a dominant-negative catalytically inactive variant of AMSH2 also inhibits PTI. Interestingly, Mp10 orthologues from other sap-feeding hemipteran insects exhibit similar immune-suppressive activities, and our findings show that their interaction with plant AMSH proteins is conserved, indicating this immune-suppression mechanism is evolutionarily ancient.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Here, we benchmark four prominent peak calling tools - MACS2, SEACR, GoPeaks, and LanceOtron - evaluating their performance in identifying peaks from CUT&RUN datasets. Our analysis utilizes in-house data of three histone marks (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) from mouse brain tissue, as well as samples from the 4DNucleome database. We systematically assess these tools based on parameters such as the number of peaks called, peak length distribution, signal enrichment, and reproducibility across biological replicates. Our findings reveal substantial variability in peak calling efficacy, with each method demonstrating distinct strengths in sensitivity, precision, and applicability depending on the histone mark in question.

Genealogy-based association methods have the potential to bridge this gap by testing combinations of common and rare haplotypes based purely on their ancestral relationships. In parallel work we developed an efficient local ancestry inference engine and a novel statistical method (LOCATER) for combining signals present on different branches of a locus specific haplotype tree. Here, we developed a genome-wide LOCATER analysis pipeline and applied it to a genome sequencing study of 6,795 Finnish individuals with 101 cardiometabolic traits and 18.9 million autosomal variants. We identified 351 significant trait associations at 47 genomic loci and found that LOCATER boosted single marker test (SMT) association power at 5 loci by combining independent signals from distinct alleles. LOCATER successfully recovered known quantitative trait loci not found by SMT, including LIPG, recovered known allelic heterogeneity at the APOE/C1/C4/C2 gene cluster, and suggested one novel association. We find that confounders have a more pronounced effect on genealogy-based methods than SMT; we propose a new randomization approach and a general method for genomic control to eliminate their effects. This study demonstrates that genealogy-based methods such as LOCATER excel when multiple causal variants are present and suggests that their application to larger and more diverse cohorts will be fruitful.","NA","medrxiv",1731967765215

Impaired peroxisome assembly causes severe multisystemic failure with patient phenotypes ranging from epilepsy, liver disease, feeding issues, biochemical abnormalities, and neurodegeneration. Variants in the same PEX gene can produce wide differences in severity, ranging from individuals with death in the first year of life to adults with milder complications. To study this strong genotype-phenotype correlation, we selected specific human PEX gene mutations and utilized Drosophila as a model organism. We generated flies replacing the coding sequence of our Pex gene of interest with a KozakGAL4 (KZ) promoter trap sequence. These cassettes simultaneously knock-out of the Pex gene and knock-in a GAL4 driver, ideal for making ""humanized"" flies in which the human PEX gene can replace the fly loss. We assessed Pex2KZ and Pex16KZ lines in lifespan, bang sensitivity, and climbing assays and confirmed that these are strong loss-of-function alleles. In parallel, we generated human reference and variant UAS-cDNA lines of PEX2 and PEX16 variants in Drosophila. We observed nearly complete phenotypic rescue of Drosophila Pex2 and Pex16 loss when human PEX2Ref or PEX16Ref, respectively, were expressed. We also provide evidence for an allele severity spectrum in PEX2 and PEX16 in which some missense alleles, such as PEX2C247R, are equally severe as early truncations, such as PEX2R119*. We also observed that alleles associated with mild PBD, such as PEX2E55K, show variability depending on the assay but do not fully rescue. Finally, alleles associated with atypical ataxia phenotypes, such as PEX16F332Del, can perform as well as PEX16Ref, depending on the assay. Altogether, these Drosophila lines effectively model the range of severity of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Human skin undergoes both chronological aging and environmental degradation, particularly UV-induced photoaging. Detrimental structural and physiological changes caused by aging include epidermal thinning due to stem cell depletion and dermal atrophy associated with decreased collagen production. Here, we present a comprehensive single-cell atlas of skin aging, analyzing samples from young, middle-aged, and elderly individuals, including both sun-exposed and sun-protected areas. This atlas reveals age-related cellular composition and function changes across various skin cell types, including epidermal stem cells, fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Using our atlas, we have identified basal stem cells as a highly variable population across aging, more so than other skin cell populations such as fibroblasts. In basal stem cells, we identified ATF3 as a novel regulator of skin aging. ATF3 is a transcriptional factor for genes involved in the aging process, with its expression reduced by 20% during aging. Based on this discovery, we have developed an innovative mRNA-based treatment to mitigate the effects of skin aging. Cell senescence decreased 25% in skin cells treated with ATF3 mRNA, and we observed an over 20% increase in proliferation in treated basal stem cells. Importantly, we also found crosstalk between keratinocytes and fibroblasts as a critical component of therapeutic interventions, with ATF3 rescue of basal cells significantly enhancing fibroblast collagen production by approximately 200%. We conclude that ATF3-targeted mRNA treatment effectively reverses the effects of skin aging by modulating specific cellular mechanisms, offering a novel, targeted approach to human skin rejuvenation.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Oligodendrocyte maturation impacts the cell death mechanisms that occur in degenerative conditions, but it is unclear if and how the cell death machinery changes as OPCs transition into oligodendrocytes. Here, we discovered that differentiating oligodendrocytes transiently upregulate the zymogen procaspase-3, equipping these cells to make a survival decision during differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 decreases oligodendrocyte density, indicating that procaspase-3 upregulation promotes differentiation. Moreover, using procaspase-3 as a marker, we show that oligodendrocyte differentiation continues in the aging cortex and white matter.

So far, a well-known mammalian mutation PB2-E627K has not been maintained in AIV in poultry, which limits the spread of AIVs from avian to humans. Here, we discovered a variant, PB2-627V, which combines the properties of avian-like PB2-627E and human-like PB2-627K, overcoming host restrictions and posing a risk for human pandemics. Specifically, by screening the global PB2 sequences, we discovered a new independent cluster with PB2-627V emerged in the 2010s, which is prevalent in various avian, mammalian, and human isolates of AIVs, including H9N2, H7N9, H3N8, 2.3.4.4b H5N1, and other subtypes. And, the increasing prevalence of PB2-627V in poultry is accompanied by a rise in human infection cases with this variant. Then we systematically assessed its host adaptation, fitness, and transmissibility across three subtypes of AIVs (H9N2, H7N9, and H3N8) in different host models, including avian and human cells, chickens, mice, and ferrets where infections naturally occur. We found that PB2-627V facilitates AIVs to efficiently infect and replicate in chickens and mice by utilizing both avian- and human-origin ANP32A proteins. Importantly, and like PB2-627K, PB2-627V promotes efficient transmission between ferrets through respiratory droplets. Deep sequencing in passaged chicken samples and transmitted ferret samples indicates that PB2-627V remains stable across the two distinct hosts and has a high potential for long-term prevalence in avian species. Therefore, the mutation has the ability to continue spreading among poultry and can also overcome the barrier between birds and humans, greatly enhancing the likelihood of AIVs infecting humans. Given the escalating global spread of AIVs, it is crucial to closely monitor influenza viruses carrying PB2-627V to prevent a pandemic.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

While the role of nuclear movements in PSE has been extensively studied, less is known about whether and how their nuclear packing arrangements and changes of packing state influence tissue morphogenesis. To address this, we analyzed nuclear shapes, sizes and neighborhood statistics by segmenting nuclei in 3D and over development in zebrafish retinal neuroepithelia (RNE). We find that in PSE nuclei exhibit orientational, nematic-like order but remain positionally disordered. This pattern is conserved in other, less packed, neuroepithelia, like the hindbrain, suggesting that nematic-like order is a hallmark of pseudostratification. Our analysis during retinal development also revealed that nuclear packing density increases, approaching theoretical packing limits for disordered monodisperse ellipsoids at stages when the tissue transitions to a laminated neuronal structure. As neurogenesis progresses, nuclear shapes are remodeled, enabling the RNE to shift to a crystalline, ordered structure, while maintaining orientational alignment. Failure to initiate neurogenesis results in severe tissue deformations due to increased buckling instability. Our results thus show an instance where nuclear shape and nuclear positioning and their changes are essential for proper retinal morphogenesis, a phenomenon most likely also found in other tissue arrangements.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient is more accurate and is up to 50x faster than current state-of-the-art. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metients reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in many patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and further finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported. By removing the need for hard constraints on what patterns of metastatic spread are most likely, Metient introduces a way to further our understanding of cancer type-specific metastatic spread.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731967765215

Centrosomes consist of a pair of centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar material (PCM). In Caenorhabditis elegans, interactions between the PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 and the regulatory kinase PLK-1 are essential for PCM formation and disassembly. However, how PCM stability is established and maintained remains an open question. Here, we address this question by analyzing the function of PCMD-1, a protein that predominantly localizes to centrioles. Mutations in the predicted PLK-1 binding sites of PCMD-1 result in a reduction of centrosomal PLK-1 and PCMD-1 levels, leading to severe distortion of the PCM scaffold. The disorganization of the PCM is already evident during its formation and results in the assembly of a structurally unstable mitotic centrosome, which is unable to resist the microtubule pulling forces exerted on the spindle pole. As a consequence of a weakened PCM scaffold, the pulling forces are not effectively relayed to the entrapped centriole pair, resulting in delayed centriole separation in late anaphase. Together, these findings show that PCMD-1, which predominantly localizes to centrioles and tethers the PCM scaffold to them, is essential for stabilizing the entire PCM scaffold and ensuring timely centriole separation during PCM disassembly. We propose a model in which PCMD-1 initiates the ordered assembly of the PCM scaffold by biasing the PCM core to a certain intrinsic order around the centrioles. This intrinsic order acts as a seed that propagates throughout the surrounding micron-scale PCM scaffold, providing the necessary strength and structural integrity for the centrosome.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Tools like AlphaMissense leverage AlphaFold2 to predict missense variant pathogenicity with state of the art performance. However, AlphaMissense is deep learning-based, and its process to predict pathogenicity is opaque and does not explicitly predict the impact of missense variants on additional biophysical properties. Additionally, AlphaMissense is not publicly available, limiting accessibility. Here, we present AlphaRING, a publicly available tool that leverages AlphaFold2 and captures real physico chemical properties of variant residues to predict the pathogenicity of both characterised and uncharacterised missense variants. AlphaRING models wild-type and variant proteins using AlphaFold2 and identifies atomic level non covalent interactions via residue interaction network analysis using RING4. Unlike deep learning models, our scoring captures real physico chemical properties of mutated residues, providing interpretable insights into mutation effects. We developed novel formulas for each non-covalent bond type (hydrogen, ionic, {pi}-cation, {pi}-{pi} stacking, and {pi}-hydrogen), incorporating bond-specific energy and geometry values to calculate unique weighting scores per residue. The absolute log2 fold change between wild type and variant residue scores yields a non-negative AlphaRING score--the higher the score, the greater the predicted pathogenicity. Evaluating AlphaRING on over 1,300 human gold-standard missense variants curated by ClinVar expert panels, our results show effective distinction between benign and pathogenic variants, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.79. This strong performance suggests that AlphaRING is a reliable, open-source tool suitable for high throughput structural predictions and large scale variant characterisation, accessible to non experts. By enabling detailed exploration of the relationship between genetic variation and protein structure, AlphaRING addresses key limitations of previous models and paves the way for broader applications in genetic research and precision medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Yet, the repertoire of synthetic biocompatible wet adhesive materials is still limited. In most marine bioadhesive proteins, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) plays a significant role in strong interfacial interactions. The bioadhesive proteins in freshwater organisms are less well understood. The quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis) is a notorious freshwater invasive species in the Great Lakes that attaches to a plethora of surfaces via a byssus. To determine the adhesive proteins in the quagga mussel byssus, we utilized quantitative proteomics to identify the proteins enriched at the byssus-substrate interface. Among the identified proteins was the Dbfp7 protein family. Dbfp7 is a small, polymorphic, and mostly disordered protein that lacks significant amounts of DOPA. Atomic force microscopy measurements of Dbfp7 confirm that this protein has similar adhesion energy to marine mussel adhesive proteins in aqueous conditions despite lacking DOPA. These results suggest that freshwater mussels may employ different mechanisms of adhesion compared to marine byssates. The inclusion of Dbfp7 to the library of known wet bioadhesive proteins - the first functionally characterized freshwater bioadhesive protein to our knowledge - will allow for a better understanding of the fundamental properties required to achieve biocompatible wet adhesion, a crucial step for the development of bio-inspired wet adhesive materials, such as improved medical adhesives.

Significance StatementWhile many aquatic organisms evolved strategies to adhere to surfaces underwater, current synthetic biocompatible adhesives lack reliable adhesive strength in varying aqueous conditions. Investigating freshwater mussel adhesive proteins expands the current understanding of aquatic bioadhesion and offers potential advancements in wet adhesive technology. The discovery of a DOPA-deficient wet adhesive protein derived from the invasive quagga mussels presents a paradigm shift to the currently known mechanisms of byssal bioadhesion, thereby expanding the repertoire of wet adhesive strategies. Further, understanding the mechanism of adhesion employed by this biofouling species can help with the design of anti-fouling strategies to mitigate the impacts of these animals on the infrastructure and ecosystems in the Great Lakes and connected freshwater systems in North America.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Extreme precipitation events can promote the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses by creating vector habitat, destroying infrastructure, and impeding vector control. Here, we focus on Cyclone Yaku, which caused heavy rainfall in northwestern Peru from March 7th - 20th, 2023 and was followed by the worst dengue outbreak in Perus history. We apply generalized synthetic control methods to account for baseline climate variation and unobserved confounders when estimating the causal effect of Cyclone Yaku on dengue cases across the 56 districts with the greatest precipitation anomalies. We estimate that 67 (95% CI: 30 - 87) % of cases in cyclone-affected districts were attributable to Cyclone Yaku. The cyclone significantly increased cases for over six months, causing 38,209 (95% CI: 17,454 - 49,928) out of 57,246 cases. The largest increases in dengue incidence due to Cyclone Yaku occurred in districts with a large share of low-quality roofs and walls in residences, greater flood risk, and warmer temperatures above 24{degrees}C. Analyzing an ensemble of climate model simulations, we found that extremely intense March precipitation in northwestern Peru is 42% more likely in the current era compared to a preindustrial baseline due to climate forcing. In sum, extreme precipitation like that associated with Cyclone Yaku has become more likely with climate change, and Cyclone Yaku caused the majority of dengue cases across the cyclone-affected districts.

Significance StatementAnthropogenic climate change is increasing the risk of extreme events that can lead to infectious disease epidemics, but few studies have directly measured this health cost of climate change. We do so by focusing on Cyclone Yaku, which affected northwestern Peru in March 2023, and was immediately followed by a dengue epidemic. Cyclone Yaku caused 67% of cases reported over six months in the affected region. Industrial-era climate forcing has increased the likelihood of extreme March precipitation like that associated with Cyclone Yaku by 42%. Assessing the linkages between climate change, extreme weather, and outbreaks of dengue and other infectious diseases is crucial for understanding the impact that climate change has already had and preparing for future health risks.","NA","medrxiv",1731967765215

Numerous computational models on the EC propose that its grid cells serve as a spatial metric, supporting path integration and efficient generalization. However, little is known about how these cells could contribute to episodic memory, which emphasizes episode-specific representations that align with pattern separation. Taking into consideration anatomical specifications of EC inputs to the HPC and computational principles underlying the EC-HPC memory system, we argue that EC layer IIa (EC2a) supports pattern separation and EC layer IIb/III (EC2b/3) supports generalization. Utilizing recurrent inhibition and the nature of single EC2a neurons binding converging inputs from the neocortex (i.e., conjunctive coding), we built a biologically-based neural network model of the EC-HPC system for episodic memory. By examining how EC2a transformed its cortical inputs and output them to the trisynaptic pathway (EC2a - Dentate Gyrus - CA3 - CA1), we found that instead of systematically generalizing across similar inputs, recurrent inhibition and conjunctive coding in EC2a neurons support strong pattern separation and increase mnemonic discrimination. Furthermore, lesioning EC2a neurons in the model resembled memory impairments found in people with Alzheimers Disease, suggesting an intertwined relationship between memory and the majority of pure grid cells in the EC. On the other hand, the topographically organized monosynaptic pathway (EC2b/3 - CA1) is computationally more suitable for efficient factorization and generalization. This model provides novel anatomically-based predictions regarding the computational roles of EC cells in pattern separation and generalization, which together form a critical computational framework for both episodic memory and spatial navigation.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599.

In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1.

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Prior to testing whether aging biomarkers may be useful as surrogate endpoints, it is first necessary to determine whether they are responsive to interventions that target aging. Epigenetic clocks are aging biomarkers based on DNA methylation with prognostic value for many aging outcomes. Many individual studies are beginning to explore whether epigenetic clocks are responsive to interventions. However, the diversity of both interventions and epigenetic clocks in different studies make them difficult to compare systematically. Here, we curate TranslAGE-Response, a harmonized database of 51 public and private longitudinal interventional studies and calculate a consistent set of 16 prominent epigenetic clocks for each study, along with 95 other DNAm biomarkers that help explain changes in each clock. With this database, we discover patterns of responsiveness across a variety of interventions and DNAm biomarkers. For example, clocks trained to predict mortality or pace of aging have the strongest response across all interventions and show consistent agreement with each other, pharmacological and lifestyle interventions drive the strongest response from DNAm biomarkers, and study population and study duration are key factors in driving responsiveness of DNAm biomarkers in an intervention. Some classes of interventions such as TNF-alpha inhibitors have strong, consistent effects across multiple studies, while others such as senolytic drugs have inconsistent effects. Clocks with multiple sub-scores (i.e. ""explainable clocks"") provide specificity and greater mechanistic insight into responsiveness of interventions than single-score clocks. Our work can help the geroscience field design future clinical trials, by guiding the choice of interventions, specific subsets of epigenetic clocks to minimize multiple testing, study duration, study population, and sample size, with the eventual aim of determining whether epigenetic clocks can be used as surrogate endpoints.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731967765215
