However, direct observations of rapid genetic adaptation and population dynamics across climates are rare across species. To fill this gap, we conducted a replicated, globally synchronized evolution experiment with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana for 5 years in over 30 outdoor experimental gardens with distinct climates across Europe, the Levant, and North America. We performed whole-genome sequencing on [~]70,000 surviving reproductive individuals and directly observed rapid and repeatable adaptation across climates. Allele frequency changes over time were parallel in experimental evolution replicates within the same climates, while they diverged across contrasting climates--with some allele frequency shifts best explained by strong selection between -46% to +60%. Screening the genome for signals of rapid climate adaptation identified a polygenic architecture with both known and novel adaptive genetic variants connected to important ecological phenotypes including environmental stress responses, CAM5 and HEAT SHOCK FACTORs, and germination and spring flowering timing, CYTOCHROME P450s and TSF. We found evolutionary adaptation trends were often predictable, but variable across environments. In warm climates, high evolutionary predictability was associated with population survival up to 5 years, while erratic trends were an early warning for population extinction. Together, these results show rapid climate adaptation may be possible, but understanding its limits across species will be key for biodiversity forecasting.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Alberta s health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework. Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against one s conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives. Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

While generally described as positively charged amphipathic helices, presequences lack a consensus motif and thus likely promote the import of proteins into mitochondria with variable efficiencies. Indeed, the concept of presequence ""strength"" critically underlies biological models such as stress sensing, yet a quantitative analysis of what dictates ""strong"" versus ""weak"" presequences is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which presequence strength affects mitochondrial function and cellular fitness remains unclear. Here, we capitalize on the high-throughput and kinetic nature of the MitoLuc mitochondrial protein import assay to quantify multiple aspects of presequence strength. We find that select presequences, including those that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), are sufficient to impart differential import efficiencies during mitochondrial uncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that presequences beyond those classically associated with stress signaling promote highly variable import efficiency in stressed and basal (i.e., non-stressed) conditions in vitro, suggesting that presequence strength may influence a broader array of processes than currently appreciated. We exploit this variability to demonstrate that only presequences that promote robust import in vitro can fully rescue defects in respiratory growth in Complex IV-deficient yeast, suggesting that presequence strength dictates metabolic potential. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that presequence strength can describe numerous metrics, such as total imported protein, maximal import velocity, or sensitivity to uncoupling, suggesting that the annotation of presequences as ""weak"" versus ""strong"" requires more nuanced characterization than is typically performed. Importantly, we find that such variability in presequence strength meaningfully affects cellular fitness in processes beyond stress signaling, suggesting that organisms may broadly exploit presequence strength to fine-tune mitochondrial import and thus organellar homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

However, although chromatin plays an integral role in regulating the function of regulatory elements along the nuclear genome, our understanding of how, or whether, similar chromatin structures form on plasmids transfected into mammalian cells remains limited. We demonstrate that plasmid single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (plasmid Fiber-seq) can accurately map chromatin architectures along individual, full-length transfected plasmid molecules at near single-nucleotide resolution. Application of plasmid Fiber-seq to diverse plasmids and cell lines demonstrates that plasmids are chromatinized in a sequence-dependent organized manner and adopt a heterogeneous and incomplete chromatin architecture relative to nuclear-encoded chromatin fibers. We show that the focal occupancy of nucleosomes and transcription factors along transfected plasmids is central to their transcriptional activity within mammalian cells, and demonstrate that plasmids indeed are capable of recapitulating nuclear genome-encoded chromatin architectures, although not always. Finally, we demonstrate that combining plasmid Fiber-seq with high-throughput reporter assays can establish the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic non-coding variants, including disentangling the effects of transcriptional activators and repressors with near-single-nucleotide resolution. Overall, our findings reveal the principles by which plasmid-based assays can be used for accurate fine-scale mapping of chromatin-dependent regulatory grammar.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Single-cell transcriptomics provides a detailed picture of the cellular states observed during these decisions, but building quantitative and predictive models from these data remains a challenge. Here, we present dynamic landscape analysis (DLA), a framework that applies dynamical systems theory to identify stable cell states, map transition pathways, and generate a predictive cell fate decision landscape from single-cell data. Applying this framework to vertebrate neural tube development, we reveal that progenitor specification by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) can be captured in a landscape with an unexpected circular topology, where initially divergent lineages converge through multiple routes. This landscape accurately predicted cellular responses and cell fate allocation for unseen dynamic signalling regimes. By modelling the dynamic responses that drive cell fate decisions, the DLA framework provides a quantitative and generative framework for extracting mechanistic insights from high-dimensional single-cell data.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

They continue to be important therapeutic targets for multiple disorders including autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, and allergy-related conditions. Recent structural coverage has provided important insights into their activation and signaling, however, confounding observations in the literature related to ligand efficacy and functional responses, especially in different model systems, present a major challenge for drug discovery efforts. Here, we systematically and comprehensively profile a broad set of natural and synthetic ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 and discover a previously unanticipated level of functional specialization in terms of species-specific pharmacology and receptor activation. Taking a lead from this, we determine seventeen cryo-EM structures of different ligand-receptor-G-protein complexes and uncover distinct orientation of agonists between the human and mouse receptors despite an overlapping positioning in the orthosteric binding pocket. Combined with extensive mutagenesis and functional assays, these structural snapshots allow us to decode and validate a convergent molecular mechanism involving a ""Five-Point-Switch"" in these receptors that orchestrates the recognition and efficacy of diverse agonists. We also identify species-specific differences at the level of phosphorylation patterns encoded in the carboxyl-terminus of these receptors and directly visualize their impact on {beta}arr binding and activation using cryo-EM structures. Interestingly, we observe that {beta}arrs engage with the mouse C5aR1 using a variation of previously discovered P-X-P-P phosphorylation motif via a ""Sliding-Mechanism"" and also exhibit distinct oligomeric state for the human vs. mouse receptors. Taken together, this study elucidates functional specialization at the complement anaphylatoxin receptors and underlying molecular mechanisms, offering a previously lacking framework with direct and immediate implications for the development of novel therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Here, we revisit this question using one of the deepest metagenomic sequencing efforts to date, applying 148 Gbp of Nanopore long-read and 122 Gbp of Illumina short-read data to a single forest soil sample.

ResultsOur hybrid assembly reconstructed 837 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 466 high- and medium-quality genomes, nearly all lacking close relatives among cultivated taxa. Rarefaction and k-mer analyses reveal that, even at this depth, we capture only a fraction of the extant diversity: nonparametric models project that over 10 Tbp would be required to approach saturation. These findings offer a quantitative, technology-enabled update to long-standing diversity estimates and demonstrate that conventional metagenomic sequencing efforts likely miss the majority of microbial and biosynthetic potential in soil. We further identify over 11,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), >99% of which have no match in current databases, underscoring the breadth of unexplored metabolic capacity.

However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]).

Surface immunophenotyping alone is often insufficient, as interrogating functional capacity is required to determine cellular mechanisms and effectively inform diagnostic biomarker discovery, therapeutics and vaccine development. However, large panels with intracellular markers are subject to numerous challenges, including spectral overlap and background cellular autofluorescence, reducing resolving power for rare subsets or populations defined by low-abundance expression. We posited that mass cytometry may overcome such limitations; to address this, 3 small (11 or 12-plex) clone-matched antibody panels were evaluated by spectral flow and mass cytometry. Panels were comprised of surface and intracellular targets (phospho-epitopes, transcription factors or cytokines) and designed to minimize fluorescence spectral overlap. CyTOF technology offered superior signal resolution across the range of intracellular targets. Improved signal-to-noise provided better resolution of phospho-events and transcription factor expression, in particular TOX and T-bet. Most strikingly, stimulation-specific IL-10+ and IL-13+ cells were only detected by CyTOF. Superior resolution of these cytokines enabled accurate population clustering, permitting more unique immune cell signatures to be found, including Tr1 and Tc2 populations, thus providing a more comprehensive picture of the immuno-diversity present. Our findings indicate that CyTOF technology could catalyze seminal discoveries in functional immune profiling, driving therapeutic design and diagnostics.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Consequently, predicting which genes will be affected by a particular genetic perturbation remains a challenge. Here, we analyze changes in genome-wide gene expression profiles caused by single-gene perturbations in bacterial, worm, and human cells and show a simple rule that genes that intrinsically maintain the ratio of expression levels (stoichiometry) with a perturbed gene are more likely to be affected when it is deleted or inactivated. Furthermore, deleting a gene that maintains their stoichiometry with more genes tend to affect the expression levels of other genes genome-wide. Stoichiometry-conserving gene clusters can be found beyond local transcriptional regulatory units and metabolic pathways.

However, visualizing these interactions in vivo remains technically challenging. Here, we established fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy combined with Forster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) as a robust, spatially resolved technique to visualize protein interactions in living Staphylococcus aureus using fluorescent proteins. After systematically optimizing growth conditions and the analysis pipeline, we validated the method with cytosolic and membrane-anchored control proteins, achieving FRET efficiencies of up to 40%. Using FLIM-FRET, we mapped the protein interactions of the critical glycosyltransferase FtsW within the septal PG synthesizing complex. We confirmed its interaction with the cognate transpeptidase PBP1 and the regulatory protein DivIB. Notably, we found that FtsW also self-interacts, an observation corroborated by an alternative FLIM-FRET method employing Halo-Tag labelled with Janelia Fluor dyes. These findings support the hypothesis that septal PG synthesis may be carried out by a complex of multimers, capable of simultaneously synthesizing more than one glycan strand. Inhibition of PG synthesis by directly targeting PBP1 with the beta-lactam antibiotic imipenem weakened the interaction between PBP1 and FtsW, whereas the FtsW self-interaction was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, inhibition of PG synthesis by targeting the lipid II flippase, therefore depleting the FtsW-PBP1 substrate from the outer surface of the cell membrane, had little effect on these interactions. This suggests that alterations in FtsW interactions result primarily from antibiotic-induced conformational changes or from uncoupling the activities of FtsW and PBP1, resulting in the presence of uncrosslinked glycans, rather than merely from a loss of PG synthesis activity.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Metacognitive ability is often measured through modeling the relationship between confidence reports and choice behavior in tasks where performance can be objectively measured. Previous work has explored whether metacognitive ability is conserved across different types of tasks, and across different domains such as perception and memory. However, it is unclear whether approaches to the assessment of metacognitive ability that have worked in these contexts can be extended to value-based decision-making where objective accuracy cannot be evaluated. Here, we compare metacognitive ability across different tasks spanning perception and valuation, using Bayesian hierarchical estimation of the parameters of a computational process model of confidence. This model captures metacognitive ability as the uncertainty of an individuals own decision uncertainty, and can do so in the space of any decision variable, regardless of whether it indexes external features or internal, subjective states. We find that metacognitive ability can be reliably estimated in both objective and subjective decision-making tasks, and is relatively well conserved across tasks, especially within domains and similar confidence reporting paradigms.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Here, we investigated virological features of the XEC variant. Epidemic dynamics modeling suggested that spike substitutions in XEC mainly contribute to its increased viral fitness. Additionally, four licensed antivirals were effective against XEC. Although the fusogenicity of XEC spike is comparable to that of the JN.1 spike, the intrinsic pathogenicity of XEC in hamsters was significantly higher than that of JN.1. Notably, we found that the nucleocapsid R204P mutation of XEC enhanced inflammation through NF-{kappa}B activation.

This study employed high-throughput screening of 3,921 compounds to identify novel prophage inducers using model lambdoid prophage HK97. We identified multiple new inducers across diverse pharmacological classes, including dietary supplements and therapeutics. Despite the variety in compounds, all acted through SOS-dependent pathways. However, bleomycin, an antineoplastic antibiotic, demonstrated broad-spectrum and potent prophage induction exceeding standard inducers, with activity validated across multiple phages and bacterial hosts. These findings expand the repertoire of prophage inducers into commonly ingested xenobiotics, and introduce Bleomycin as a powerful, cost-effective tool for prophage research.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Research institutions typically respond to this need by providing mandatory or optional training opportunities for their staff. However, there is no established resource for group leaders to improve their lab culture with concrete action points for implementation. Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of thirty ""commitments"" which can be verifiably actioned without requiring institutional support. These commitments were collaboratively developed by thirteen group leaders in life sciences, from institutions across eight countries, instigated through the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop. The importance of each commitment has been scored by more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, from more than twenty countries. Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments. Given the high importance-scores and low-implementation rates, the SAFE Labs Handbook represents a unique, community-driven tool with significant potential to improve lab culture on a global scale.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

In this study, we co-registered MEG data and eye movements while participants read one-line sentences containing target words of either low or high lexical frequency. Using rapid invisible frequency tagging (RIFT), we simultaneously tracked attention to target and post-target words by flickering them at different frequencies. First, we provide neural evidence that attention was allocated simultaneously to both foveal target and parafoveal post-target words. Second, we found an early parafoveal lexical effect, whereby lower frequency targets demanded more attention prior to fixation, and, additionally, a foveal load effect whereby lower frequency targets reduced the amount of attention allocated to post-targets. Furthermore, flexibility in attention shifts between foveal and parafoveal processing correlated with individual reading speed. These results suggest attention is distributed across multiple words and is flexibly adjusted during reading.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

In yeast, the nucleus-vacuole junction (NVJ) expands during glucose starvation through the recruitment of stress-specific proteins, but the underlying mechanisms and physiological significance remained unclear. Here, we identify the yeast INSIG homologs Nsg1, Nsg2, along with the aspartyl protease Ypf1 as glucose starvation-specific NVJ-localized factors. Ypf1 promotes the recruitment of INSIG proteins and the HMG-CoA reductases Hmg1 and Hmg2 to the NVJ, likely in response to nuclear membrane remodeling induced by changes in very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism. We further demonstrate that this membrane remodeling destabilizes Nsg1, promoting the NVJ localization and activation of Hmg1, while stabilizing Nsg2, which counteracts Hmg1 activation. These findings reveal that Nsg1 and Nsg2, previously known as regulators of Hmg2 stability, also act as negative regulators of Hmg1. Based on these results, we propose a model in which VLCFAs modulate the physical properties of the nuclear membrane, enabling cells to sense glucose starvation and regulate sterol metabolism during glucose starvation. Overall, our study provides new insights into MCS-mediated metabolic stress responses and highlights the role of membrane properties as active regulators of lipid homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

These processes are tightly controlled, and one of the key modulators involved is the endocannabinoid system, particularly through the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1). CB1 is widely expressed in various hippocampal cell types. While it is known that CB1 participates in memory processes, its specific roles in different cell types and how these roles may differ between sexes remain unclear.

This study investigates how CB1 signaling in the hippocampus, in both, cell-type-specific and sex-dependent manner, contributes to navigation and memory. To this end, we selectively deleted CB1 receptors from neurons, CAMKII-expressing neurons, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of adult male and female mice. We then assessed its effect on a broad range of behaviors, including innate emotional responses, memory, navigation, and other hippocampus-related functions such as nesting.

Deletion of CB1 in CAMKII-expressing neurons produced a pronounced effect in males, leading to increased anxiety and impairments in both reference and spatial memory. These mice also showed altered performance in the Barnes maze, relying less on spatial strategies. By contrast, females were less affected by this specific deletion. Interestingly, only deletion of CB1 from astrocytes led to spatial memory impairments in females, which also showed reduced LTP and a decreased reliance on spatial strategies in the Barnes maze. In conclusion, our findings show that neuronal CB1 receptors are critical for the spatial navigation strategy in males, while astrocytic CB1 receptors play a key role in memory processes both in males and females.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

ObjectiveOur goal is to evaluate changes in metabolite concentration levels associated with AD to identify biomarkers that could support early and accurate diagnosis and therapeutic interventions by using targeted mass spectrometry and machine learning approaches.

MethodsSerum samples collected from a total of 107 individuals, including 55 individuals diagnosed with AD and 52 healthy controls (HC) enrolled previously to ADDIA cohort were analyzed using the Biocrates(R) 400 metabolite panel. Several machine learning models including Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost were trained to classify AD and HC. Repeated cross-validation was used to ensure performance evaluation.

ResultsWe identified 18 metabolites with nominal differences (p<0.05; AUC>0.60) between AD and HC. These included alterations in acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, triglycerides, and amino acids, suggesting disruptions in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. The best model achieved an average AUC of 0.88 on the train set and 0.73 on the test set. Classification performance was further improved by combining multiple metabolites in a single panel and adding APOE genotyping (AUC=0.902).

ConclusionsThese results highlight important metabolic signatures that could help to reduce misdiagnosis and support the development of metabolomic panels to detect AD.

Recent studies have suggested that these changes can be partially explained by altered sensory feedback processing when producing speech. Individuals with PD (IwPD) may fail to monitor sensory feedback from their own voice, impairing their ability to adjust voice and speech when sensory input differs from expectations. In this study, we investigated sensory feedback processing in PD by looking at the sensory attenuation typically observed in event-related responses (ERP) to the self-generated voice. When sensory feedback processing is intact, the P50, N100, and P200 ERP responses to the self-generated voice are more attenuated than to an externally-generated voice. Twenty-three IwPD and 23 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a voice playback study that comprised three conditions: self-generated voice (auditory-motor condition; AMC), externally-generated voice (auditory-only condition; AOC), and motor-only. The AMC and AOC conditions also included an amplitude modulation of the voice (0/+15dB). Linear mixed models assessed group differences in ERP morphology. While groups did not differ in their P50 and P200 responses, there was a significant group-condition-loudness interaction for the N100. Follow-up analyses showed that IwPD displayed much larger N100 error responses for unexpected loudness modulations as compared to HC. This observation suggests that IwPD may process voice modulations differently than HC. The hypersensitivity to loudness changes may underlie IwPD's difficulties in processing and adapting their voice acoustics.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

H3K4me2 in plants is correlated with transcriptionally repressed states, which can be accounted for by transcription-coupled active H3K4me2 demethylation, but the converse molecular pathway by which H3K4me2 represses transcription remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that H3K4me2 colocalizes with the facultatively repressive marks H2A.Z, H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub), and H3K27me3 in the gene body. Our genetic analyses reveal that H3K4me2 functions upstream but not downstream of these repressive marks. Interestingly, in genes with diurnal H3K4me2 oscillation, H3K4me2 oscillates in antiphase with transcription but in phase with H2A.Z. In addition, the genetic manipulation of H3K4me2 affects the oscillating profiles of H2A.Z, suggesting the efficient relay from H3K4me2 to H2A.Z. Notably, the diurnal oscillation of H2Aub is much weaker than that of H2A.Z despite the overall similarity in their distributions.

However, it remains unclear why these taxa are so dominant across a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics to test the hypothesis that strain-level differences exist in these taxa that are not adequately captured with standard marker gene sequencing, and that distinct strains harbor unique traits that reflect adaptations to different soil environments. We analyzed data from 331 natural soils spanning Australia to assess strain differentiation in Bradyrhizobium, a dominant soil bacterial genus of ecological importance. We developed a workflow for strain-level bacterial analyses of complex soil metagenomes, combining genomes from pre-existing databases with new genomes generated via targeted assembly from metagenomes to detect 181 Bradyrhizobium strains across the soil collection. In addition to a high degree of phylogenetic variation, we observed substantial variation in pangenome content and inferred traits, highlighting the breadth of diversity within this widespread genus. While members of the genus Bradyrhizobium were detected in > 80% of samples, most individual strains were restricted in their distributions. The overall strain-level community composition of Bradyrhizobium varied significantly across geographic space and environmental gradients, and was particularly associated with differences in temperature, soil pH, and soil nitrate and metal concentrations. Our work provides a general framework and methodology for studying the strain-level ecology of soil bacteria and highlights the ecological and pangenomic diversity within this dominant soil bacterial genus.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Although amyloidosis and aggregation of the 42-amino acid amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}42) have long been considered pathogenic triggers for AD, clinical evidence linking high levels of A{beta}42 with normal cognition challenges this hypothesis. To resolve this conundrum on the role of A{beta}42 in regulating synaptic activity, we used an adeno-associated viral vector approach that triggers extracellular accumulation of A{beta}42 and spatial memory impairment. We show that A{beta}42 leads to an early increase in excitatory and proximal inhibitory synaptic transmission onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and an increased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in these cells. A{beta}42 accumulation does not cause early cognitive deficits unless accompanied by an increased neuronal GLT-1 expression, suggesting this transporter is a critical mediator of A{beta}42 s effects.

We aimed to identify and validate parsimonious transcriptomic signatures that accurately predict fatal outcomes within 48 hours of hospitalization.

MethodsWe studied 894 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 20 US hospitals and enrolled in the prospective Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and nasal swabs collected within 48 hours of admission. Host gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing, nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by RT-qPCR, and mortality was assessed at 28 days. We first defined transcriptional signatures and biological features of fatal COVID-19, which we compared against mortality signatures from an independent cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 sepsis (n=122). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression in 70% of the COVID-19 cohort, we trained parsimonious prognostic classifiers incorporating host gene expression, age, and viral load. The performance of single and three-gene classifiers was then determined in the remaining 30% of the cohort and subsequently externally validated in an independent, contemporary COVID-19 cohort (n=137) with vaccinated patients.

ResultsFatal COVID-19 was characterized by 4189 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood, representing marked upregulation of neutrophil degranulation, erythrocyte gas exchange, and heme biosynthesis pathways, juxtaposed against downregulation of adaptive immune pathways. Only 7.6% of mortality-associated genes overlapped between COVID-19 and sepsis due to other causes. A COVID-specific three-gene peripheral blood classifier (CD83, ATP1B2, DAAM2) combined with age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94). A three-gene nasal classifier (SLC5A5, CD200R1, FCER1A), in comparison, yielded an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.83). Notably the expression of OLAH alone, a gene recently implicated in severe viral infection pathogenesis, yielded an AUC of 0.86 (0.79-0.93). Both peripheral blood classifiers demonstrated comparable performance in vaccinated patients from an independent external validation cohort (AUCs 0.74- 0.80).

ConclusionsA three-gene peripheral blood signature, as well as OLAH alone, accurately predict COVID-19 mortality early in hospitalization, including in vaccinated patients. These parsimonious blood- and nasal-based classifiers merit further study as accessible prognostic tools to guide triage, resource allocation, and early therapeutic interventions in COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

Using live cell imaging we first describe the series of sequential changes in DNA organisation that accompany cell division in Sulfolobus, which computational modelling shows likely aid genome segregation. Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembly a division ring - which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depends, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA. Taken together, these data show how regulatory checkpoints like those operating in eukaryotes aid high-fidelity division in an archaeon.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Our cryo-EM structure of the BRD4 short (BRD4-S) isoform bound to a nucleosome diacetylated on histone H4 shows how BRD4 BD1 engages both the H4 tail and nucleosomal DNA. Unexpectedly, our biochemical studies indicate that BRD4 uses basic regions outside of the bromodomains to bind nucleosomes tightly even in the absence of histone acetylation. Our results further show that histone H4 acetylation influences the conformation of the BRD4/nucleosome complex.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

We show that maximum information tree networks learned from microseconds-long molecular dynamics simulations of a PDZ domain and the entire human steroid receptor family provide mechanistically-detailed maps of information transmission within proteins in a ligand- and mutation-sensitive manner. These networks quantitatively predict functionally relevant experimental datasets spanning multiple scales, including allosteric sensitivity across a saturation mutagenesis library, calorimetric binding entropies, and phylogenetic trees.

These routes of defense evolution are not mutually exclusive and can operate simultaneously, but empirical observations suggest that at least in some bacterial and archaeal species, one or the other route dominates the defense landscape. We hypothesized that the observed dichotomy stems from different life-history tradeoffs characteristic of these organisms. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a mathematical model of a well-mixed prokaryote population under a stochastically changing viral prevalence. Optimization of the long-term population growth rate reveals two contrasting modes of defense evolution. In stable, predictable and fluctuating, unpredictable environments with a moderate viral prevalence, direct interaction with the virus and horizontal transfer of defense genes become the optimal routes of immunity acquisition, respectively. In the HGT-dominant mode, we observed a universal distribution of the fraction of microbes with different immune repertoires. Under very low virus prevalence, the cost of immunity exceeds the benefits such that the optimal state of a prokaryote is complete defense systems. By contrast, under very high virus prevalence, horizontal spread of defense systems dominates regardless of the stability of the virome. These findings might explain consistent but enigmatic patterns in the spread of antivirus defense systems among prokaryotes such as the ubiquity of adaptive immunity in hyperthermophiles contrasting their patchy distribution among mesophiles.

IMPORTANCEThe virus-host arms race is a major component of the evolutionary process in all organisms that drove the evolution of a broad variety of immune mechanisms. In the last few years, over 200 distinct antivirus defense systems have been discovered in prokaryotes. There are two major modes of immunity acquisition: innate immune systems spread through microbial populations via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) whereas adaptive-type immune systems acquire immunity via direct interaction with the virus. We developed a mathematical model to explore the short term evolution of prokaryotic immunity and show that in stable environments with predictable viral repertoires, adaptive-type immunity is the optimal defense strategy whereas in fluctuating environments with unpredictable virus composition, HGT dominates the immune landscape.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Previously, we demonstrated that nanoscale packing domains couple heterochromatin (cores) and euchromatin (outer zone) into unified reaction volumes that can generate transcriptional memory. In prior work, this framework demonstrated that RNA synthesis occurred within the ideal zone (intermediate density) portions of the domain. Naturally, this creates a question of where genes are positioned in relation to the packing domain architecture and which genetic material fills the domain core to sustain transcription. Here we propose that this could be solved by the encoded positioning of introns, intergenic segments, and exons as a projection of the functional packing layers of domains. This suggests that introns and intergenic segments are coupled to adjacent exons to generate coherent packing domain volumes. We illustrate how this organization would reconcile contradictions in epigenetic patterns, non-randomness in oncogenic mutations, and produce durable transcriptional memory. We conclude by showing that this genome geometry might have coincided with the rapid evolution of body-plan complexity, suggesting that chromatin geometry could be fundamental to metazoan evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

The vast majority of GPCR drugs bind the conserved orthosteric pocket, which can lead to non-specificity and toxicity. Precision modalities such as biased signaling and allosteric modulation could lead to GPCR therapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The rational design of precision therapies is, however, limited by the lack of high-resolution functional understanding of GPCRs. Here we present a general approach to chart high-resolution functional maps of GPCRs and apply the approach to the {beta}2 adrenergic receptor. Across ~150,000 measurements of five different phenotypes, we construct an unprecedented picture of signaling properties of this model receptor. A contiguous core activation network of residues required for signaling links the ligand binding site to the transducer binding site. Residues controlling signaling parameters connect to this core network, with determinants of signaling bias located more peripherally. Dose-response curves for nearly all possible amino acid substitutions, a total of >7,500 different proteins, reveal the relationship between expression level and potency; and the spatial distribution of potency changing residues. The multi-modal maps rationalize previous serendipitously discovered allosteric sites and prospectively annotate novel sites to target. Application of this approach across the superfamily of GPCRs will unlock deep understanding of these critical molecules and enable rational design of precision GPCR therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Using adipose gene expression and methylation, which were concurrently measured in these samples, we detected five fatty acid-associated signals that colocalized with eQTL and meQTL signals, highlighting fatty acids that are regulated by molecular processes within adipose tissue. We identified strong associations of adipose fatty acids-associated loci with type 2 diabetes, body fat percentage, and cardiovascular disease. We explored links between polygenic scores of common metabolic traits and adipose fatty acid levels, and identified associations between polygenic scores of BMI, body-fat distribution and triglycerides and several fatty acids, indicating these risk scores impact local adipose tissue content. Overall, our results identified local genetic regulation of fatty acids within adipose tissue and highlighted their links with renal and cardio-metabolic health.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

To address this, we developed a semi-automated workflow that combines low-cost liquid handling robotics, multiplexed long-read nanopore sequencing, and a supporting computational analysis tool to enable the high-throughput and detailed characterization of recombinase parts and circuits when used in a variety of contexts and organisms. Our approach overcomes the limitations of typically used fluorescence-based assays and is able to monitor temporal dynamics, observe structural changes at a nucleotide resolution, and unravel the internal workings of complex multi-state circuits. The ability to scale-up and automate genetic circuit characterization is an essential step towards more rigorous biological metrology that can support the construction of predictive models for efficiently engineering biology.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

While many efforts were made to understand their stability in annual crops, their long-term persistence in clonally propagated plants remains poorly understood. Grapevine (Vitis vinifera) provides a unique model, with cultivars vegetatively propagated for centuries. Here, we assembled the phased genomes of Cabernet Sauvignon and its parental lineages, Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon Blanc, using HiFi long-reads and a gene map tenfold denser than existing maps. Using three clones per cultivar, we quantifyied methylation with very consistent short- and long-read sequencing and ensured both varietal representativeness and assessment of clonal variability. We leveraged the parent-progeny sequence graph to highlight allele-specific methylation and conserved transcriptomic patterns for genes and small RNA. Such a format was essential to integrate multi-omics data and revealed that despite less clonal conservation than genetic polymorphisms, methylation marks were remarkably inherited. By further demonstrating the linear-reference limitations, we determined the correct representation of genetic variants by the sequence graph is crucial for the accurate allelic quantification of the methylome. These findings reveal the remarkable stability of epigenetic marks in a model propagated by asexual reproduction. Using a phased sequence graph, we introduce a scalable framework that accounts for genomic variation, accurately quantifies allele-specific methylation, and supports multi-omics integration such as our evaluation of the transcriptional impact of epigenetic inheritance. This approach has broad implications for perennial crops, where epigenetic variation could influence traits relevant to breeding, adaptation, and long-term agricultural sustainability.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Receptor switches are key to the integration of environmental signals, yet it is not well understood how their signal processing is genetically encoded. Here, to address these questions, we present a complete map of how mutations quantitatively alter the input-output function of a receptor. Using a massively parallel approach, GluePCA, we quantify more than 40,000 binding measurements and 3,500 dose-response curves for variants of the allosteric phytohormone receptor PYL1. Strikingly, >91% of missense variants tune the dose-response of the receptor. Many variants drive changes in sensitivity, basal activity, maximum response and induction steepness in a correlated manner, suggesting a shared underlying biophysical mechanism, which we identify as stability changes. Beyond this, signalling parameters can be independently tuned by mutations, with surprisingly large effects in interface-distal positions and a modular genetic architecture across the receptor's structure. A small subset of missense variants confers qualitative phenotypic innovation, producing hypersensitive and inverted response patterns. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of dose-response profile quantification at massive scale and reveal the remarkable evolutionary malleability of an allosteric switch.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

An idealised system would use a highly promiscuous bacterial host to isolate a broader range of phages and streamline optimised phage production. Anti-phage defences constrain bacterial host promiscuity, such as restriction-modification systems that recognise and cleave foreign DNA. Here, the type I restriction endonuclease, HsdR, was deleted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to make a more promiscuous phage isolation and propagation host.

The full extent of protein dysfunctions in AD and their impact on cellular physiology remains unknown. Here, we used plexDIA, an approach that parallelizes the acquisition of samples and peptides, to characterize proteomic changes in AD. Using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, we identified 281 differentially abundant proteins in AD. By systematically analyzing cellular compartment-specific shifts in protein abundance, we identified an AD-specific decrease in levels of the 20S proteasome, the catalytic core of the cells primary protein degradation pathway. This alteration was accompanied by widespread decreases in proteasome subunit stoichiometries. Many proteasome substrate proteins were negatively correlated with 20S levels and increased in AD, suggesting that reduced 20S levels leads to abnormal protein accumulation. By analyzing proteins increased in AD, we identify key properties of such proteins. Namely, they have highly specific subcellular localizations and fast degradation rates, they contain signal sequences that allow them to be targeted for proteasomal degradation, and they are targeted by quality control pathways that recognize mislocalized proteins. Furthermore, we identify coherent sets of ubiquitin system enzymes, proteins that target substrates for proteasomal degradation, whose levels robustly discriminate AD from non-AD samples. One subset exhibited consistent increases in AD, while another exhibited consistent decreases, revealing complex alterations to the ubiquitin system in AD. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased ubiquitin-proteasome system capacity and impaired clearance of short-lived and mislocalized proteins contribute substantially to proteopathic burden in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Adaptation of NVJ functions to metabolic cues is mediated by a striking remodeling of the size and the proteome of the contact site, but the extent and the molecular determinants of this plasticity are not fully understood. Using microscopy-based screens, we monitored NVJ remodeling in response to glucose availability. We identified Pex31, Nsg1, Nsg2, Shr5, and Tcb1 as NVJ residents. Glucose starvation typically results in an expansion of the NVJ size and proteome. Pex31 shows an atypical behavior, being specifically enriched at the NVJ at high glucose conditions. Loss of Pex31 uncouples NVJ remodeling from glucose availability, resulting in recruitment of glucose starvation-specific residents and NVJ expansion at glucose replete conditions. Moreover, PEX31 deletion results in alterations of sterol ester storage and a remodeling of vacuolar membranes that phenocopy glucose starvation responses. We conclude that Pex31 has a role in metabolic adaptation of the NVJ.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

High viral titres were detected in milk from infected cows, raising concerns about onwards human infections. Although pasteurisation was shown to effectively inactivate influenza viruses in milk, unpasteurised milk still poses a risk of infection, both from occupational exposure in dairies and from the consumption of raw milk. We therefore assessed how long influenza viruses could remain infectious for in milk without heat inactivation. We examined the stability of a panel of influenza viruses in milk, including a contemporary H5N1 HPAIV and a variety of other influenza A and D viruses. We incubated viruses in cows milk under laboratory conditions: at room temperature to simulate exposure in dairies and at 4{degrees}C to simulate exposure to refrigerated raw milk. Following an isolated report of H5N1 viral RNA being detected in milk from a sheep in the UK, we also carried out similar experiments with a laboratory strain of IAV in sheeps milk. Although the survival of influenza viruses in milk was variable, we consistently found that under laboratory conditions substantial viral infectivity remained over periods when people might reasonably be exposed to infected milk - for over a day at room temperature and for more than 7 days when refrigerated. Our results highlight the zoonotic risk of H5N1 HPAIV in raw milk from infected animals and reinforce the importance of taking measures to mitigate this risk.","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

Here, we report the synthesis of an acetoacetate-alkyne (Acac-alkyne) chemical probe that enables efficient metabolic labeling, robust fluorescent visualization, and mass spectrometry-based identification of Acac-modified proteins. By combining chemical proteomics with open-search strategy, we showed that Acac will induce previously uncharacterized cysteine modifications in mammalian cells.

Metabolic pathway tracing further identifies BDH1 and ECHS1 as key enzymes that generate Ccr formation.

In this study, we demonstrate that SCs from a mammalian hibernator, Syrian hamster exhibit remarkable resistance to cold-induced cell death, which is associated with intrinsically higher expression of the antioxidant enzyme GPX4, which likely contributes to the suppression of ferroptosis. RNA-seq analysis revealed widespread downregulation of myogenesis-related genes following cold exposure, which suggests suppression of the myogenic program. Consistently, SCs exposed to cold stress exhibited reduced activation and differentiation capacities upon subsequent rewarming, with an increased number of quiescent Pax7-positive/MyoD-negative cells. Muscle regeneration was markedly delayed during hibernation, accompanied by decreased SC activation and macrophage infiltration, suggesting that cold-induced suppression of SC function underlies limited regenerative capacity in hibernating hamsters. Our results provide insight into the unique physiology of mammalian hibernators: SC viability is preserved, whereas regenerative activity is selectively suppressed during hibernation.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

In this study, we analysed phenotypic and genomic data from a selectively bred population of snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) to identify genetic variants associated with key growth traits. We used a high-throughput, image-based phenotyping pipeline to extract 13 measurements rapidly and with minimal impact on the fish. These phenotypic measurements, together with manually measured weight and fork length, were analysed for correlations and principal component structure. Additionally, heritabilities were estimated for each trait. Then, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed to identify growth-associated SNPs. To trial genomic prediction, we implemented machine learning (ML) models in XGBoost trained on SNP genotypes, with relatedness-based clustering used to minimise data leakage. Results: Via GWAS, we identifying 24 SNPs significantly associated with growth traits, with several mapping to genes involved in metabolic and developmental pathways. Despite the high-dimensionality of these data, the ML approach still achieved moderate levels of predictability. The top ML growth SNPs showed some congruency with the GWAS growth SNPs, and 75 % of the GWAS SNPs were used by the ML model to predict weight. Functional annotation identified putative gene-level effects, providing insights into potential biological mechanisms underlying growth variation.

Genome sequencing revealed a large number of uncharacterized NRPS biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and their products are underexplored. The majority of NRPSs remain silent potentially attributed to factors such as the low activity of the initiation unit or insufficient precursor supply. Exchanging the starter condensation (Cs) domains within initiation unit can change the length of acyl chains of NRPs, hinting at a promising strategy through swapping of a well-studied Cs domain to activate the initiation unit and harness primary metabolites as precursors, which may offer a new option to access silent BGCs. Here, we first pinpointed two highly efficient fusion sites for initiation unit exchanges. Subsequently, they were validated by replacing the initiation region of endopyrrole pathway with a Cs-containing initiation unit for generation of a lipo-endopyrrole derivate. We promptly leveraged this strategy of changing initiation unit to target six previously silent NRPS BGCs, three BGCs were successfully activated and five novel lipopeptides were identified, demonstrating its application to recover silent BGCs. Furthermore, we extended this strategy in more BGCs from different bacteria. Utilizing a heterologous Cs-containing unit to replace the initiation region of chitinimide biosynthetic pathway led to successful incorporation of N-terminal fatty acid chains into chitinimide to create artificial lipo-chitinimides. This study provides a feasible strategy to rationally recover silent BGCs and add fatty acid chains to NRPs, enriching the genome mining and combinatorial biosynthesis approach for bacterial natural products.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

This growing volume of information underscores the urgent need for organized, searchable, and curated resources that facilitate data discovery, allow detection of broad evolutionary patterns, and support downstream analyses. Currently, no existing database compiles manually curated and validated information on published secondary gene loss events. Here, we introduce the Gene Loss Database (GLossDB), a platform designed to centralize and present this data in an easy-to-search and user-friendly format (https://geneloss.org/ ). GLossDB compiles gene loss events alongside supporting evidence, including the inferred mechanism of gene loss (exon deletion, gene deletion, loss of function mutation), the type of data used to support inactivation (genomic, transcriptomic, single/multiple individual sequence reads, synteny maps) and, when available, whether the event is shared across all lineages within a taxon. Each entry also includes a short excerpt from the original publication to provide context. This information is structured in the database to be searchable by species, gene, taxa, or by GO-terms linked to the gene in question. The initial release of GLossDB focuses on cetaceans, a lineage with numerous gene loss events linked to aquatic adaptations. This first collection comprises 1866 gene loss events identified across 57 cetacean species. In addition, the database includes 1321 gene loss events from other taxa, which were also reported in the same studies and collected simultaneously.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

The arrival of non-indigenous fish is exacerbated by the Suez Canal that allows Indo-Pacific species to enter the region from the Red Sea. While some non-indigenous species (NIS) have already changed the composition and function of native Mediterranean communities, many others continue to arrive but often go unnoticed without regular surveys or until they are strongly established. We conducted biodiversity surveys using underwater visual census (UVC), aqueous environmental DNA (eDNA) and sponge-derived eDNA (i.e., eDNA accumulated in sea sponge tissue) at two protected locations in Zakynthos, Greece. Seven NIS were detected by eDNA, but only one (dusky spinefoot, Siganus luridus) was detected with all three methods. The fish assemblages of the two locations could be distinguished based on both UVC and eDNA but not from sponge-derived eDNA data, perhaps given low filtration rates. Of the three methods, aqueous eDNA metabarcoding provided the most comprehensive species list including new NIS detected (with the red-toothed triggerfish, Odonus niger, and the houndfish, Tylosurus crocodilus, being the first and third record in the Mediterranean Sea, respectively). Our findings highlight the potential value of incorporating molecular methods into regular monitoring as early warning tools for detecting NIS in marine protected areas threatened by ocean warming.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

While mTORC1 preferentially regulates the translation of 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif-containing mRNAs that predominantly encode ribosomal proteins (RPs) via the translational repressor 4E-BP, this mTORC1 function is resistant to rapamycin inhibition. TOP mRNAs are exceptionally abundant, thus imposing a major translational burden on cells; yet how their translation is physiologically tuned and linked to longevity remain unexplored. Here we identify Lsp2, originally known as a storage protein, as an adipose effector of mTORC1 that modulates lifespan in Drosophila. Lsp2 is induced by essential amino acids (EAAs) via mTORC1. Genetic ablation of Lsp2 to blunt organismal response to protein diets drives robust lifespan extension without compromising key life-history traits such as reproduction. Translatomic profiling reveals that loss of Lsp2 selectively reduces global TOP mRNA translation in a 4E-BP-dependent manner, thereby extending lifespan via a mechanism distinct from rapamycin inhibition that fails to reduce 4E-BP phosphorylation in vivo. Finally, Lsp2 adipokine promotes 4E-BP phosphorylation and acts systemically across tissues to shape the lifespan responses to dietary protein. Collectively, our findings establish Lsp2 as a novel translational regulator of TOP genes that mechanistically couples physiological ribosomal protein synthesis with organismal longevity.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

However, variations exist across species and cell types, including architectures with fewer (e.g., 3+0, 6+0) or more than nine doublet microtubules (e.g., 9+9+0, 9+9+3), reflecting diverse structural adaptations of cilia and flagella in eukaryotes. Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, relies on its single 9+2 flagellum to navigate through environments within the mammalian host and insect vector. Central to the T. brucei flagellum's function is a canonical central apparatus (CA), composed of C1 and C2 singlet microtubules, which regulates flagellar beating and ensures efficient movement. Despite its crucial mechanoregulatory role in flagellar beating, the molecular structure and interactions governing T. brucei CA assembly and function remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) to uncover structural details of the T. brucei CA. We identified conserved and stably C1/C2-associated protein densities, including the armadillo repeat protein PF16, which serves as a structural scaffold critical for CA assembly and axonemal asymmetry. Our analysis also revealed pronounced molecular flexibility of the CA and uncovered T. brucei-specific densities, suggesting lineage-specific adaptations for parasite motility. These findings provide critical insights into the structural foundations of T. brucei motility. They also highlight potential therapeutic targets to disrupt the parasite's ability to cause disease, offering new avenues for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis.

We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

CHASERR is a broadly expressed lncRNA located immediately upstream of the promoter of the CHD2 gene. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting conserved motifs in CHASERRs last exon induce the formation of a fusion transcript joining CHASERR to CHD2. This fusion transcript is exported to the cytoplasm and translated into full-length CHD2 protein. Deleting the same motifs in mice mimics the ASO effect, increasing CHD2 protein without causing the deleterious effects associated with full CHASERR ablation. The fusion transcripts are also expressed endogenously, induced in activated neurons, and their constitutive induction affects neuronal gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Perinatal introduction of the ASO into Chd2+/- mice up-regulates CHD2 expression and alleviates behavioral phenotypes caused by CHD2 haploinsufficiency, providing a therapeutic route to CHD2 haploinsufficiency. This concept of targeting upstream genes with ASOs to induce transcript fusion can be extended to other gene pairs, and is thus a broadly relevant approach for increasing haploinsufficient gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise.

Primary producers transform this dissolved inorganic carbon into biomass that can subsequently flow into other trophic levels, or be released back into the environment through viral lysis. While there is substantial knowledge about the diversity and activity of viruses infecting photoautotrophic primary producers, little is known about viruses infecting chemoautotrophs, representing a gap in our understanding of key microbial processes driving global carbon cycles. Here, we combine metagenomics with 12/13C stable isotopic probing mesocosm experiments in a marine-derived meromictic pond to quantify lineage-specific carbon cycling activity to identify key microbial populations driving carbon cycling. We then tracked the flow of carbon from active chemoautotrophs to their viruses and found evidence supporting virus-mediated recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass through the production of viral particles. In particular, active populations of hydrogen/sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophs (Thiomicrorhabdus, Hydrogenovibrio, Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum) were targeted by viruses. Considering the widespread distribution of chemoautotrophs on Earth, we postulate that this previously overlooked component of the microbial carbon cycle is a globally relevant process that has implications for our planets carbon cycle. This work provides the foundation for revealing the role of viral lysis in chemoautotrophic primary production and builds toward biogeochemical models that incorporate viral recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass.

Summary statementThe diversity, mechanisms, and processes governing microbial primary production and the recycling of autotrophic biomass are fundamental to our planets carbon cycle. These processes have implications for carbon sequestration, ocean biogeochemistry, and the overall balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Beneath the Earths sunlit layer, primary production is driven by microbial chemoautotrophs that derive energy from the oxidation of reduced compounds, such as hydrogen and sulfur, to form the base of the food web. Growing evidence suggests that aquatic ecosystems fueled by chemoautotrophy are widely distributed on Earth, ranging from beneath ice shelves to coastal upwelling regions to oxygen minimum zones, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, groundwater, and meromictic ponds and lakes2-7. Studying microbial processes regulating chemoautotrophic primary production and the recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass is fundamental to our understanding of global carbon cycles.

While the diversity, function, and activity of viruses targeting photoautotrophs have been well-described across aquatic ecosystems8, we have little understanding of viruses involved in the recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass. Viruses are a major source of cellular mortality and carbon cycling in aquatic environments9-11. Viral lysis is estimated to transform [~]150 gigatonnes of carbon annually from biomass back into the environment, equivalent to [~]25 times that of the oceans biological carbon pump12,13. Despite recognition of the important role of viruses in aquatic habitats, there is a large gap in our understanding of the impact of viruses on globally distributed chemoautotrophs2,4,5,14-18. In this study, we show that viruses are not merely passive players but active agents recycling carbon fixed by productive chemoautotrophs, fundamentally reshaping how we view carbon and nutrient cycling in redox-active ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

However, the molecular characterization of potential mechanisms of cold ischemia injury remains incomplete. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics technology to perform full transcriptome characterization of cold ischemia injury (0-48 hours) using a murine model. We developed a computational workflow to identify spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes that accompany the injury pathophysiology in a compartment-specific manner. We identified potential metabolic reprogramming preferentially within the kidney inner medulla displaying strong oxidative phosphorylation signature in an ischemic environment. We found commonalities between the spatiotemporal transcriptomic presentation of cold ischemia and warm ischemia- reperfusion injury, including an induction of an anti-viral like immune response throughout the renal tissue. Altogether, these systems-level biological insights enabled by our full transcriptome temporal characterization unveil a molecular basis for how cold ischemia injury may negatively affect kidney outcomes.

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

However, recent findings suggest a more complex picture, with dopamine neurons responding to aversive or non-reward-related events and displaying diverse projection patterns. To investigate how dopamine release varies across the brain, we used multi-site fiber photometry to record the fluorescent dopamine sensor GRAB-DA in mice performing tasks involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. We found that while reward-related dopamine signals were broadly distributed, responses to aversive events were region-specific, enabling classification of projection targets from these dopamine dynamics. By using dimensionality reduction to examine the main axis of covariance of dopamine release across the brain, we found that reward prediction error signals are encoded by parallel manifolds, whereas aversive stimulus signals are encoded by orthogonal manifolds. Thus, our findings support a distributed, vector-valued model of dopaminergic signaling, in which anatomically and functionally distinct pathways contribute to encoding of reinforcement-related variables across the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

While early wound signaling mediated by phytohormones, electrical signals and reactive oxygen species is well-characterized, the mechanisms governing the final stages of wound healing remain poorly understood. Here, we show that wounding in Arabidopsis leaves induces localized cooling, likely due to evaporative water loss, accompanied by the activation of cold-responsive genes. The subsequent disappearance of localized cooling and deactivation of cold-responsive genes serve as a quantitative marker of wound healing. Based on these observations, we developed a workflow by leveraging computer vision and deep learning to monitor the dynamics of wound healing. We found that CBFs transcription factors relay injury-induced cooling signal to wound healing. Thus, our work advances our understanding of tissue repair and provides a tool to quantify wound healing in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Enhanced signaling between enterochromaffin (EC) cells in the gut epithelium and mucosal sensory nerve fibers likely contributes to this sex bias. Here, we identify a novel estrogen-responsive paracrine pathway in which two enteroendocrine cell types, PYY-expressing L-cells and serotonergic EC cells, communicate to increase gut sensitivity in females. We demonstrate that ER estrogen signaling upregulates the bacterial metabolite SCFA receptor Olfr78 on colonic L-cells, increasing PYY release and their sensitivity to acetate. Elevated PYY acts on neighboring EC cells via NPY1R, thereby enhancing serotonin release and gut pain. We propose that hormonal fluctuations, in conjunction with internal (stress) or environmental (diet) factors, amplify this local estrogen-responsive colonic circuit, resulting in maladaptive gut sensitivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Achieving this goal requires methods that accurately reconstruct and simulate cellular membranes across spatial and temporal scales. Although three-dimensional electron microscopy enables detailed membrane visualization, dose limitations and restricted field-of-view often result in fragmented membrane representations incompatible with simulations. To resolve this, here we introduce Helfrich Monte Carlo Flexible Fitting (HMFF), a novel approach that integrates experimental density data into membrane simulations. Together with the accompanying Mosaic software ecosystem, HMFF translates static imaging data into complete and physically regularized simulation-ready models at micrometer scales. We demonstrate the versatility of HMFF across diverse biological systems, including influenza virus particles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells, and entire eukaryotic organelles. These models enable multi-scale simulations involving millions of lipids, incorporate proteins at experimentally determined positions, and allow for quantitative morphological analysis of cellular compartments. HMFF thus establishes a foundation for data-driven whole-cell simulations.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

To monitor ethylene in plants, analytical methods, phenotypic assays, gene expression analysis, and transcriptional or translational reporters are typically employed. In the model plant Arabidopsis, two ethylene-sensitive synthetic transcriptional reporters have been described, 5xEBS:GUS and 10x2EBS-S10:GUS. These reporters harbor a different type, arrangement, and number of homotypic cis-elements in their promoters and thus may recruit the ethylene master regulator EIN3 in the context of alternative transcriptional complexes. Accordingly, the patterns of GUS activity in these transgenic lines differ and neither of them encompasses all plant tissues even in the presence of saturating levels of exogenous ethylene. Herein, we set out to develop and test a more sensitive version of the ethylene-inducible promoter that we refer to as EBSnew (abbreviated as EBSn). EBSn leverages a tandem of ten non-identical, natural copies of a novel, dual, everted, 11bp-long EIN3-binding site, 2EBS(-1). We show that in Arabidopsis, EBSn outperforms its predecessors in terms of its ethylene sensitivity, having the capacity to monitor endogenous levels of ethylene and displaying more ubiquitous expression in response to the exogenous hormone. We demonstrate that the EBSn promoter is also functional in tomato, opening new avenues to manipulating ethylene-regulated processes, such as ripening and senescence, in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

As they often have non-restorative sleep, we investigated whether the structure of their sleep is abnormal.

MethodsIn polysomnography recordings from 80 IH participants and 48 controls, we quantified hypnodensity metrics across the night (macro level), periodic and aperiodic spectral properties, infraslow fluctuations of sigma power within the night (meso level), slow waves, sleep spindles and their clustering (microstructure). Multivariate machine-learning models were used to classify IH vs. control sleep.

ResultsHypnodensity metrics were comparable between IH and controls, apart from more mixed wake/N1 sleep epochs in IH, and greater divergence between consecutive epochs of the same stage during NREM sleep in IH. Sigma power was increased in N2 sleep in IH and sleep spindles were more frequent and clustered. Slow wave density was higher in IH. Higher mean spindle cluster size correlated with higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores. Multivariate machine learning models incorporating these features achieved a balanced accuracy of 74% in distinguishing IH from controls.

DiscussionWhile spindles and slow waves are typically associated with good sleep quality, they are increased in IH patients. This could reflect greater need for sleep and increased difficulty waking up in IH, which is also characterized by more mixed wake/N1 stages.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

The process has been primarily studied in a few model strains, particularly C58, and developed into Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) for genetic manipulation. However, the diversity of wild-type strains and their context-specific regulatory responses remain poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated five wild-type strains and identified 1D1108 as superior in tumorigenesis on legumes and transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana. Under in vitro virulence induction with acetosyringone (AS), we identified 126 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in 1D1108. Although the number of DEGs was comparable to those in C58 and the legume isolate 1D1609 under the same condition, only 22 DEGs, primarily within the vir regulon, were conserved, indicating extensive divergence among these Agrobacterium strains. Leaf infiltration of N. benthamiana revealed 1,134 DEGs specifically regulated in planta for 1D1108. These included genes involved in attachment, virulence regulation, type IV pilus, succinoglycan biosynthesis, and diverse nutrient transporters, providing new evidence on expression regulation during colonization. Comparative analyses of in planta transcriptomes with C58 and Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 revealed distinct secretion systems required for pathogenesis, namely type IV for Agrobacterium and type III for Pseudomonas, and only approximately 5-19% of DEGs were conserved. These limited transcriptomic overlaps underscore the importance of studying gene expression in strains and conditions directly relevant to the biological context, rather than relying on model systems. Together, this work reveals how environmental and host-associated cues shape transcriptional responses in plant-associated bacteria.

IMPORTANCEAgrobacterium is a key tool for plant genetic engineering, yet much of our knowledge about its biology comes from a few strains studied under artificial conditions. This work combines tumor formation assays on legumes and transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana with transcriptomic analyses to explore how diverse Agrobacterium strains, particularly the high-performing wild-type strain 1D1108, respond to host and environmental cues. By comparing gene expression under in vitro and in planta conditions, we found that the bacterial response within plant tissue is more complex than previously appreciated. Cross-strain comparisons further revealed limited conservation in gene expression regulation, even under similar conditions. Comparative analysis with Pseudomonas syringae revealed the activation of distinct secretion systems for pathogenesis and differences in regulatory programs used during plant colonization. These findings underscore the importance of studying bacteria in biologically relevant contexts and highlight the limitations of relying solely on model strains to infer regulatory responses.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

The number and identity of vertebrae are ultimately determined by somitogenesis and subsequent anterior-posterior regionalisation, largely governed by hox gene expression. Interspecific variation in vertebral count and regionalisation therefore reflects evolutionary changes in somite number and homeotic identity following species divergence. While many macroevolutionary studies have examined homeotic and non-homeotic changes in the vertebral column, few have explored these dynamics in teleosts, despite their exceptional species richness. Using African cichlids as a model, we show that shifts in vertebral regionalisation can arise through modifications to anterior-posterior patterning, but that much of the observed variation is driven by changes in somite number, with homeotic effects emerging largely as a by-product of somitic changes. Moreover, low intraspecific variation in vertebral count, lacking phylogenetic structure, suggests that somitic count variation within species is strongly canalised and has remained consistent throughout the diversification of African cichlids. In addition, we find no correlation between intraspecific variation in vertebral counts and mean vertebral counts, and this variation does not consistently scale with body aspect ratio among individuals. Therefore, intraspecific variation is decoupled from both macroevolutionary patterns of vertebral count evolution and body shape diversification. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between somitogenesis and homeotic transformations in shaping vertebral diversity and underscore the value of cichlids as a model for understanding the developmental basis of axial evolution in teleosts.","NA","biorxiv",1748729343872

Our models achieved an accuracy over 90% in classifying PD patients using vocal biomarkers, with the ensemble model demonstrating the highest performance. We employed data augmentation techniques to address class imbalance and enhance generalization. Causal feature analysis revealed that the Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio (NHR), Recurrence Period Density Entropy (RPDE), and MDVP jitter parameters were among the most significant vocal biomarkers for PD detection, in order of estimated effect magnitude. Across deep learning models, features exhibiting the strongest absolute correlation with outputs consistently showed the largest estimated effect magnitudes. The few-shot learning approach showed promising results as well, even with limited training examples. This work demonstrates the use of causal feature analysis to validate the analysis of deep learning models, potentially enabling accessible and interpretable non-invasive screening tools.","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

The pathogenesis of LC is incompletely understood. In this study, we performed comprehensive cellular and transcriptional immunometabolic profiling within a cohort that included SARS-CoV-2-naive controls (NC, N=30) and individuals with prior COVID-19 ([~]4-months) who fully recovered (RC, N=38) or went on to experience Long COVID symptoms (N=58). Compared to the naive controls, those with prior COVID-19 demonstrated profound metabolic and immune alterations at the proteomic, cellular, and epigenetic level. Specifically, there was an enrichment in immature monocytes with sustained inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, elevated arachidonic acid levels, decreased tryptophan, and variation in the frequency and phenotype of peripheral T-cells. Those with LC had increased CD8 T-cell senescence and a distinct transcriptional profile within CD4 and CD8 T-cells and monocytes by single cell RNA sequencing. Our findings support a profound and persistent immunometabolic dysfunction that follows SARS-CoV-2 which may form the pathophysiologic substrate for LC. Our findings suggest that trials of therapeutics that help restore immune and metabolic homeostasis may be warranted to prevent, reduce, or resolve LC symptoms.","NA","medrxiv",1748729343872

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.
