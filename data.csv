Here, we show that the biflagellate alga Chlamy-domonas reinhardtiiswims in circles and actively switches its trajectory handedness in response to orthogonal illumination: the cell swims counterclockwise at low light intensities yet clockwise at high light intensities. This handedness switching arises from light-dependent modulation of flag-ellar beating, including changes in beat extension, phase, and--crucially--beat plane orientation. Using high-speed imaging and hydrodynamic modeling, we reveal that this beat plane reorientation is critical for Chlamydomonas to swim orthogonally to light as well as to dynamically modulate its trajectory curvature, enabling transitions between global exploration and localized searching in spatially structured light fields. Our results establish beat plane reorientation as a novel mechanism for curvature control in microswimmer navigation.","[{""name"":""Research Grants Council of Hong Kong through the General Research Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""No. 27208421;No. 17303423;""},{""name"":""Croucher Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04741mc34"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""No. 853560 EvoMotion;""},{""name"":""Springboard Award from the Academy of Medical Sciences and Global Challenges Research Fund"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SBF0031160;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

The structure of maltose-binding protein (43 kDa) was determined at 2.32 [A] resolution, clearly revealing the bound maltose and water molecules.

However, recent studies have uncovered their role in antigen surveillance and immune signalling initiation. To investigate how membrane protrusions initiate and contribute to signalling, from the first cell-cell contact to immunological synapse formation, we performed dynamic imaging experiments of endogenously tagged signalling proteins in T cells. To quantitatively capture the early dynamics of cell-cell interactions, we employed HER2-CAR-expressing T cells targeting HER2+breast cancer cells. By harnessing live-cell imaging and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy we were able to capture topological membrane changes and their correlation with mesoscale protein rearrangements over time. Our findings indicate that, prior to activation, key molecular players in T cell activation, including the kinase Lck, the phosphatase CD45 and the adaptor LAT, as well as the exogenously expressed CAR, lack any enrichment in actin-rich protrusions. However, upon initial contact of the T cell with the target cell, a dynamic and fast rearrangement of the surface receptors, phosphatases, and kinases occurs within the protrusions, ensuring a rapid and effective initiation of the immune signalling cascade. The rapid clustering of the HER2-CAR occurs preferentially within protrusions rather than flat membrane regions and is accompanied by enhanced recruitment of the kinase ZAP-70 and LAT. While the localisation of the kinase Lck remained unchanged, protrusion-cell contacts trigger a pronounced exclusion of the phosphatase CD45, an effect observed both with and without the cytosolic signalling domain of the CAR. Overall, the signalling machinery rearranged more rapidly and efficiently at contacts mediated by protrusive structures compared to non-protrusive regions. Together, our data provide a quantitative framework illustrating how signalling proteins are dynamically reorganised to facilitate CAR-mediated activation within these specialised structures.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

Caloric restriction (CR), a well-established intervention, extends longevity in diverse species primarily through inhibition of the TOR signaling pathway. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), a classic serotonergic psychedelic with emerging therapeutic applications, remains largely unexplored in the context of aging. Here, we show that LSD treatment significantly extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans and reduces age-associated lipofuscin accumulation, indicative of delayed cellular aging. LSD reproduces several CR-like phenotypes, including decreased reproductive output and increased nuclear localization of the transcription factor PHA-4/FOXA, without affecting food intake. Moreover, LSD treatment reduces lipid stores and downregulates global protein synthesis, both hallmark signatures of TOR inhibition. These findings establish LSD as a modulator of evolutionarily conserved longevity pathways and suggest that psychedelic signaling can mimic a caloric restriction-like metabolic state, paving the way for the development of novel geroprotective strategies.","[{""name"":""D’Or Institute for Research and Education"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""IDOR/Pioneer Science Initiative"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Coordenação de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a systems-level framework to explore these differences; however, their complexity poses significant challenges to direct comparison. Here, we introduce NIS, a computational approach that uses the redGEM, lumpGEM, and redGEMX algorithms to systematically reduce GEMs to interpretable modules. NIS enables direct comparison of fueling pathways, biosynthetic routes, and environmental exchange processes across organisms, while preserving key metabolic information. We demonstrate the utility of NIS by analyzing Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealing both conserved and divergent patterns in central metabolism, biomass biosynthesis, and substrate utilization. We further apply NIS to members of the core honeybee gut microbiome, uncovering distinct metabolic traits and complementarity that explain coexistence and interaction potential. Our framework offers a robust and scalable method to dissect microbial metabolic networks and supports the rational design and ecological understanding of microbial communities.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""200021_188623;180575;2013/158;""},{""name"":""École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

We show further that in the absence of ComFC, swarming is completely abrogated by a mechanism that requires FB.

Mathematical modeling has been effective to describe the dynamics of the multiple intertwined feedback loops making up circadian clocks, however it is often delicate to adapt the complexity of the model to the question addressed and to the data available. Traditionally, two main modeling approaches have been followed, using either comprehensive models recapitulating most molecular actors involved, or minimal qualitative models highlighting the core mechanisms. However, analyzing the behavior of large models may be difficult, and small models often lack predictive power, questioning their relevance. Through a systematic reduction of a more complex model, we obtain a simple three-gene clock model, featuring the activator Bmal1, the repressor Reverb and the inhibitor Cry, that accurately describes the corresponding temporal expression profiles for the mouse hepatic clock. We characterize this model by carrying out a sensitivity analysis for its limit cycle, as well as by computing phase response curves for the different possible inputs. Predictions from the model are compatible with a number of synchronizing mechanisms from the literature.

SIGNIFICANCELiving systems adapt to the day/night cycle thanks to cellular clocks, which track the time of the day and orchestrate physiological processes throughout the 24 hours. The dynamics of these clocks is complex, due to the interaction of intertwined feedback loops generating the biochemical oscillations and ensuring their synchronization. Mathematical modeling has proved useful to unravel this complexity, however there is usually a difficult choice to be made between comprehensive and minimal models, with opposite strengths and weaknesses. Here, we propose a simple activator-inhibitor-repressor model reproducing surprinsingly well experimental data from mouse livers, whose analysis casts light on the roles of the main actors of the mammalian circadian clock.","[{""name"":""Agence Nationale de la Recherche"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rbzpz17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0007;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

In mosquito-borne orthoflaviviruses such as dengue and yellow fever viruses, the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to disrupt endothelial barrier integrity by targeting tight junction proteins (TJPs), thereby facilitating viral neuroinvasion. However, comparable mechanisms in TBEV remain largely unexplored.

Here, we investigate the potential interaction of NS1 from high (Hypr)- and low (Vs)-pathogenicity TBEV strains to different blood-brain barrier (BBB) TJPs, using AlphaFold3 (AF3) multimer modelling and in vitro binding assays. We find that NS1 from the highly pathogenic strain exhibits higher predicted interactions with multiple TJPs, including two junctional adhesion molecules (JAM-A, JAM-B) and Claudin-10, which are critical component of the paracellular barrier. In contrast, low pathogenic strain Vs interaction was limited to JAM-A and Claudin-5.

Experimental validation using recombinant NS1 proteins revealed strain-specific binding profiles: Hypr NS1 displayed high-affinity, saturable direct binding to immobilized JAM-A (KD = 0.271 {micro}g/mL), whereas Vs NS1 showed negligible interaction (KD = 0.000023 {micro}g/mL). No binding to ZO-1, a barrier scaffold lacking an extracellular domain, was observed for either strain. This differential interaction may be modulated by 22 specific amino acid substitutions localized to the Wing and {beta}-ladder domains, which distinguish the highly neurovirulent Hypr strain from the avirulent Vs strain. Notably, despite its weak JAM-A interaction, the Vs strain is associated with slow-progressing infections that can culminate in chronic neurological disease, highlighting the need for further investigation into noncanonical pathways of neuroinvasion.

Here, we integrate single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) profiling, HLA immunopeptidomics and functional antigen mapping to dissect the specificity landscape of bone marrow lymphocytes (BMLs) in multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We identify a rare subset of tumor-reactive T cells that exhibit a stereotyped transcriptional state distinct from bystander and virus-specific populations. Across both malignancies, immunopeptidomic profiling uncovers a partially conserved antigen repertoire enriched for noncanonical peptides, including products of novel or unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs), pseudogenes, and clonotypic immunoglobulin sequences. Several of these epitopes are recurrently presented and associated with convergent TCR responses across individuals. Based on this immune architecture, we develop a TCR-intrinsic fitness model that infers BML tumor specificity from transcriptional cues and stratifies immunotherapy response across three independent patient cohorts.

Together, these findings map the latent potential of endogenous anti-tumor immunity in two biologically distinct diseases and provide a framework for decoding and restoring productive immune surveillance of hematological malignancies.

We present the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of a Galician population (GALOMICS [GAL]; n = 91, 17.2 million variants; https://galomica.genpob.eu/), assessing its genetic variability in comparison with WGS data from other Spanish regions and continental populations (n = 1,078). Contrary to recent claims of extreme genetic stratification, the population structure of Galicia aligns with broader Iberian patterns, with one dominant cluster homogeneously distributed and four minor, more localized clusters. Genome-wide analyses of the Spanish National DNA Bank dataset (NDNAB; n = 453) support these findings, identifying only three Galician clusters, again with one overwhelmingly predominant. Phylogenetic analyses challenge earlier interpretations that placed Galicians at the deepest Iberian genetic node; instead, Galician clusters form terminal branches, suggesting recent diversification. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicates slightly higher inbreeding compared to other European populations, primarily driven by the  Porto do Son cluster, which raises the regional average. We identified a significant North African/Middle Eastern autosomal ancestry component (13.5%-16.5%), despite its distance from historically Arab-influenced regions. Genomic analyses point to an admixture event ca. 620-670 CE that introduced North African/Middle Eastern ancestry into a largely European gene pool. The signal, likely stemming from trans-Mediterranean contacts predating the 711 CE Islamic incursion and well before the Reconquista, shows a subtle South-to-North decline, suggesting a southern entry route. Y-chromosome (21.2%) and mitochondrial DNA (1.1%) analyses indicate a male-biased influx, pointing to a predominantly paternal contribution. This observation calls for a reevaluation of the commonly held assumption that Islamic rule alone accounts for North African ancestry in Iberia. Analysis of polygenic risk scores for common diseases (including breast and ovarian cancer, Alzheimers, schizophrenia, and type 2 diabetes) reveals distinct micro-geographical patterns of disease risk in the region, stratified by genetic clusters. These insights highlight the importance of further research into implications for public health policy.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

The Genomic History Inference Strategies Tournament (GHIST) is a community-driven competition designed to evaluate methods for inferring evolutionary history from population genomic data. The inaugural GHIST competition ran from July to November 2024 and featured four demographic history inference challenges of varying complexity: a bottleneck model, a split with isolation model, a secondary contact model with demographic complexity, and an archaic admixture model. Data were provided as error-free VCF files, and participants submitted numerical parameter estimates that were scored by relative root mean squared error. Approximately 60 participants competed, using diverse approaches. Results revealed the current dominance of methods based on site frequency spectra, while highlighting the advantages of flexible model-building approaches for complex demographic histories. We discuss insights regarding the competition and outline the next iteration, which is ongoing with expanded challenge diversity. By providing standardized benchmarks and highlighting areas for improvement, GHIST represents a substantial step toward more reliable inference of evolutionary history from genomic data.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM149235;5T32GM067553;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

We find that this variant disrupts the activity of a previously unstudied antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) located between HOXA7 and HOXA9, which we have named HOTSCRAMBL. The HOTSCRAMBL variant disrupts lncRNA function and reduces human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal. Mechanistically, HOTSCRAMBL enables appropriate expression and splicing of HOXA genes in HSCs, most notably HOXA9, in an SRSF2-dependent manner. Given the critical role of HOXA gene expression in some blood cancers, we also demonstrate that HOTSCRAMBL variation or deletion compromises HOXA-dependent acute myeloid leukemias. Collectively, we show how insights from human genetic variation can uncover critical regulatory processes required for effective developmental gene expression.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01DK103794, R01HL146500, R01CA265726, R01CA292941;""},{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gates Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0456r8d26"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Edward P.

Transported nucleotide-sugars serve as donors in post-translational modification of proteins/ lipids, and donate sugar moiety to growing carbohydrate chain on nascent protein/lipid molecule, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme glycosyltransferase.
C_LIO_LIHere we reported that a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g11320 coding for NST protein causes defects in male gametophyte development including collapsed, nonviable pollen. This mutation also caused impairment in the female gametophyte progression by arresting it at the functional megaspore (FM) stage.

C_LIO_LIThe results suggest that AtNST (At3g11320) gene might be responsible for maintaining and regulating transport of nucleotide-sugars from cytoplasm to the Golgi lumen for the glycosylation of essential proteins/carbohydrates/lipids etc., which are necessary for both male and female gametophyte development stages. This study shed further light on the role of such nucleotide sugar transporters in plant reproductive development processes, at least in Arabidopsis.

The expression of DAM3 and DAM4 as well as plant morphology and physiology were analyzed during a period of semi-dormancy induction and breaking. Furthermore, DAM3 and DAM4 expression was compared between cultivars with different chill requirements. Lastly, the DAM1, DAM2, DAM3, and DAM4 expression of concurrently growing summer and winter leaves was compared at multiple stages of dormancy-breaking. DAM3 and DAM4 expression negatively correlated with leaf area and petiole length. We conclude that DAM3 and DAM4 expression patterns are consistent with that of regulators of semi-dormancy. DAM4 expression in particular correlates strongly with vegetative growth during semi-dormancy breaking. DAM3 or DAM4 expression were not found to correlate with the cultivar-specific chill requirements.

While generally thought to be a vertebrate-specific innovation, homologous placodes are proposed to exist in non-vertebrate chordates as well. In Ciona robusta, a solitary tunicate, the adult mouth (the oral siphon) is derived from one such ""cranial-like"" placode in the larva, which we term the oral siphon placode (OSP). At embryonic and larval stages, the OSP consists of a small rosette of cells that forms from the neuropore at the anteriormost extent of neural tube closure. While the morphogenesis of the OSP and its physical separation from other surface ectoderm structures have been described in detail, how this is regulated at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we show the involvement of protocadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the segregation and structural cohesiveness of the OSP. Protocadherin.e (Pcdhe.e) is expressed specifically in the OSP but not in other surface ectoderm cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Pcdh.e in these cells results in loss of OSP structural integrity and ability to physically separate from other structures derived from the same cell lineage. Overexpression of Pcdh.e throughout the anterior surface ectoderm results in similar loss of a physically separate and distinct OSP territory. Furthermore, we show that Pcdh.e expession in the OSP depends on oral placode-specific transcription factors such as Six1/2 and Pitx. Our results suggest that OSP integrity and morphogenesis require precise regulation of a homotypic cell-cell adhesion molecule, which might reflect a conserved mechanism for placode formation in chordates.","[{""name"":""National Institute of General Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04q48ey07"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM158421;""},{""name"":""Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04byxyr05"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD104825;""},{""name"":""Division of Integrative Organismal Systems"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01rvays47"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1940743;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

In this study, we develop a conditional knock-in mouse model expressing a mitochondrially targeted variant of the bacterial toxin DarT (mitoAtDarT), which induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage without affecting the nuclear genome. Ubiquitous expression of mitoAtDarT leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial mass, resulting in early embryonic lethality. Employing high-resolution microCT and molecular markers, we demonstrate that mitoAtDarT-expressing embryos fail to undergo normal gastrulation, exhibiting disrupted mesodermal patterning and a complete absence of allantois formation. Surprisingly, defects in lineage specification were evident even earlier, during preimplantation development. Blastocysts expressing mitoAtDarT exhibited reduced total cell numbers, altered trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass ratios, and a striking increase in cells co-expressing lineage markers, indicating a failure in the first cell fate decision. Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial integrity is essential not only for energy metabolism but also for the precise coordination of cell fate specification and morphogenesis. This work suggests developmental checkpoints are sensitive to mitochondrial genome damage and establishes mitoAtDarT as a powerful tool for dissecting the contributions of mitochondria to embryonic development.","[{""name"":""Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Project Identification No. RTI 4006;""},{""name"":""International Human Frontier Science Program Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02ebx7v45"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGP0038/2021-102;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

To understand how this robust coordination occurs, we use the loss of robustness mutant development related myb-like1 (drmy1), which exhibits variable sepal initiation and growth, causing failure of the sepals to close the flower bud. Specifically, drmy1 has overgrown outer (abaxial) sepals and undergrown inner (adaxial) sepals, leading to a large discrepancy in the sizes of different sepals within individual flower buds. Using single cell and spatial RNA-seq, we found changes in expression of key genes related to brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in drmy1, particularly in cell types important to young flower bud development such as epidermal cells, boundary cells, and meristematic cells. Confocal imaging of a BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) ratiometric reporter confirms that BR signaling is upregulated and more variable in young drmy1 sepals. Subsequently, we found that altering BR signaling in drmy1 by crossing with BR mutants or adding brassinolide (a potent brassinosteroid) or brassinazole (a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) can partially rescue this elongation defect by differentially altering the relative growth of the inner and outer sepals. Increasing BR signaling rescues by increasing the growth of the inner sepal but not the outer sepal, while decreasing BR signaling rescues by decreasing the growth of the outer sepal but not the inner sepal. These results suggest that brassinosteroids mediate the robust coordination of the growth rates between inner and outer sepals during early development, ensuring proper flower bud closure.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EF-2222434;DGE-2139899;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01GM134037;S10OD032251;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

In the primate embryo, the amnion rather than the trophectoderm is directly juxtaposed to the epiblast and may play this role. To model the interactions between the amnion and epiblast, we differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to amnion-like cells (AMLCs) and juxtaposed them in a controlled manner with undifferentiated hPSCs, which represent the epiblast. We found that juxtaposition between these cell types is sufficient to initiate a range of cell behaviors associated with gastrulation including organized differentiation to primitive streak and downstream mesendodermal cell fates and directed cell migration out of the primitive streak region. Performing knockout experiments specifically in either the epiblast or amnion compartment revealed intricate crosstalk that is required to properly initiate gastrulation. In particularly, using knockouts of NODAL we show that Nodal signaling in both the amnion and epiblast is required for gastrulation patterning. Finally, we show that inductive ability is a transient property acquired during amnion differentiation, and that cells that differentiate from this inductive state acquire an extraembryonic mesenchyme identity.

Many PA enzymes are regulated post-transcriptionally, making traditional transcript-based methods ineffective in determining their abundance, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to study PA homeostasis. Here, we refined a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based method to simultaneously quantify activities of two key PA synthesizing enzymes - arginine decarboxylase (ADC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) - from plant tissues using stable isotope substrates. By optimizing substrate concentrations, we increased assay sensitivity >10-fold in tomato leaf tissue. We further adapted this protocol for Nicotiana benthamiana, a model plant widely used for transient recombinant protein expression. Expression of epitope-tagged ADCs in this system revealed a direct correlation between protein abundance and enzymatic activity, demonstrating that ADC activity can infer its protein abundance in native tissues. Proof-of-principle experiments with the N. benthamiana expression system, confirm substrate specificity of tomato ADC and ODC enzymes and essential catalytic residues of tomato ADCs. Beyond enzymatic activities, our LCMS-based method also permits quantification of 11 PA network metabolite concentrations from the same LCMS sample. Visualizing this data as a heatmap pathway diagram, alongside ADC/ODC activities provides a comprehensive overview of PA metabolism in plant tissues. We also studied tomato CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutants deficient in ADC or ODC, complemented by phenotypic analysis. LC-MS analysis of an adc1/adc2 double mutant - an embryo lethal genotype in Arabidopsis - had no detectable agmatine, the product of ADCs. Additionally, despite a reduction in putrescine, no impact on the downstream PAs, spermidine and spermine, was found. The adc1/adc2 double mutant showed severe developmental abnormalities, including complete flower loss, demonstrating the indispensable role of ADCs in flower development. In summary, our optimized LC-MS approach for simultaneous quantification of ADC/ODC enzyme activity and PA-pathway metabolites, the ability to transiently express and functionally analyze recombinant ADC/ODC proteins in planta, and a collection of tomato CRISPR mutants deficient in these enzymes collectively establish a versatile new experimental toolkit to dissect PA homeostasis and PA-dependent developmental processes in plants.","[{""name"":""Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft"",""id"":""https://ror.org/018mejw64"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LA 1338/15-1;LA 1338/ 17-1;TRR356 (project number: 690 491090170, subproject B03);442641014;""},{""name"":""National Natural Science Foundation of China"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01h0zpd94"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""32372485;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid.

Psidium cattleyanum, a polyploid species with various described ploidy levels, exhibits apomixis and requires effective pollination for fruiting (pseudogamy). The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of apomixis and sexuality in P. cattleyanum among heptaploid and octoploid accessions, and to analyze the maternal and paternal contribution to endosperm formation. Flow cytometry was employed on mature seeds obtained from hand-pollinated crosses between two octoploid and two heptaploid accessions to determine the ploidy levels of embryo and endosperm. Within the 492 analyzed seeds the ploidy balance of embryo:endosperm ranged from the expected 2:5 (64.2%, pseudogamous apomixis) and 2:3 (4.7%, sexuality involving reduced gametophytes), to unexpected values, including 1:3 (0.4%),), 2:6 (2.4%), 2:7 (0.2%), 3:5 (8.8%), 2:3:5 (18.5%) and 2:4:6 (0.8%), associated with polyhaploid parthenogenesis, pseudogamous apomixis involving reduced and unreduced gametophytes, and female gametophytes with two or three polar nuclei in the central cell. The interpretations and implications of these results for apomictic polyploid species and their consequences for wild populations are discussed.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

Here, we analysed the impact of ASD mutations in CEP41 using human corticogenesis. CEP41 encodes a centrosomal protein located at the basal body and the ciliary axoneme and is mutated in ASD individuals and in Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy with high incidence of ASD. To gain insights into CEP41s role in ASD aetiology, we characterised human cortical organoids carrying the CEP41 R242H point mutations found in ASD individuals. This mutation did not interfere with CEP41s ciliary localisation but cilia were shorter and had lower levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, which is indicative of altered cilia stability and signalling. Moreover, scRNAseq analyses revealed that the expression of several transcription factors with critical roles in interneuron development was altered in mutant interneurons and their progenitors. The CEP41 mutation also caused decreased cortical progenitor proliferation and an augmented formation of upper layer cortical neurons. Taken together, these findings indicate that CEP41 controls excitatory and inhibitory neuron differentiation, alterations in which might lead to an excitation/inhibition imbalance that is widely recognized as a convergent mechanism underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.","[{""name"":""Simons Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cmst727"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""529085;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""219542/Z/19/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

Scarb1 is expressed in multiple cell types, including osteoblasts and macrophages. PC-OxPLs, present on OxLDL and apoptotic cells, adversely affect bone metabolism. Overexpression of E06 IgM - a natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPLs- increases cancellous and cortical bone at 6 months of age in both sexes and protects against age- and high fat diet- induced bone loss, by increasing bone formation. We have reported that SCARB1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for OxPLs in osteoblastic cells, and osteoblasts derived from Scarb1 knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating effects of OxLDL. Skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice produced contradictory results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass and others reporting low bone mass. To clarify if Scarb1 mediates the negative effects of PC-OxPLs in bone, we deleted it in osteoblast lineage cells using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and micro-CT analysis of cancellous and cortical bone at 6 months of age did not reveal any differences between Scarb1{Delta}OSX-l mice and their wild-type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. We then investigated whether PC-OxPLs could exert their anti-osteogenic effects via activation of SCARB1 in myeloid cells by deleting Scarb1 in LysM-Cre expressing cells. BMD measurements and micro-CT analysis at 6 months of age did not show any differences between Scarb1{Delta}LysM mice and their WT, LysM-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl controls.

Using a novel ultrabright renin cell-specific tdTomato reporter mouse, high-resolution 3D imaging, and single-cell RNA-Seq, we mapped the interactions of renin cells with growing axons during normal kidney vascular development, in response to threats to homeostasis, and a severe arterial disease caused by a defective renin enzyme. During embryonic kidney development, stromal and renin cell progenitors assemble the arterioles, express axon attractants and neurotrophins that establish the precise innervation of renin cells and arterioles in a centrifugal pattern. Hypotension and sodium depletion led to an increase in the volume and number of renin cells along the arterioles. Renin enzymatic deficiency led to hypertrophy and endocrine transformation of renal arterioles, aberrant axon sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation suggesting a feed-forward mechanism whereby renin cells and axons co-induce each other, orchestrate neurovascular development and arteriolar remodeling when renin cells are over stimulated.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""P50 DK 096373;R01 DK 116718;P50 DK 096373;R01 HL148044;""},{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Overseas Research Fellowships;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

The paradigm for appendage evolution in this phylum is that the gene regulatory network responsible for leg subdivision and patterning is broadly conserved. Recent surveys of these genes have suggested that chelicerate exemplars exhibit divergent appendage patterning dynamics, though functional data remain limited. One salient mismatch in expression occurs in homologs of the homeobox gene clawless. In insects, clawless is expressed in the distalmost leg territory, specifying the claw-bearing pretarsus. In the harvestman, Phalangium opilio, clawless occupies a broad tarsal domain early in development, localizing later to the metatarsus-tarsus boundary, suggestive of a tarsal patterning function. Here, we tested the function of harvestman clawless using RNAi. Unlike insects, we show that clawless knockdown results in disrupted tarsal growth and patterning of its proximal segmental boundary, with no effect on the claw. Truncation of the tarsus is associated with defective tarsomere formation. We additionally surveyed clawless homologs in exemplars of chelicerate diversity, which suggests that the tarsal-patterning function for clawless was likely present in the chelicerate common ancestor. These results, alongside available expression data, suggest panarthropod appendage patterning exhibits numerous cases of developmental system drift.","[{""name"":""National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/021nxhr62"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""IOS-2016141;""},{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""10.55776/PAT1457924;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"",""id"":""https://ror.org/043z4tv69"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R21AI176352;R01AI172943;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

GATA4 regulates cardiogenesis through the expression of its target genes, only some of which have been identified. We have used a gain of function model based on pluripotent embryonic ectoderm explants from Xenopus embryos expressing GATA4, to identify a set of downstream targets of GATA4 which are also regulated by Nodal, a known cardiogenic signal. GATA4 was shown to be required for the expression of target genes tbx2 and prdm1 in vivo, likely acting in a direct fashion by interacting with their regulatory regions. In addition, tbx2 and prdm1 are shown to have roles of their own in vivo, as downregulation of tbx2, a positive target, and overexpression of prdm1, a negative target, interferes with cardiac development in Xenopus embryos.

The conservation of the GATA4-TBX2-PRDM1 regulatory relationship was shown in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Loss of function of GATA4 lead to downregulation of TBX2, upregulation of PRDM1 expression and failure of cardiogenesis. GATA4-deficient cells failed to form normal cardiomyocytes, with most cells adopting alternative fates and only a small minority expressing an aberrant cardiomyocyte phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis documented severe reduction of cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell transcriptomes and upregulation of transcriptional profiles of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. Disruption of TBX2 function did not alter cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiency but led to the formation of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes characterised by defective sarcomeres and deficient calcium signalling. In addition, we show that whilst PRDM1 is not essential for formation of cardiomyocytes it is implicated in suppression of alternative cell fates.

The results presented establish a conserved regulatory relationship between GATA4 and its target genes TBX2 and PRDM1 and roles for these genes in the modulation of cardiomyocyte development, expanding the cardiac gene regulatory network and providing further insight into how cardiogenesis proceeds.","[{""name"":""British Heart Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02wdwnk04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PG/11/115/29287;FS/18/42/33827;FS/IBSRF/21/25071;""},{""name"":""Wellcome Trust"",""id"":""https://ror.org/029chgv08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""227357/Z/23/Z;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385266

Although over 190 genetic defects have been identified, effective treatments remain available for only a few. We hypothesized that integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets from individuals with various CDG could uncover common molecular signatures and highlight shared therapeutic targets.

MethodsWe compiled all publicly available RNA sequencing, proteomics and glycoproteomics datasets from patients with PMM2-CDG, ALG1-CDG, SRD5A3-CDG, NGLY1-CDDG, ALG13-CDG and PGM1-CDG, spanning different tissues, including induced cardiomyocytes, human cortical organoids, fibroblasts, and lymphoblasts. Differential expression and glycosylation analyses were performed, followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify commonly dysregulated pathways. We then applied the EMUDRA drug prediction algorithm to prioritize candidate compounds capable of reversing these shared molecular signatures.

ResultsWe identified four glycoproteins with consistent differential glycosylation across all eight glycoproteomics datasets. Six glycosylation sites and glycan structures were recurrently altered across CDG and showed partial correction with treatment. Pathway analysis revealed shared disruptions in autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and mitochondrial function. EMUDRA predicted several repurposable drug classes, including muscle relaxants, antioxidants, beta-adrenergic agonists, antibiotics, and NSAIDs, that could reverse key pathway abnormalities, particularly those involving autophagy and N-glycosylation.

Here, we demonstrated the bidirectional interconversion between CBCs and revSCs. Using lineage tracing, injury models and villus culture, we show that absorptive enterocytes can reprogram into revSCs and regenerate CBCs. These findings position fetal reversion as an entry point to spatial plasticity, establishing a regenerative hierarchy where CBCs, revSCs, and enterocytes collectively orchestrate intestinal repair. Furthermore, we identified revSCs as a highly stress-tolerant stem cell population, whose emergence is crucial for preserving the stem cell pool.

While genetics has long been considered the primary determinant of craniofacial morphology, emerging evidence suggests that prenatal and early postnatal dietary exposures also influence facial morphology. However, how maternal diet differentially affects male and female craniofacial structures remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of a maternal high-fat, high-sugar (HFHS) diet on craniofacial and dental morphology in first-(F1) and second-(F2) generation adult mice.

Materials and MethodsFemale mice were fed a HFHS diet for six weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation. F1 offspring were weaned to a standard chow diet, and a subset of female F1 offspring were bred to produce F2 offspring, also maintained on chow. Craniofacial skeletal and dental structures of adult F1 and F2 mice at 1-year of age were assessed using micro-computed tomography for linear and geometric morphometrics.

ResultsHFHS diet exposure significantly reduced midfacial and mandibular length in F1 females, and these effects persisted in F2 females. Mandibular shape differences were also observed in both generations of females. In males, skull size remained unchanged, though subtle mandibular shape changes were noted in F1 only. Tooth size was reduced in both sexes of F1 offspring but not in F2.

ConclusionMaternal HFHS diet induces sex- and jaw-specific alterations in craniofacial morphology, with skeletal changes persisting in females across generations, while dental effects did not persist beyond one generation. These findings highlight the potential for maternal dietary habits to exert lasting, intergenerational influences on offspring facial form.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

However, due to trauma, paralysis and other external factors, skin damage can occur, scars may form. Exosomes have regenerative functions and, as a cell-free therapy, show great potential for wound healing. In this study, we investigate that whether different umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (UCMSCs-Exos) can accelerate the healing of skin.

MethodsIn our study, UCMSCs were cultured from newborns and Cultured with thrombin. Exosomes were isolated from mesenchymal stem cells culture supernatant by ultracentrifugation. The impact of exosomes on Hacat cell migration was evaluated in vitro. Additionally, the wound healing capacity of exosomes was evaluated in vivo using a mouse skin injury model.

ResultsCompared to UCMSCs-Exos, T-UCMSCs-Exos significantly promoted cell proliferation and migration of cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that T-UCMSCs-Exos can accelerate wound closure and enhance collagen maturation, promoting angiogenesis in the vascularized wound area. These results indicate that T-UCMSCs-Exos have a good potential for accelerating wound healing and minimizing scar formation.

ConclusionsOur research indicate that thrombin pre-UCMSCs, the production of exosomes significantly increased. The prepared T-UCMSCs-Exo can accelerate skin wound healing during the process of skin injury repair, promote angiogenesis, and facilitate the reconstruction of epidermis and dermis as well as hair follicle regeneration. These findings demonstrate that T-UCMSCs-Exos for skin wounds are a promising cell-free therapy that can be applied in the treatment of skin injuries.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Here, we present the most comprehensive analysis of Wnt gene evolution in vertebrates to date, leveraging a large-scale comparative genomics approach of 38,886 Wnt gene sequences mined from 1,961 species. We first investigate overall patterns of gene retention, duplication, and loss, and then focus specifically on the impact of whole-genome duplications (WGDs). We uncover striking variation in Wnt gene repertoire sizes, with ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) exhibiting the largest repertoires - even after excluding taxa with recent WGDs. Notably, we identify extreme expansions in polyploid cyprinids, including an octoploid hybrid harbouring 99 Wnt genes, the highest number observed. Unexpectedly elevated Wnt copy numbers in diploid species, such as the Antarctic lanternfish (Electrona antarctica) and the brook lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri), point to lineage-specific expansions with potential adaptive significance. Evolutionary rate analyses reveal that certain Wnt clades - especially Wnt8 and Wnt16 - exhibit elevated dN/dS ratios and high birth-death rates, indicative of repeated episodes of relaxed constraint or adaptive diversification. Contrary to our expectations, there was no relationship between developmental expression timing and evolutionary rates, suggesting pleiotropic regulation and functional redundancy of Wnt genes. Altogether, our findings reveal pervasive, lineage-specific remodelling of Wnt gene repertoires, shaped by both genome duplication history and divergent evolutionary trajectories. This work provides a high-resolution framework for understanding the molecular evolution of a key developmental toolkit and highlights candidate genes for future studies of vertebrate eco-morphological diversity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Despite its pivotal role in reproductive health, the cellular states and interactions that coordinate this process are incompletely defined. Here, we establish an in vitro menstrual cycle (IVMC) protocol using human endometrial organoids that faithfully recapitulates the epithelium across the key phases of the menstrual cycle including differentiation, hormonal withdrawal, breakdown and regeneration. This IVMC protocol enables intricate study of the early phases of the cycle, which remain difficult to access in vivo. Using this system, we define transcriptional transitions in ciliated and non-ciliated epithelial cells during regeneration, revealing immediate stress-responsive states followed by wound-responsive ones that precede proliferation. We demonstrate that, in response to breakdown, organoids acquire a transcriptomic signature resembling the in vivo luminal epithelium in the menstrual and proliferative phases of the cycle. Luminal epithelial cells are crucial for this re-epithelialization and express factors such as WNT7A which we show to be required for long-term epithelial maintenance. Moreover, cell-cell communication analyses identify luminal epithelium as a signaling hub, interacting with endothelial and immune cells via pathways including CXCL8, consistent with promotion of angiogenesis and immune recruitment during the regenerative window. Taken together, our study establishes a physiologically relevant paradigm to dissect epithelial renewal and cell-cell interactions during menstruation with potential to extend towards modelling common and distressing conditions such as menstrual disorders and endometriosis.","[{""name"":""Novartis Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04f9t1x17"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

In rice, exposure of leaves to short days induces the differentiation of a branched inflorescence called panicle at the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Systemic communication from the leaves to the SAM is mediated by members of the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family, including HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a) and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1), commonly referred to as  florigens. Florigens are [~]20kDa proteins translated in leaf companion cells and loaded into the phloematic stream, through which they reach the SAM. Once in meristematic cells, they are translocated to the nucleus, where they form higher-order protein complexes that include transcription factors and drive transcriptional reprogramming of meristematic cells. The activity of Hd3a and RFT1 at the SAM is partly mediated by FLOWERING LOCUS T LIKE 1 (FTL1) encoding a florigen-like protein required to accelerate flowering and establish the branching pattern of the panicle. The photoperiodic regulatory network is largely based on protein-protein interactions (PPIs), that take place in different tissues and in response to environmental variation. Capturing the full extent of these interactions for a specific protein and in vivo is a challenging task. Here, we developed a protocol of Proximity Labeling (PL) to study the interactome of FTL1 in developing panicles. We show that FTL1 associates with, or is proximal to, several proteins implicated in vesicular trafficking, microtubule binding and transcriptional regulation. Using a transient system, we demonstrate that FTL1 can actively move between cells, similarly to Hd3a and RFT1. This study establishes a protocol to implement PL for the study of a dynamic process during rice reproductive development, identifies interactors of FTL1, and suggests novel features possibly linked to its function.","[{""name"":""University of Milan"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00wjc7c48"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PSR_Linea 3 FLORICE_My First SEED (MUR DM6 737/2021);""},{""name"":""Agritech National Research Center"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""PIANO NAZIONALE DI RIPRESA E RESILIENZA (PNRR) – MISSIONE 4 COMPONENTE 2, INVESTIMENTO 1.4 – D.D. 1032 17/06/2022, CN00000022;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Sex in haplodiploids is commonly determined by the alleles present at a complementary sex determination (CSD) locus, with heterozygosity triggering the female developmental pathway. The identity of this locus differs among taxa and is only known in a few species. Here, we map a single CSD locus to a 2 kbp region in the genome of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. It overlaps the long noncoding RNA ANTSR, which has been identified as the sex-determining gene in the invasive ant Linepithema humile. This locus is homozygous in diploid males and exhibits extremely high levels of haplotype diversity, consistent with the action of frequency-dependent selection. The elevated levels of heterozygosity in the CSD locus enable us to fine-map potentially functional genetic variation within it. We also identify elevated levels of genetic diversity in the ortholog of the CSD locus in other bee genera, suggesting that it may govern sex determination widely in bees. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that ANTSR evolved a role in sex determination at least 150 million years ago and is the ancestral sex-determination locus of bees and ants.","[{""name"":""Erik Philip-Sörensens Stiftelse"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Swedish Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03zttf063"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2022-06725;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

The developmental and metabolic aspects of trichomes have not been studied in banana (Musa acuminata). In the present study, we report that banana cultivars with AAA genome contain trichomes on inflorescence stalk.
C_LIO_LITranscriptome analysis of epidermal tissues of trichome-rich and trichome-free banana cultivars suggested that genes concerning defence response and specialized metabolism are differentially regulated. Based on the gene expression and phylogenetic analysis, two transcription factors, MaTFR (trichome and flavonol related R2R3-MYB) and MaHDZIV6 (HDZIP-IV), were identified as candidate regulators of trichome development.
C_LIO_LIBoth genes partially complemented the glabrous phenotype of trichome-related mutants of Arabidopsis. Transient overexpression and silencing in banana embryogenic cells (ECS) suggested that both MaTFR and MaHDZIV6 regulate the transcription of flavonol biosynthesis genes and modulate flavonoids content. Furthermore, MaTFR was found to directly activate the expression of MaHDZIV6.
C_LIO_LITrichome-enriched cultivars have enhanced active JA content compared to trichome-free cultivar suggesting the involvement of JA signalling in regulating trichome development. Two JAZ repressors, MaJAZ5 and MaJAZ8 interacted with MaTFR and attenuated the flavonoid biosynthesis. Our study concludes that the MYB, HDZIP-IV, and JAZ module fine-tunes the flavonoid biosynthesis and the trichome development in banana.

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms regulating gamete release in the ascidian Ciona robusta, part of the sister group of vertebrates. Ciona is a hermaphrodite, releasing sperm first from orange-pigmented organ (OPO) at the end of the spermiduct, followed by eggs from the oviduct beneath the spermiduct knob-like structure. In this study, behavioral and morphological analyses revealed that this sequential release occurs because the knob-like structure compresses the oviduct opening at the onset of gamete release. Observations of transgenic Ciona expressing Kaede under the gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) promoter showed that Gnrh2-expressing neurons and fibers accumulate in the epithelium around the spermiduct openings. In contrast, Gnrh1-expressing neurons are localized in the cerebral ganglion and project toward the ovary, suggesting distinct roles of GnRH1 and GnRH2 in reproductive regulation. RNA-seq and real-time PCR analyses revealed that Opsin2, Opsin3, beta-carotene-15,15-monooxygenase (Bco), and several ion channel genes are specifically expressed in the OPO, along with Gnrh2. In situ hybridization showed that these genes are localized in the innermost OPO layer, suggesting that the OPO functions as a photoreceptive organ. Although, Gnrh2 expression has been considered low in adult Ciona, our study revealed strong OPO-specific expression with photoreceptive genes. Collectively, these findings suggest that GnRH2 plays a central role in gamete release regulation, potentially in coordination with the photoreceptive system, while GnRH1 may regulate ovarian functions. These results indicate that C. robusta employs distinct GnRH systems in a tissue-specific manner to regulate reproduction.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""22K06327;25K09712;23K27185;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Ubiquitination is a crucial mechanism to regulate the homeostasis of RKs by impacting their protein stability and localization. It has been shown that plant U-box ubiquitin E3 ligases, PUB30 and PUB31, act as key attenuators of the ERECTA signaling pathway. However, the molecular link between ubiquitination and function of ERECTA remains unclear. Here, we reveal that perception of the peptide ligand EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR2 (EPF2) by ERECTA induces the K63-linked ubiquitination of ERECTA mediated by PUB30 and PUB31. We further identify the specific ubiquitination sites within the juxtamembrane and kinase domains of ERECTA. Importantly, the site-directed mutagenesis of these K63-linked ubiquitination sites overly inhibited stomatal development, indicating that the ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA is hyperactive. The ubiquitination-deficient ERECTA stably accumulates at the plasma membrane and fails to internalize upon EPF2 application. Our findings thus uncover a mechanism by which ligand-induced ubiquitination orchestrates receptor homeostasis and endocytosis for proper stomatal patterning and differentiation.","[{""name"":""Howard Hughes Medical Institute"",""id"":""https://ror.org/006w34k90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Torii;""},{""name"":""The University of Texas at Austin"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hj54h04"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""Johnson & Johnson Centennial Chair;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Exposure to AZ results in morphological perturbations in several species, including rats, frogs, and dogs; however, the mechanisms by which AZ has these effects is largely unexplored, and little is known about its effect on development. We have previously shown that AZ is teratogenic to sea urchin larvae, and that AZ was the only calcium-binding mineralization marker among five tested that perturbed skeletal patterning. Here, we further characterize these defects and demonstrate that embryos exposed to AZ have abnormal skeletal element rotation, branching, and bending. Immunostains and polychrome labeling reveal delayed migration of primary mesenchyme cells and initiation of biomineralization. Although gross ectodermal dorsal-ventral specification, ciliary band restriction, and neuronal specification occur normally in the majority of AZ-treated embryos, we find abnormal patterning and connectivity of the serotonergic neurons. Temporal transcriptomics comparisons confirm delayed development and implicate changes in neuron-related GO terms with AZ treatment. Particle imaging velocimetry experiments show that ciliary beating normally directs fluid flow into the larval mouth, while AZ treatment perturbs the normal pattern of vortices and redirects flow away from the mouth. These changes in fluid flow have functional consequences for larval feeding behaviors in AZ-treated embryos. Finally, we show that the effects of AZ on skeletal patterning are largely due to its inhibition of catalase and subsequent elevation of reactive oxygen species. Specifically, catalase knockdown and transient hydrogen peroxide treatment are each sufficient to phenocopy the hallmark AZ-mediated skeletal patterning defects. This study is the first to define the teratogenic consequences of AZ exposure and show how its effects on catalase activity impact development, skeletal patterning, and biomineralization.

While gene expression was uniform at the 2-cell stage, variability increased at the 4-cell stage and became pronounced by the 8-cell stage. At this stage, blastomeres showed heterogeneity in MAPK pathway genes (e.g., RAC1, MAPK14) and the trophectoderm marker CDX2. These differences were associated with blastomere size; larger blastomeres more frequently initiated cavity formation, a functional marker of trophectoderm fate.

In this study, we examined the role of larval oenocytes - hepatocyte-like cells, in a Drosophila model of cancer cachexia. We found that oenocytes in tumour-bearing larvae accumulate lipid droplets in response to tumour-secreted signals, Gbb and ImpL2. This lipid accumulation reflects systemic changes in lipid metabolism, responding to lipid metabolism manipulations in either the fat body or the muscle. Disrupting lipid synthesis (via FASN1 and DGAT1), storage (via Lsd2), or trafficking (via apolipoproteins) in these tissues significantly modulated lipid droplet accumulation in oenocytes. Moreover, oenocyte-specific knockdown of FASN1 reduced their lipid content and non-autonomously affected lipid droplet size in the fat body, suggesting cross-regulatory interactions between these tissues. Cachectic oenocytes also exhibited altered signaling profiles, characterized by reduced PI3K and elevated Wnt and Ecdysone activity. Enhancing PI3K signaling through Akt overexpression restored oenocyte size and reduced lipid levels; however, these changes did not significantly improve muscle integrity. Together, our data suggests that dynamic exchange of lipids occur between the fat body, oenocytes and the muscle during cancer cachexia. While the fat body and muscle lipid pools are key regulators of muscle integrity, oenocytes - despite their metabolic responsiveness, do not appear to play an active role in preserving muscle function during cachexia.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Among the animal models studying PGC development, the chicken PGCs are an ideal model, since it is a rare model in which long-term PGC cultivation is applicable. Although the cultural applicability of chicken PGC makes it attractive for revealing the PGC character and its developmental processes, some differences from endogenous PGCs are known, such as the remarkable up-regulation of cell proliferation and a lesser ability to reach the gonads. Understanding these differences at the molecular level is crucial. To this end, we first performed SMART-seq-based single-cell RNA sequencing to compare transcriptomes between endogenous PGCs and cultivated PGCs. Our results revealed that PGC cultivation causes a shift from a MYC-dependent to a MYCN-dependent gene regulatory network in PGCs, suggesting that this reprogramming contributes to the acquisition of proliferation ability and stem cell characteristics in cultivated PGCs. Additionally, our results suggest that the MYCN-dependent gene regulatory network increases the risk of somatic differentiation, particularly in neural fate, in cultivated PGCs. In addition, our transcriptome analysis identified new cell populations that show molecular character as intermediate cell states between germline and pluripotent cells from the early embryonic stage. Thus, our study provides fundamental molecular information to understand both the effects of PGC cultivation and the developmental process of chicken PGCs.","[{""name"":""Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00hhkn466"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""23K05777;23K17933;22H02634;JP22H04925 (PAGS);""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming ""chromatid cohesion"". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct ""leading"" and ""lagging"" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5'-3' direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest ([~]100 kb) misalignment of ""cohesive"" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.","[{""name"":""FWF Austrian Science Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/013tf3c58"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SFB F 8804-B “Meiosis”;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""101163751;101019039;Marie Curie Sk&#322;odowska Grant Agreement Nr. 847548;Marie Sk&#322;odowska-Curie Individual Fellowship Nr. 101103258;Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement Nr. 101033347;""},{""name"":""Vienna Science and Technology Fund"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01f9mc681"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""LS19-001;""},{""name"":""European Molecular Biology Organization"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04wfr2810"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ALTF 866-2022;""},{""name"":""Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00dkye506"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Austrian Academy of Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03anc3s24"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Vienna International Postdoc Program"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone. Because differentially prioritized variants are driven by Borzoi predictions, we leverage attribution techniques to characterize sequence features underlying fine mapping and generate mechanistic hypotheses for GWAS associations.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules.

However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function.

MethodsPlacental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay.

ResultsSARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression.

DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R01HD091218-04S1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

The components differ in their representational attributes and plasticity, with evidence for sparser, more decorrelated activity and faster plasticity in regions higher up in the hierarchy. How and why did the brain arrive at this organization? We explore the principles that allow such an organization to emerge by simulating a hierarchy of learning subsystems in artificial neural networks (ANNs) using a meta-learning approach. As ANNs optimized weights for a series of tasks, they concurrently meta-learned layer-wise plasticity and sparsity parameters. This approach enhanced the computational efficiency of ANNs, promoting hidden activation sparsity while benefitting task performance. Meta-learning also gave rise to a brain-like hierarchical organization, with higher layers displaying faster plasticity and a sparser, more pattern-separated neural code than lower layers. Early layers peaked early in their plasticity and stabilized, whereas higher layers continued to develop and maintained elevated plasticity over time, mirroring empirical developmental trajectories. Moreover, when trained on dual tasks imposing competing demands for item discrimination and categorization, ANNs with parallel pathways developed distinct representational and plasticity profiles, convergent with the distinct properties observed empirically across intra-hippocampal pathways. These results suggest that the macroscale organization and development of heterogeneous learning subsystems in the brain may emerge in part from optimizing biological variables that govern plasticity and sparsity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

The persistent infections thought to give rise to these variants, however, have been difficult to identify at scale. This study sought to detect and characterize persistent infection cases in California using routine epidemiologic and genomic surveillance data. We identified 69 persistent infection cases with collection dates between January 2021 and July 2023 ranging from 21 to 400 days in duration, with an average of 44 days. Significant differences were identified in age distribution, sex, hospitalizations, and deaths between persistent infection cases and all sequenced California SARS-CoV-2 cases.

Underlying health conditions were identified for the majority of cases with available medical records. The mutations found in these cases were suggestive of positive selection in the Spike receptor binding domain and convergent evolution toward immune evasion and residues observed in previous persistent infections. We describe a 400-day B.1.429 infection that demonstrates substantial intra-host evolution, and a BA.5.11 persistent infection revealing apparent competition between two intra-host viral subpopulations. By establishing a framework for detecting persistent infections, this study lays the groundwork for other public health organizations to monitor and investigate highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Author SummaryGenomic surveillance has been used to monitor the evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants throughout the pandemic. When a new variant emerges, it is often due to the accumulation of mutations during a persistent infection, i.e. in an individual who was unable to clear the virus after an infection. Using genomic and epidemiologic surveillance data, we identify 69 of these persistent infections in California and provide demographic and clinical characteristics of these infections compared to the broader population of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The identification of risk factors for persistent infections provides important insight into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, while the identification of shared mutations between these infections enhances our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may result in new variants. Ultimately, our work may help public health labs to better monitor persistent infections in the future, prior to the potential emergence and spread of novel variants into the community.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

How does the brain use such error signals for learning? While global error signals can be useful, their ability to learn complex computation at the scale observed in the brain is lacking. In comparison, more local, neuron-specific error signals enable superior performance, but their computation and propagation remain unclear. Motivated by the breakthrough of deep learning, this has inspired the  backpropagation and the brain hypothesis, i.e. that the brain implements a form of the error backpropagation algorithm.

In this work, we introduce a biologically motivated, multi-area cortical microcircuit model, implementing error backpropagation under consideration of recent physiological evidence. We model populations of cortical pyramidal cells acting as representation and error neurons, with bio-plausible local and inter-area connectivity, guided by experimental observations of connectivity of the primate visual cortex. In our model, all information transfer is biologically motivated, inference and learning occur without phases, and network dynamics demonstrably approximate those of error backpropagation.

We show the capabilities of our model on a wide range of benchmarks, and compare to other models, such as dendritic hierarchical predictive coding. In particular, our model addresses shortcomings of other theories in terms of scalability to many cortical areas. Finally, we make concrete predictions, which differentiate it from other theories, and which can be tested in experiment.","[{""name"":""Swiss National Science Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00yjd3n13"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""225643;""},{""name"":""Volkswagen Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/03bsmfz84"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Its impermeable eggshell has restricted the use of small-molecule interventions during embryogenesis. Existing genetic approaches for rendering the embryo permeable to acute small molecule treatment have increased the accessibility of early embryogenesis of pharmacological manipulation but compromise long-term viability for use in studies of later developmental processes or post-exposure physiology. Here, we describe the use of an optimized enzymatic eggshell digestion protocol coupled with a minimal, serum-free culture media that supports the survival and normal development of ex ovo embryos through larval maturation and adulthood. We show that this approach renders embryos permeable to a wide range of small molecules, enabling precise temporal manipulation of developmental processes previously inaccessible through conventional genetic or physical methods. We demonstrate the utility of this technique through the application of small molecule fluorescent dyes, the pharmacological modulation of key cytoskeletal components including microtubules and actin, as well as the minus-end-directed microtubule motor protein dynein, highlighting applications for study of cell division, morphogenesis, and neuronal cell biology, especially in later stages of embryogenesis. This approach expands the experimental toolkit available for labeling and manipulating developmental processes in C. elegans.","[{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""R35GM151199;T32GM145388;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

What do we mean by the polygenicity of a trait? We propose a principled definition that encompasses a range of polygenicity measures. We show that these measures satisfy certain mathematical properties, we argue that these properties are sensible if not necessary, and we show that, conversely, measures that satisfy these properties also satisfy our definition. We consider four specific measures in greater detail, describe how they differ and show that three of them can be estimated from GWAS summary statistics using an existing method, Fourier Mixture Regression. We estimate these measures for 36 traits in humans. We find a dearth of traits with polygenicity values that fall within the large gap between Mendelian and highly polygenic traits. We discuss the evolutionary and cellular processes underlying trait polygenicity.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witchs broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics. They also lay the groundwork for protein engineering approaches aimed at discovering or designing novel biomolecules with biotechnological potential.","[{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) EPSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/X024415/1;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) BBSRC"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""BBS/E/J/000PR9797;""},{""name"":""John Innes Centre"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""John Innes Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04kg99k11"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Gatsby Foundation"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1755209385267
