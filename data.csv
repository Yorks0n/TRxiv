Yet, they take over a year to complete, are prone to human error, and face challenges with reproducibility; limiting access to timely and reliable information. We developed otto-SR, an end-to-end agentic workflow using large language models (LLMs) to support and automate the SR workflow from initial search to analysis. We found that otto-SR outperformed traditional dual human workflows in SR screening (otto-SR: 96.7% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity; human: 81.7% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity) and data extraction (otto-SR: 93.1% accuracy; human: 79.7% accuracy). Using otto-SR, we reproduced and updated an entire issue of Cochrane reviews (n=12) in two days, representing approximately 12 work-years of traditional systematic review work. Across Cochrane reviews, otto-SR incorrectly excluded a median of 0 studies (IQR 0 to 0.25), and found a median of 2.0 (IQR 1 to 6.5) eligible studies likely missed by the original authors. Meta-analyses revealed that otto-SR generated newly statistically significant conclusions in 2 reviews and negated significance in 1 review. These findings demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously conduct and update systematic reviews with superhuman performance, laying the foundation for automated, scalable, and reliable evidence synthesis.","NA","medrxiv",1750025353183

Previous studies highlighted neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier disruption. Here, we identify distinct biomarkers and dysregulated pathways, with a focus on cardiovascular and neurovascular involvement.

MethodsWe analyzed public RNA-sequencing data (GEO: GSE251849) comparing long COVID-19 patients with brain fog, long COVID-19 patients without cognitive symptoms, convalescent patients, and healthy controls. Differential gene expression, principal component analysis, and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DESeq2, KEGG, GO, and Enrichr tools.

ResultsOur analysis revealed a distinct gene expression profile in patients with brain fog, identifying exclusive biomarkers such as NRCAM, GRIN2C, NOS2, and EDNRB. Pathway analysis revealed significant dysregulation in cardiovascular, calcium signaling, and relaxin signaling pathways, suggesting novel biological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment. These findings expand beyond neuroinflammation and highlight potential cardiovascular involvement in long COVID-related cognitive dysfunction.

ConclusionOur study reveals novel transcriptomic signatures that highlight cardiovascular and neurovascular dysregulation, providing promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research should validate these findings and investigate therapeutic interventions addressing these unique pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

The composition of epithelial cells in human pulmonary fibrosis - irrespective of disease etiology - is marked by the presence of Aberrant Basaloid cells: an abnormal cell phenotype with pro-fibrotic and senescent features, localized to the surface of fibrotic lesions. Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells ex vivo and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention. This study elucidates the phenomenon of maladaptive epithelial plasticity and regeneration in pulmonary fibrosis and re-contextualizes therapeutic strategies for epithelial dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

CRISPR-Cas systems are known to be important regulators of these host-MGE interactions, but a global understanding of CRISPR-Cas diversity, activity, and roles across Earths biomes is still lacking. Here, we use an optimized computational approach to search short-read data and collect [~]800 million CRISPR spacers across [~]450,000 public metagenomes. Comparing spacers across samples and taxa revealed a high population diversity for CRISPR loci overall, with typically only a small subset of spacers detected as prevalent and conserved within a microbial population. From this extensive CRISPR spacer dataset, we identified 1.18 billion hits between 41 million spacers and 2.5 million viruses and plasmids. Prevalent and conserved spacers were over-represented in these MGE-matching spacers, and CRISPR spacers frequently matched multiple MGEs, consistent with a positive selection pressure associated with MGE targeting. Focusing on the role of CRISPR as anti-phage defense, we observed surprising cases of viruses targeted by microbes not expected to be viable hosts. These were more frequent for viruses encoding a diversification mechanism (DGR) for their host attachment proteins, and associated with a reduced rate of escape mutations. This suggests that broad spacer targeting may derive from the recurring entry of a virus genome into a non-host microbial cell, leading to some viruses being targeted by taxonomically diverse microbes well outside of their actual host range. Taken together, this petabase-scale exploration of CRISPR arrays in nature outlines the extensive diversity of CRISPR array loci across microbiomes. It highlights several key genomic and ecological parameters driving the activity of CRISPR arrays that are likely influencing strain-level diversification and selection processes within microbial populations.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

E has proton channel activity that prevents premature rearrangement of the spike glycoprotein as virions encounter acidic compartments as they exit the cell. How infected cells respond to this pH disruption during coronavirus infection is unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 E ion channel activity triggers the proton pump V-ATPases to recruit the ATG16L1 complex during infection. This results in ATG8 molecules such as LC3B decorating perturbed compartments. This recruitment of autophagy machinery does not inhibit viral replication, rather SARS-CoV-2 exploits this response. Inhibition of the V-ATPase/ATG16L1 interaction using the Salmonella effector SopF inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication. Careful distinction between use of the autophagic machinery from canonical macroautophagy is required in order to better understand coronavirus replication and for rational targeting of any potential host-directed therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Starting from nanobodies that homodimerize in response to caffeine, we computationally designed inducible heterodimers and humanized the best-performing pairs. We used the resulting caffeine-inducible domains in engineered cytokine receptors for caffeine-inducible STAT3 signaling and in split transcription factors (caff-TFs) containing human-derived zinc-finger proteins. Heterodimerization of split transcription factors drastically enhanced their performance compared to homodimerization. We demonstrate that caff-TFs are compatible with lentiviral and retroviral delivery to Jurkat T-cells and enable inducible expression of therapeutic genes such as chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) in response to caffeine concentrations consistent with normal coffee consumption. By using the common, non-toxic molecule caffeine, and exclusively humanized protein components, these systems promise to be a safer alternative to existing systems and may be used in synthetic biology applications and for safer, more effective cell therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties. Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth. The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics. This approach will help to bridge the gap between connectomics, which emphasizes brain networks, and translational neuroscience, which often focuses on the unique roles of brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Mathematical models of spreading have been developed leading to several established methods of inferring whether information spreads via social or individual learning. Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has emerged as a leading frequentist framework for inferring and quantifying social transmission, particularly in non-human animal populations.
C_LIO_LINBDA has been extended several times to account for multiple diffusions, multiple networks, individual-level variables, and complex transmission functions. Bayesian implementations of NBDA were introduced in two prior studies. However, there is not yet a user-friendly package to implement a Bayesian NBDA, and the approach has seen limited usage by other researchers.
C_LIO_LIHere, we present a unified framework for performing Bayesian analysis of social transmission using NBDA-type models, implemented in the widely used Stan programming language. We provide a user-friendly R package ""STbayes"" (ST: social transmission) for other researchers to easily use this framework. STbayes accepts user-formatted data, but can also import data directly from the existing NBDA R package. Based on the data users provide, STbayes automatically generates multi-network, multi-diffusion models that allow for individual covariates that may influence transmission, as well as individual-level varying (random) effects.
C_LIO_LIUsing simulated data, we demonstrate that this model can accurately differentiate the relative contribution of individual and social learning in the spread of information through networked populations. We illustrate how incorporating upstream uncertainty about the relationships between individuals in the social group can improve model fit. We show that our framework can be used to infer complex transmission rules and describe a new parameterization of frequency-dependent transmission that is more numerically stable than prior parameterizations. Finally, we introduce support for dynamic transmission weights and a ""high-resolution"" data mode, which allows users to make use of fine-scale data collected by contemporary automated tracking methods. These extensions increase the set of contexts that this type of model may be used for.

Unlike traditional learning rules, BTSP learns correlations on the timescales of seconds and rapidly changes single-unit activity in only a few trials. To explore how BTSP-like learning can be integrated into network models, we propose a generalized BTSP rule (gBTSP), which we apply to unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, in both feedforward and recurrent networks. Unsupervised gBTSP mirrors classical frameworks of competitive learning, learning place field maps (in the feed-forward case), and attractive memory networks (in the recurrent case). For supervised learning, we show that plateau events can reduce task error, enabling gBTSP to solve tasks such as trajectory matching and delayed non-match-to-sample. However, we find that credit assignment via gBTSP becomes harder to achieve with increased network depth or CA3-like recurrence. This suggests that additional features may be needed to support BTSP-mediated few-shot learning of complex tasks in the hippocampus.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

The removal ratio of ammonium to nitrate was approximately 1.67:1, and the total inorganic nitrogen removal rate reached up to 290.20 mg/(L{middle dot}d). Unlike the nitrite-anammox reaction, this reaction was accompanied by an acid production process, which caused a decrease in pH. When the substrate was changed to nitrite and ammonium, the total nitrogen removal rate of only 1.1-1.3 mg/(L{middle dot}d) was achieved.

The N-terminal helix 0 of PspA (and other ESCRT-III members) has been suggested to act as a membrane anchor, the detailed mechanism, however, of how it binds to membranes and eventually triggers membrane fusion and/or fission events remains unclear. By solving a total of 15 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PspA and a truncation lacking the N-terminal helix 0 in the presence of EPL membranes, we show in molecular detail how PspA interacts with and remodels membranes: binding of the N-terminal helix 0 in the outer tubular membrane leaflet induces membrane curvature, supporting membrane tubulation by PspA. Detailed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy computations of interactions between the helix 0 and negatively charged membranes suggest a compensating mechanism between helix/membrane interactions and the energy contributions required for membrane bending. The energetic considerations are in line with the membrane structures observed in the cryo-EM images of tubulated membrane vesicles, fragmented vesicles inside tapered PspA rods, and shedded vesicles emerging at the thinner PspA rod ends.

Improving pDNA production in the most common production host (E. coli) has faced obstacles arising from the complex network of genes responsible for pDNA synthesis, with the specific enzyme(s) limiting pDNA yield remaining unidentified. To address this challenge, we employed an inducible genome-wide mutagenesis strategy, combined with fluorescent screening, to isolate E. coli NEB 5 strains with enhanced pDNA production. Following selection, we successfully isolated an E. coli strain (M3) with elevated plasmid copy numbers (PCNs) across multiple origin types. Specifically, we observed a 5.93-fold increase in PCN for the GFP reporter plasmid, a 1.93-fold increase for the gWiz DNA vaccine plasmid, and an 8.7-fold increase for the pAAV-CAGG-eGFP plasmid, all of which contain pUC origins. In addition, plasmids with p15A and pSC101 origins showed 1.44-fold and 1.68-fold increases in PCN, respectively. Whole-genome sequencing of the adapted strain M3 identified 85 mutations, including one in recG, which encodes an ATP-dependent DNA helicase. Replacement of the mutant recG with its wild-type counterpart in the mutant strain resulted in a 63% reduction in PCN, but the recG mutation alone was insufficient to increase PCN in the wild-type strain. These findings suggest that the recG mutation plays a synergistic role with other genomic mutations to drive PCN increases. Taken together, this study presents the development of a pDNA hyperaccumulating E. coli strain with promising applications in industrial and therapeutic pDNA production, while also offering important insights into key genes involved in pDNA production.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Sticks refer to high velocity single whisker bumps, while sweeps correspond to large multiwhisker displacements with extended temporal profiles.

Results: RNA-seq revealed that both NEmt genes and mitochondrial genes were downregulated in the PBMC population of SLE patients. In situ mitochondrial stress tests revealed significant reductions in oxygen consumption rate (OCR), indicating impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) across all immune subsets, while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a marker of glycolysis, remained unchanged. These findings highlight immune-cell-specific mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in SLE, without compensatory glycolytic adaptation. Conclusion: Our results position mitochondrial fitness as a novel therapeutic target in SLE. We propose leveraging high-throughput screening of mitochondria-targeted compounds, including FDA-approved agents, to enhance OXPHOS, regulate mitophagy, or mitigate oxidative stress. This precision-based approach offers a paradigm shift from conventional immunosuppression to metabolic recalibration, with the potential to restore immune homeostasis in SLE.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Siglec-liposomes offer tunable multivalency and a modular assembly, enabling presentation of different Siglecs on the same liposome. Using Siglec-liposomes, we profiled Siglec ligands on human leukocytes, revealing new insights into Siglec ligands. Moreover, Siglec-liposomes are in vivo compatible, where we demonstrated that Siglec-7-liposomes bind to the brain vasculature in a mucin-dependent manner. Given the abundance of Siglec ligands on T cells, we investigated whether Siglec-liposomes modulate T cell function and find that Siglec-7-liposomes increase T cell proliferation in a ST3Gal1-dependent and CD43-independent manner. Taken together, Siglec-liposomes are a versatile and sensitive tool for detecting Siglec ligands and immunomodulation.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Although dietary tryptophan is associated with various health benefits, excessive intake can result in adverse physiological effects. The specific tryptophan-derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis. These findings demonstrate that tryptophan toxicity in C. elegans is primarily mediated by microbial metabolism and underscore the pivotal role of host-microbiota interactions in shaping the physiological consequences of dietary amino acid intake.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Here, we report a Phosphorylation-Inducing Chimeric Small molecule (PHICS) that rewires the hyperactivity of an oncogenic kinase, BCR-ABL, to phosphorylate its active site residue. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest this phosphorylation inhibits BCR-ABL by inducing electrostatic rearrangements of its active site. This ''event-driven'' mechanism selectively induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-dependent cancer cells at substoichiometric concentrations (vs. stoichiometric concentrations of occupancy-driven drugs). Furthermore, PHICS is effective on other oncogenic ABL fusions or clinically observed resistance mutations, including to occupancy-driven drugs with the same binding site as PHICS, pointing to the orthogonality of their resistance mechanisms.

To tease apart global processing from local interactions, we applied a novel statistical approach called pCCA-FA (a combination of probabilistic canonical correlation analysis and factor analysis) to analyze trial-to-trial variability in neuronal responses. We found substantial shared variability among neurons within each population, much of which was actually shared across populations and linked to an arousal process.

However, EHR data may be prone to misclassification and unmeasured confounding, requiring systematic mitigation to ensure robust findings.

MethodsIn VEBIS-EHR, a retrospective multi-country COVID-19 VE cohort study, we examined unmeasured confounding using a negative control outcome (death not related to COVID-19) and misclassification from varying data extraction intervals. The evaluation spanned two periods (November-December 2023, January-February 2024), encompassing up to 18.7 million individuals across six EU/EEA countries. Vaccine confounding-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

ResultsaHRs against non-COVID-19 mortality ranged from 0.35 (95% CI: 0.28-0.44) to 0.70 (0.66-0.73) when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Delaying EHR data extraction modestly increased the capture of outcome and exposure events, with some variation by vaccination status. Site-level fluctuations in aHRs did not meaningfully alter the overall pooled VE, suggesting stable estimates despite misclassification related to extraction timing.

ConclusionsWe observed some evidence of unmeasured confounding when using non-COVID-19 deaths as a negative outcome, though the specificity of our negative control must be considered. This result may suggest overestimation of VE, but also the need for further analysis with more specific negative control outcomes and confounding-adjustment techniques. Addressing such confounding using richer data sources and more refined approaches remains critical to ensure accurate, timely VE estimates when using real-world EHR-based data. Extending the delay between the end of observation and data extraction modestly improves the completeness of exposure and outcome data, with limited effect on pooled VE estimates.

O_LIWhat your research question was: Whether vaccine effectiveness estimates based on EHR data are internally valid according to analyses focused on two topics of concern related to EHR-based observational research - unmeasured confounding and misclassification.
C_LIO_LIWhat you found: We observed unmeasured confounding in our estimates when using non-COVID19 deaths as negative outcome, and timing of data abstraction from source EHRs was found to have a small influence on the capture and classification of exposure and outcome.
C_LIO_LIWhy it is important: Our results reinforce earlier evidence of the healthy vaccinee phenomenon indicating possible biases in the estimates of vaccine effectiveness estimates obtained from EHR data and that there appears to be little influence of EHR extraction timing on data completeness.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract.

Using the ntRoot algorithm on whole genome sequencing data, we inferred both global and local continental-level ancestry and assessed concordance with self-identified sociocultural categories. High agreement was observed among individuals self-identifying as White (concordance rate=98.8%), Black (97.2%), East Asian (96.1%), and South Asian (89.9%), while substantial discordance was found in those self-identifying as Hispanic (concordance rate=74.6%), Middle Eastern / Central Asian (67.9%) or Indigenous (40.7%). We quantified agreement using Cohens kappa ({kappa} = -0.01 unweighted; 0.35 weighted) and assessed admixture complexity with Shannon entropy, revealing a strong relationship between discordance and ancestry heterogeneity. Principal component analysis further revealed that tightly clustered genetic profiles often corresponded with lower admixture complexity, whereas broader, overlapping distributions were observed in groups with more heterogeneous ancestry and complex sociocultural histories. These findings underscore the complex interplay between sociocultural identity and genomic data, with discordance patterns reflecting the historical and cultural complexity of human populations. By quantifying this relationship systematically with ntRoot, our approach provides a framework for moving rigid categorical labels toward more nuanced genome-derived ancestry characterization that can improve both scientific rigor and representational equity in genomics.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

In most cases, crossovers require the synaptonemal complex (SC), a conserved multi-protein structure that forms between homologous chromosomes in meiotic prophase I. Recent studies leveraging hypomorphic alleles suggest that the SC plays a more direct role in the distribution of crossover events. However, identifying additional hypomorphic mutations that avoid catastrophic phenotypes by partially disrupting the SC has been challenging. Here, to create a new hypomorphic allele of the D. melanogaster SC gene corolla, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to replace it with the coding sequence of its Drosophila mauritiana ortholog, yielding corollamau. Since the amino acid sequence of SC proteins is rapidly diverging while maintaining the general tripartite structure of the SC, we hypothesized that this replacement would enable the assembly of the SC but show defects in crossover distribution. Indeed, at 25 {degrees}C corollamau homozygous females exhibited full-length SC with defects in SC maintenance and crossover formation, resulting in moderate levels of chromosome missegregation. At 18 {degrees}C, SC maintenance was rescued, and recombination rates were improved, although they remained significantly lower than observed in wild type. Importantly, these phenotypes are less severe than observed in corolla null mutant flies, suggesting corollamau is a hypomorphic allele. Unexpectedly, in homozygotes we also observed unique polycomplexes composed of the SC proteins Corolla and Corona but lacking the transverse filament protein C(3)G. Overall, we report a novel hypomorphic allele of corolla that will enable future studies on the role of the SC in crossover distribution. Further, the unique polycomplexes found in mutant flies may provide new insights into SC protein-protein interactions and SC architecture.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

As a result, TD can discriminate between essential and non-essential genes with the competitive performances of one of SOTA, JACKS, which previously outperformed various SOTA. In addition to this, in spite of that TD is nothing but the simple linear algebra, TD can achieve the performance even without control samples without which JACKS even cannot be performed.

It is mediated by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and DNMT3B, in cooperation with catalytically inactive DNMT3L. Abnormal DNA methylation contributes to genomic instability and oncogenesis, yet the mechanisms governing its establishment and regulation remain unclear. Here, we present high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the nucleosome-bound full-length DNMT3A2-3L and its oligomeric assemblies in the nucleosome-free state. Strikingly, DNMT3L C-terminal ''Switching Helix'' displayed a distinct conformation with a 180{degrees} rotational difference compared to its DNMT3B3 counterpart in the presence of nucleosome, preventing direct interactions with the nucleosome acidic patch. Instead, DNMT3L ADD domain promotes nucleosome binding, while DNMT3A PWWP domain inhibits it, indicating multi-layer regulation. Additionally, the novel oligomeric arrangement of DNMT3A2-3L in nucleosome-free states highlights its dynamic assembly and potential allosteric regulation. Furthermore, we identified the critical role of DNMT3L as a sensor of histone modifications, guiding the complex's chromatin interaction. These findings uncover a previously unknown mechanism by which DNMT3A-3L mediates de novo DNA methylation on chromatin through complex reorganization, histone tail sensing, dynamic DNA search, and nucleosome engagement, providing key insights into epigenetic regulation.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Patients with SSD have been hypothesized to exhibit an accelerated decline in age-related cortical folding, quantified with the Local Gyrification Index (LGI). Here, we assessed longitudinal and cross-sectional LGI differences in patients with chronic SSD relative to healthy controls across 13 years.

Study DesignThe sample comprised patients with SSD (mean baseline age=41.28 years) and healthy controls (mean baseline age=41.56 years) with MRI acquisitions at baseline (103 SSD; 99 controls) and follow-up after 5 (50 SSD; 57 controls) and 13 years (42 SSD; 60 controls). T1-weighted images were processed with the longitudinal pipeline in FreeSurfer. Spatio-temporal linear mixed-effects models were used to test for longitudinal and cross-sectional case-control differences in LGI, as well as the impact of symptom severity and antipsychotic medication dose among patients.

Study ResultsAlthough cross-sectional LGI was lower in patients in extensive frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, we observed no significant differences in longitudinal trajectories between patients and controls after FDR correction. Medication dose was linked cross-sectionally to lower LGI of the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex, and the postcentral gyrus.

ConclusionIn the longest longitudinal study on cortical folding in SSD to date, we found no accelerated progressive decline in cortical folding in patients. Thus, chronic SSD appears to be characterized by a state of stable hypogyria relative to healthy controls, supporting the interpretation of LGI as a marker of neurodevelopmental or early-life disturbances in SSD.","NA","medrxiv",1750025353183

Traditionally, mtDNA deletions have been studied using bulk DNA sequencing, but bulk methods average signals across cells, thereby masking the cell-type-specific mutational landscapes. Resolving mtDNA deletions at single-cell resolution is beneficial for understanding how these mutations affect distinct cell populations. To date, no specialized method exists for detecting cell-type-specific mtDNA deletions from single-cell RNA sequencing data. Notably, mtDNA possesses unique molecular features: a high copy number, stable transcription, and compact structure of the mitochondrial genome. This results in a relatively high abundance of mtDNA-derived reads even in single-cell RNA sequencing data, suggesting the possibility of detecting mtDNA deletion variants directly from transcriptomic data. Results Here, we present MitoDelta, a computational pipeline that enables the detection of mtDNA deletions at cell-type resolution solely from single-cell RNA sequencing data. MitoDelta combines a sensitive alignment strategy with robust statistical filtering based on a beta-binomial model, allowing accurate identification of deletion events even from noisy single-cell transcriptomes. To capture cell-type-specific deletion patterns, MitoDelta analyzes reads pooled by annotated cell types, enabling quantification of deletion burden across distinct cellular populations. We benchmarked MitoDelta against existing mtDNA deletion detection tools and demonstrated superior overall performance. As a practical application, we applied MitoDelta to a published single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset for Parkinson's disease and revealed distinct mtDNA deletion burdens across neuronal subtypes. Conclusions MitoDelta enables the transcriptome-integrated, cell-type-specific detection of mtDNA deletions from single-cell RNA sequencing data alone, offering a valuable framework for reanalyzing public datasets and studying mitochondrial genome alterations at cell-type resolution. This integrated approach enables insights into how mtDNA deletions are distributed across specific cell types and cellular states, providing new opportunities to investigate the role of mtDNA deletions in cell-type-specific disease mechanisms.

Here, we show that nighttime caffeine intake impairs inhibitory control in Drosophila melanogaster, resulting in impulsive motor behavior, with females more sensitive than males. This effect is independent of hyperactivity or sleep loss, as walking speed was unchanged, and artificial sleep deprivation via light or mechanical stimulation did not elicit similar deficits. Notably, daytime caffeine feeding did not impair inhibitory control, highlighting a circadian gating of caffeines behavioral impact. Mechanistically, we identify dopamine signaling as a key mediator of caffeine-induced impulsivity. Reduced dopamine synthesis (pale/+), silencing of PAM dopaminergic neurons, or altered dopamine transporter activity (fumin/+) attenuated or exacerbated caffeine-induced impulsivity. Targeted manipulations identified the dopamine D1 receptor (dDA1/Dop1R1) in the mushroom body (MB) alpha/beta and gamma lobes as essential for this effect, with gamma-lobe neurons exhibiting heightened sensitivity. These findings reveal a circadian- and dopamine-dependent mechanism through which nighttime caffeine impairs behavioral inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) play a role in memory consolidation and are impaired in various AD mouse models. However, it remains unclear how experience affects SWRs and how extrinsic signals contribute to SWR generation in AD. Here, by combining behavioral, in vivo electrophysiological and fiber photometry approaches, we show that an experience-dependent increase in hippocampal SWRs is disrupted in male and female 5xFAD mice. In wild-type mice, SWRs during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) increased after exploring a novel environment and the SWR rate gradually decreased with NREMS episodes and multiple behavioral sessions. However, 5xFAD mice did not show such experience-dependent SWR rate changes. A similar deficit was observed after a novel object recognition test. On the other hand, sleep spindles were intact in 5xFAD mice under all conditions. Since deficits in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons have been implicated in 5xFAD mice and SWRs are regulated by hippocampal cholinergic tone, we examined if hippocampal cholinergic signals could explain experience-dependent SWR deficits. Using fiber photometry and expressing a genetically encoded acetylcholine (ACh) sensor in the hippocampus, we found that ACh dynamics in the hippocampus were intact in 5xFAD mice across sleep-wake cycles, including NREMS, while we also found a negative correlation of infraslow cortical signal power dynamics with hippocampal ACh signals during NREMS regardless of genotypes. These results suggest that experience-dependent SWR deficits stem from non-cholinergic pathological changes.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

LD dysmetabolism has been considered a pathological hallmark in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). In this study, we investigated the alterations in LD metabolism and their impact on mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM) in an in vitro model of AD, namely the mouse neuroblastoma cell (N2A) line overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein with the familial Swedish mutation (APPswe). In APPswe cells, we found depletion of LD associated with an accumulation of free fatty acids that can be related with the observed LD degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy. In these cells we also found decreased levels of seipin, which might contribute to triacylglycerol accumulation. These lipid alterations are associated with increased levels of ROS and lipid peroxidation in APPswe cells. The pharmacological modulation of DGAT1, that mediates triacylglycerol synthesis, normalized LD size and improved ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial function in APPswe cells. In summary, these observations suggest the involvement of altered LD metabolism in AD pathophysiology, which impact on MAM and mitochondria function leading to cell dyshomeostasis. Our findings also support the idea that LD are relevant therapeutic targets in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

SCTr enabled a detailed analysis of adaptive stress response pathways (SRPs), including the unfolded protein response (UPR), oxidative stress response (OSR), heat shock response (HSR), and DNA damage response (DDR). Troglitazone upregulated lipid metabolism genes (PLIN2, ACOX1) along with HSR and UPR activation, with co-expression of DNAJA1, HSP90AA1, and DDIT3 in subsets of cells. Brefeldin A and tunicamycin strongly induced UPR markers (HSPA5, SYVN1, LMF2, PDIA4) in subsets of cells, with some also expressing apoptotic (DDIT3, CASP8) and autophagic (SQSTM1) genes, indicating diverse stress responses. Rotenone activated GDF15, TRIB3, and DDIT3 in a fraction of cells, accompanied by PLIN2 and mild UPR induction, reflecting heterogeneous mitochondrial stress responses. We scored individual cells using literature-derived SRP gene signatures to characterize overall stress phenotypes and clustered them using a generalized Jaccard metric. The clustering revealed five phenotypic groups spanning cell states associated with homeostasis, adaptive responses, terminal outcomes, autophagy, and apoptosis. By systematically analyzing the distributions of cells in different states across treatments, we visualized dynamic shifts in cellular subpopulations responding to chemicals, revealing early stress responses and potential transitions to cell death. Our findings suggest the utility of SCTr in decoding stress states that could provide possible insights into transitions between cellular adaptive and terminal transitions involved in toxicity.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

It is transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes belonging to the Culicidae family and affects both humans and non-human primates (NHPs).

This study aimed to investigate the sylvatic Culicidae fauna and the occurrence of natural YFV infection in a microregion of southern Santa Catarina, Brazil, an area recently affected by a sylvatic YF outbreak. Entomological collections were carried out between January and February 2023 in five municipalities with confirmed viral circulation.

Natural YFV infection was assessed using RT-LAMP. A total of 4,352 female culicids were collected, representing at least 32 species, including several key sylvatic YFV vectors. Haemagogus leucocelaenus was identified in all sampled municipalities, whereas Haemagogus janthinomys, the primary vector of sylvatic YFV in Brazil, was not detected.

Mosquitoes from the genera Aedes, Haemagogus, Psorophora, and Sabethes were tested for YFV. Only one pool, composed of Sabethes albiprivus, tested positive, yielding a minimum infection rate (MIR) of 11.6. This is the first record of natural YFV infection in Sa. albiprivus in southern Brazil, and only the third reported case globally, highlighting its potential role as a secondary vector in maintaining viral circulation in sylvatic environments.

Based on species presence and abundance, Hg. leucocelaenus is likely to have acted as the primary YFV vector in the study area. The composition of the culicid fauna, coupled with the detection of YFV in sylvatic vectors, indicates an ongoing epidemiological risk. These findings underscore the need to strengthen entomological surveillance and expand YF vaccination coverage in affected and neighbouring regions.

Author SummaryThis study investigated sylvatic mosquito populations in a region of southern Santa Catarina, Brazil, recently affected by a yellow fever outbreak. Yellow fever is a serious mosquito-borne disease that can affect both humans and non-human primates. Nearly 4,400 mosquitoes from various species were collected, and, for the first time in southern Brazil, natural infection with yellow fever virus (YFV) was detected in Sabethes albiprivus. This finding suggests that Sa. albiprivus may play a previously unrecognized role in maintaining YFV in the environment.

The known vector Haemagogus leucocelaenus was found in all sampled locations, indicating it may have been the primary vector responsible for virus transmission in the region. These results enhance our understanding of YFVs natural transmission cycles and provide new insights into how the virus persists in sylvatic environments.

This research contributes to the fields of biology, ecology, and public health by reinforcing the importance of ongoing entomological surveillance and preventive vaccination, both of which are essential for preventing future outbreaks and protecting vulnerable populations.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

This diversity is often referred to as intratumoral heterogeneity and is known to complicate the interpretation of single-test biomarkers. Microsatellite instability (MSI) is one such biomarker, which is used to help guide immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment through the classification of samples as either having high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or as being microsatellite stable (MSS). One area that has yet to be addressed in depth is whether MSI itself is a heterogeneous phenomenon, such that only some subclones are MSI-H. To investigate heterogeneity in MSI status, we curated and analyzed data from several single-cell RNA sequencing studies that had paired clinical MSI status and developed a computational pipeline to infer MSI-H cells and quantify heterogeneity In MSI status. We found evidence of heterogeneity in MSI status both in individuals originally classified as MSI-H and MSS. Out of 49 individuals, 15 showed evidence of divergence in MSI status between distinct clusters of cancer cells and most had distinct MSI-H and MSS subclones. These results raise questions about the current practice of treating MSI as a binary biomarker, ignoring heterogeneity between cancer subclones. Accounting for heterogeneity may lead to improved biomarker performance and, potentially, help explain reports of intrinsic treatment resistance and low overall responder rate in MSI-H cancers. Further studies are warranted to determine the frequency of heterogeneity in this biomarker at the population level, and whether the presence of both MSI-H and MSS subclones can have clinical implications.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Notably, flies developed a strong preference for immobile over mobile objects, despite their near identical appearance, suggesting they learn about object stability through physical interaction. This preference was impaired by silencing specific h{Delta} neurons in the fan-shaped body, a circuit known for spatial navigation through vector computations. h{Delta} neurons also modulated object interaction motifs and fidelity of following visual guidance cues, pointing to a role in balancing goal-directed and exploratory behaviors.

The molecular basis of this cognitive resilience remains poorly understood due to a lack of mechanistic models. Here, we integrate systems level Boolean network modeling with in vivo validation to define the transcriptomic logic of AsymAD and uncover a novel preclinical model. Using Boolean implication networks trained on large-scale human cortical RNA seq datasets, we identified a robust and invariant AD gene signature that accurately stratifies disease states across independent datasets. Application of this signature to Chromogranin A deficient PS19 mice (CgA-KO/PS19) revealed a unique resilience phenotype: male mice developed AD like molecular and neuropathological profiles in the pre-frontal cortex yet retained intact learning and memory. Female CgA-KO/PS19 mice displayed even greater protection, including reduced Tau phosphorylation and preserved synaptic ultrastructure. These findings establish the first validated murine model of AsymAD and identify CgA as a modifiable node linking neuroendocrine signaling, Tauopathy, and cognitive preservation.

These sensory processing differences suggest the potential for using patterned auditory stimulation to modulate neural activity and mitigate symptoms. While impairments in higher cognitive functions are a hallmark of autism, they remain underexplored in rodent models compared to basic sensory-motor deficits. In this study, we investigated higher cognitive function in the valproic acid (VPA) rodent model of autism and evaluated whether auditory entrainment could ameliorate associated impairments. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of VPA on embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), and offspring were subsequently tested on a delayed non-match to place (DNMP) task to assess working memory. Following 40Hz sensory entrainment, VPA-exposed animals showed significantly impaired performance and altered trial-by-trial learning dynamics, indicating deficits in working memory-based decision making. More importantly, auditory stimulation led to increased gamma-frequency oscillations and enhanced power in other bands (theta, beta) across brain regions, as assessed by LFP recordings in freely moving animals. These neural effects were sustained even after stimulation ended, indicating robust and lasting modulation of brain dynamics.

To address this challenge, we developed ARTIC HELP (Homebrew Enzymes for Library Preparation), a practical, open-source adaptation of the widely adopted ARTIC nanopore sequencing protocol for viral genomic surveillance. We describe generic, cost-effective alternatives to all enzyme mixes used in tiling multiplex RT-PCR amplification of the virus genome, and the nanopore native barcoding workflow, including end-prep (EP), barcode ligation (BL), and adapter ligation (AL), making it broadly applicable to any laboratory. Through systematic evaluation, we identified a wild-type M-MLV reverse transcriptase and two types of proofreading DNA polymerases as effective alternatives when standard reagents are unavailable due to high cost or limited supply: B-family Pfu-based polymerases with a fused Sso7d DNA-binding domain, and blends combining A-family (Taq-based) and B-family (Pfu-based) polymerases. Validation on clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and Norovirus GII confirmed that the HELP workflow achieves genome coverage comparable to the ARTIC LoCost protocol. For SARS-CoV-2 samples (Ct [&le;]28), the wild-type M-MLV RT combined with selected Pfu or A+B polymerases, along with optimised HELP mixes (EP, BL, AL), achieved genome coverage of 84.0-99.6%. For Norovirus GII (Ct [&le;]32), the HELP workflow using one of the Pfu polymerases achieved genome coverage of >85% for six out of eight genotypes tested. Notably, several of the other polymerases tested showed reduced performance at higher Ct values. However, they still achieved strong coverage at Ct <24, supporting their use as emergency alternatives in rapid outbreak-response sequencing when viral input is high and RNA quality is sufficient. Our approach, ARTIC HELP, provides a framework which can be implemented to address supply chain disruptions, while maintaining robust genomic sequencing capabilities. A cost analysis highlights the well-known significant global disparities in reagent pricing, driven not by protocol differences but by import fees and supply barriers. Thus, our findings highlight the need for fairer global pricing models and support for local sourcing strategies like HELP, to promote equity in genomic research and ensure preparedness for future public health challenges.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

In such cases, we understand the information by selectively attending to one of the modalities. Previous research has shown that selective attention to a specific stimulus modality modulates cortical activity patterns. However, it remains unclear which aspects of linguistic information are selectively modulated by attention and how such modulation influences the decodability of semantic content. To address this question, we constructed decoding models of latent semantic features from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data of six participants in both unimodal (either visual or auditory) and bimodal conditions (simultaneously visual and auditory, with participants attending to a single modality at a time). In unimodal conditions, we successfully decoded the semantic contents from the brain activity. Decodable features were consistent across modalities in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. For bimodal conditions, decoding accuracies for the attended stimuli were higher than for the ignored when training and test stimuli belonged to the same modality. Furthermore, decodable features were more consistent across modalities with attended than ignored stimuli in both intra-modal and cross-modal decoding. These results indicate common decodable semantic features regardless of the presentation modality and that selective attention enhances the semantic representations contributing to such decodability.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Studies of neural circuit evolution often focus on a few elements within a network. However, addressing fundamental questions in evolutionary neuroscience, such as whether some elements are more evolvable than others, requires a more global and unbiased approach. Here, we used synapse-level comparative connectomics to examine how an entire olfactory circuit evolves. We compared the full antennal lobe connectome of the larvae of two closely related Drosophila species, D. melanogaster and D. erecta, which differ in their ecological niches and odour-driven behaviours. We found that evolutionary change is unevenly distributed across the network. Some features, including neuron types, neuron numbers and interneuron-to-interneuron connectivity, are highly conserved. These conserved elements delineate a core circuit blueprint presumably required for fundamental olfactory processing. Superimposed on this scaffold, we find rewiring changes that mirror each species ecologies, including a systematic shift in the excitation-to-inhibition balance in the feedforward pathways. We further show that some neurons have changed more than others, and that even within individual neurons some synaptic elements remain conserved while others display major species-specific changes, suggesting evolutionary hot-spots within the circuit. Our findings reveal constrained and adaptable elements within olfactory networks, and establish a framework for identifying general principles in the evolution of neural circuits underlying behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1750025353183

Spacer acquisition relies on the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and accessory proteins like Cas4, which select DNA sequences flanked by the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and insert them into the CRISPR array. It has been shown that in type II-A systems selection of PAM-proximal prespacers is mediated by the effector nuclease Cas9, which forms a  supercomplex with the Cas1-Cas2 integrase and the Csn2 protein.

Common wisdom holds that G should respond to drift only as a scaled reduction. In contrast, I find that drift causes drastic and predictable shifts in the orientation of G by driving genetic correlations to their extremes. Biologically, this is a consequence of linkage build-up introduced by drift. I compare these theoretical results to empirical observations based on experiments conducted by Phillips et. al. (2001). Additionally, to derive the model of G-matrix evolution, I developed a novel synthetic framework for modelling ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations carrying multivariate traits. By striking a balance between genetic detail and analytical tractability, and by minimizing requisite technical background, this framework is optimized for deriving new models across a wide range of topics in population biology. Foundations of the framework are formalized by the theory of measure-valued processes, but application of the framework only requires multivariate calculus, and heuristics are presented in the main text for making additional calculations involving stochastic processes. Collectively, this work establishes a powerful framework enabling efficient formal analysis of integrated population processes across evolution and ecology, and its potential for making new discoveries is illustrated by novel findings on fundamental aspects of G-matrix evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Search queries may vary in size from short gene sequences to multiple whole genomes that are too large to fit in computer memory. In microbial genomics, a routine search application involving both large queries and large collections is the removal of contaminating host genome sequences from microbial (meta)genomes. Where the host is human, sensitive classification and excision of host sequences is usually necessary to protect host genetic information. Precise classification is also critical in order to retain microbial sequences and permit accurate microbial genomic analysis. While human pangenomes have been shown to increase sensitivity of human sequence classification, existing bioinformatic host depletion approaches have either limited precision when used with metagenomes or large computing resource requirements.

ResultsWe present Deacon, an efficient and versatile sequence filter for raw sequence files and streams. We demonstrate its leading accuracy for the task of host depletion, using less computing resource than existing approaches. By querying a human pangenome index for minimizers contained in each input sequence, Deacon is able to accurately classify and discard diverse human sequences from long reads at over 250Mbp/s with a commodity laptop. We present validation of classification sensitivity, specificity and speed with simulated short and long reads for diverse catalogues of human, bacterial and viral genomes alongside existing methods. Beyond host depletion, Deacon is well suited to common sequence search and filtering applications, particularly those involving large queries. Capable of indexing a human genome in under 30s, Deacon is equipped to rapidly compose custom minimizer indexes using set operations, facilitating efficient search and filtering of massive sequence datasets using gigabase queries.

Growth suppression by ppGpp is implicated in the formation of persister cells, which survive antibiotic challenge only to regrow once the drug is removed. However, there is also evidence that low levels of ppGpp contribute to resistance to certain cell wall-active antibiotics in actively growing cells. To characterize ppGpps contribution to antibiotic resistance, we measured MICs of a panel of {beta}-lactams in actively growing Escherichia coli cells overexpressing a ppGpp synthase (relA*). Cells engineered to modestly overproduce ppGpp exhibited up to 64-fold increases in resistance to PBP2-targeting {beta}-lactams only, with mecillinam the most dramatically affected. Resistance required the transcription factor DksA and the class A penicillin binding protein (PBP) PBP1B. PBP1B variants defective for transpeptidase activity, glycosyltransferase activity, or both were incapable of mediating resistance, suggesting the full enzymatic activity of PBP1B is required for resistance. Transcriptomics revealed that ppGpp overproduction leads to increased expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B. LpoB was required for mecillinam resistance, with an lpoB deletion mutant exhibiting a loss of ppGpp-dependent resistance. Resistance was partially lost in an lpoB deletion strain expressing an LpoB-bypass variant of PBP1B (mrcB*). Together these results support a model wherein overproduction of ppGpp favors cell wall synthesis by PBP1B, in part via increased expression of lpoB, allowing PBP1B to substitute for PBP2 when it is inhibited by {beta}-lactams.

ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance is an increasing global health threat, but the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance remain incompletely understood. This work clarifies the role of the alarmone ppGpp in mediating antibiotic resistance in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. Elevated levels of ppGpp were found to cause resistance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics targeting the cell wall synthesis enzyme PBP2. Resistance required transcriptional regulation by ppGpp and enzymatic activity of the cell wall enzyme PBP1B. This work suggests that ppGpp causes resistance in part by increasing expression of lpoB, which encodes an activator of PBP1B.

Furthermore, this study adds to a number of studies demonstrating that cell wall synthesizing PBP enzymes can compensate for one another under certain conditions, leading to {beta}-lactam resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Among these, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and extracellular targeted protein degradation (eTPD) specifically depend on efficient lysosomal trafficking for activity. However, many tumor antigens exhibit poor internalization, limiting ADC effectiveness. To address this, we developed low-density lipoprotein receptor-targeting chimeras (LIPTACs), leveraging the constitutive endocytic and recycling activity of the LDLR to enhance lysosomal delivery. LIPTACs enable efficient and selective degradation of diverse extracellular membrane proteins. Additionally, by coupling LIPTACs with cytotoxic payloads to generate degrader-drug conjugates, we can achieve superior intracellular delivery and enhanced cytotoxicity compared to conventional ADCs. The dual modality addresses key challenges of inadequate internalization in conventional ADCs and cytotoxic potency for current eTPD strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LDLR-mediated trafficking can enhance eTPD and ADCs, providing a hybrid blueprint for developing next-generation antibody therapeutics with broader utility and improved efficacy in cancer treatment.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

Lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenases (encoded by the gene xoxF) are now recognized as the key catalysts for methylotrophy in many environments, yet the identity of the most transcriptionally active methylotrophs (""Clade X"") has remained elusive. Here we show that ""Clade X"" methylotrophs belong to the deep-branching alphaproteobacterial order TMED127, which we propose be renamed  Methylaecorales;  methyl for  methylotrophic metabolism and  aecor for  ocean surface, as these bacteria are most transcriptionally active near the sea surface. TMED127/Methylaecorales have small, streamlined genomes ([~]1.5 Mb) and appear to be obligate methylotrophs that use the serine cycle for carbon assimilation. TMED127/Methylaecorales showed a diel pattern of xoxF5 and glucose dehydrogenase (gdh) transcription, peaking in the late afternoon, in oligotrophic surface water of the Sargasso Sea. Several other highly transcribed genes of unknown function had no homologs outside of TMED127/Methylaecorales genomes. Our findings illuminate an overlooked marine methylotrophic bacterium and predict a diel cycle of methanol production in surface seawater by an unknown pathway.

ImportanceMethanol metabolism is increasingly recognized as an important process in the marine carbon cycle, yet the identity and metabolism of the microorganisms mediating methylotrophy in the open ocean have remained unknown. This study reveals that bacteria in the TMED127 order of Alphaproteobacteria, proposed new name of ""Methylaecorales"", abundantly transcribe the key gene for lanthanide-dependent methylotrophy in oligotrophic surface waters of the worlds oceans. TMED127/Methylaecorales likely require methanol as a carbon and energy source, and display a diel pattern of transcription of key genes for methylotrophy that peaks in the late afternoon. These findings motivate future studies on the mechanisms of methanol production in surface seawater.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

We demonstrate that asparagine depletion at different time points after CD4+ T cell activation reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and function. Furthermore, asparagine depletion at specific time points during CD4+ T cell differentiation reduces cytokine production in multiple CD4+ T cell subsets. In an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myelin oligodendrocyte-specific pathogenic T helper 17 cells differentiated under Asn-deficient conditions exhibited reduced encephalitogenic potential and attenuated EAE severity. In a model of EAE induced by active immunization, therapeutic depletion of extracellular Asn significantly reduced disease severity. These results identify asparagine as a key metabolic regulator of the pathogenicity of autoreactive CD4+ T cells and suggest that targeting asparagine metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for autoimmunity.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

However, there is a population of TB patients who require longer treatment durations. Prospectively identifying those who require shorter versus longer treatment durations would support evaluation and implementation of optimized regimens.

MethodsWe analysed data from the RIFASHORT TB treatment-shortening non-inferiority trial to define a TB phenotype classification. The RIFASHORT trial primary outcome was reanalysed using the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion of eight percentage points, stratifying by those classified as having limited or extensive disease.

ResultsXpert MTB/RIF(R) semiquantitative bacterial burden in combination with TB disease involvement grading on chest X-ray achieved the strongest differentiation between relapse and non-relapse. The extensive disease TB phenotype (high semiquantitative bacterial burden and extensive TB disease on X-ray) accounted for one quarter of the RIFASHORT trial population and more than half of all post-treatment TB relapses (13/23). For the limited TB disease phenotype (<high semiquantitative bacterial burden or no extensive TB disease on X-ray), the experimental 4-month 1200mg rifampicin-containing regimen met the protocol-defined non-inferiority criterion in both modified-intention-to-treat (adjusted risk difference: -1.3% (95% confidence interval: -6.7% to 4.0%)) and per protocol analyses (1.7% (95% CI: -3.8% to 7.1%)).

ConclusionA four-month treatment duration, with a widely available, tolerable, rifampicin-based TB treatment regimen, was non-inferior to the standard of care for three-quarters of people with TB in the RIFASHORT trial. This finding justifies definitive evaluation of disease-stratified rifampicin-based TB treatment in a phase III randomised trial.

summaryXpert MTB/RIF(R) and chest radiography at TB treatment initiation identify a majority of patients for whom a 4-month treatment duration is non-inferior to the standard of care. These widely available measures may facilitate personalised TB treatment durations.","NA","medrxiv",1750025353183

The emergence of these increasingly large-scale connectomic datasets have intensified the need for efficient and accurate neuronal cell type identification. Traditional approaches rely on labor-intensive analyses of molecular, anatomical, and physiological features. As a step toward fully automated neuronal cell type classification, we present NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity) -- a method for grouping neurons into cell types based solely on synaptic connectivity. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that synaptic connectivity is key to determining neuronal cell types (Seung 2012), and our results provide the strongest evidence to date supporting its validity.

NTAC comes in two flavors: a semi-supervised variant that requires some of the neurons to be labeled, and an unsupervised variant that requires no labels at all. The first can be naturally formalized as a learning problem on graphs: given labels for a subset of neurons, use connectivity to label the rest. We present a simple and fast algorithm that achieves over 95% accuracy on the flys visual system starting with just 2% of neurons labeled, within minutes on a standard PC. In contrast, morphology based parallel achieves lower accuracy even on smaller datasets and with significantly more labels.

Formalizing the problem as a fully unsupervised learning task is more challenging. To address this, we introduce a novel computational problem, approximate equitable partitioning, and design an efficient heuristic for it, using the semi-supervised algorithm as a subroutine. Remarkably, the unsupervised method achieves [~]70% accuracy on the flys visual system, drastically outperforming its morphology based parallel and providing concrete evidence that synaptic connectivity alone can reveal cell types.

Both variants of NTAC are evaluated on multiple state of the art connectomes including optic lobes, central brain and nerve cord of adult fruit flies.","NA","biorxiv",1750025353183

How can we achieve high-density neural recordings with wide brain region access at single-neuron resolution, while maintaining long-term stability? In this study, we present a novel approach to overcome these trade-offs by introducing Fleuron, a family of ultrasoft, ultra-low-k dielectric materials compatible with thin-film scalable microfabrication techniques. We successfully integrate up to 1,024 channels within a single minimally invasive Fleuron depth electrode. The combination of the novel implant material and geometry enables single-unit level recordings for 18 months in rodent models, and achieves a large number of units detected per electrode across animals. 128-channel Fleuron probes, that cover 8x larger tissue volume than state-of-the-art polyimide counterparts, can track over 100 single-units over months. Stability in neural recordings correlates with reduced glial encapsulation compared to polyimide controls up to 9-month post-implantation. Fleuron probes are integrated with a low-power, mixed-signal ASIC to achieve over 1,000 channels electronic interfaces and can be safely implanted in depth using minimally invasive surgical techniques via a burr hole approach without requiring specialized robotics. Fleuron probes further create a unique contrast in clinical 3T MRI, allowing for post-operative position confirmation. Large-animal and ex vivo human tissue studies confirm safety and functionality in larger brains. Finally, Fleuron probes are used for the first time ever intraoperatively during planned resection surgeries, confirming in-human usability, and demonstrating the potential of the technology for clinical translation in iBCIs.","NA","medrxiv",1750025353183

PEM often results in avoidance of physical activity, resulting in a lower aerobic fitness, which may contribute to skeletal muscle abnormalities. Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1750025353183

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.
