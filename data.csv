With no known effective FDA-approved treatments for either condition, patient-reported outcomes of treatments are invaluable for guiding management strategies in patient care and generating new avenues for research. Here, we present the results of an ME/CFS and Long COVID treatment survey with responses from 3,925 patients. We assessed the experiences of these patients with more than 150 treatments, as well as their demographics, symptoms, and comorbidities. Patients with each condition who participated in the study shared similar symptom profiles, including all the core symptoms of ME/CFS, e.g., 89.7% of ME/CFS and 79.4% of Long COVID reported post-exertional malaise (PEM). Treatments with the greatest perceived benefits were identified, which had varied effects on different core symptoms. In addition, treatment responses were significantly correlated (R{superscript 2} = 0.68) between the two patient groups. Patient subgroups with distinct profiles of symptoms and comorbidities showed varied responses to treatments, e.g., a POTS-dominant cluster benefiting from autonomic modulators and a cognitive-dysfunction cluster from CNS stimulants. This study underscores the symptomatic and therapeutic similarities between ME/CFS and Long COVID and highlights the commonalities and nuanced complexities of infection-associated chronic diseases and related conditions. Insights from patient-reported experiences, in the absence of approved treatments, provide urgently needed real-world evidence for targeted therapies in patient care and for developing future clinical trials.

It is widely accepted that the spread of this language family across Europe from the 5th millennium BP correlates with the expansion and diversification of steppe-related genetic ancestry from the onset of the Bronze Age6,7. However, multiple steppe-derived populations co-existed in Europe during this period, and it remains unclear how these populations diverged and which provided the demographic channels for the ancestral forms of the Italic, Celtic, Greek, and Armenian languages8,9. To investigate the ancestral histories of Indo-European-speaking groups in Southern Europe, we sequenced genomes from 314 ancient individuals from the Mediterranean and surrounding regions, spanning from 5,200 BP to 2,100 BP, and co-analysed these with published genome data. We additionally conducted strontium isotope analyses on 224 of these individuals. We find a deep east-west divide of steppe ancestry in Southern Europe during the Bronze Age. Specifically, we show that the arrival of steppe ancestry in Spain, France, and Italy was mediated by Bell Beaker (BB) populations of Western Europe, likely contributing to the emergence of the Italic and Celtic languages. In contrast, Armenian and Greek populations acquired steppe ancestry directly from Yamnaya groups of Eastern Europe. These results are consistent with the linguistic Italo-Celtic10,11 and Graeco-Armenian1,12,13 hypotheses accounting for the origins of most Mediterranean Indo-European languages of Classical Antiquity. Our findings thus align with specific linguistic divergence models for the Indo-European language family while contradicting others. This underlines the power of ancient DNA in uncovering prehistoric diversifications of human populations and language communities.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Pseudomonas bacteria isolated from diseased liverworts in the wild successfully re-infected M. polymorpha in pure culture conditions, producing high in planta bacterial densities and causing prominent tissue maceration. Comparative genomic analysis of Marchantia-associated P. viridiflava identified core virulence machinery like the type-III secretion system (T3SS) and conserved effectors (AvrE and HopM1) that were essential for liverwort infection. Disease assays performed in Nicotiana benthamiana further confirmed that liverwort-associated P. viridiflava infect flowering plants in an effector-dependent manner. Our work highlights P. viridiflava as an effective broad host pathogen that relies on conserved virulence factors to manipulate evolutionarily divergent host plants.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

To counteract this, cells deploy dedicated silencing factors, such as the E3 ligase SIFI that terminates the mitochondrial stress response. How a single enzyme can sense stress across cells and elicit timely stress response inactivation is poorly understood. Here, we report the structure of human SIFI, which revealed how this 1.3MDa complex can target hundreds of proteins for accurate stress response silencing. SIFI attaches the first ubiquitin to substrates using flexible domains within an easily accessible scaffold, yet builds linkage-specific ubiquitin chains at distinct, sterically restricted elongation modules in its periphery. Ubiquitin handover via a ubiquitin-like domain couples versatile substrate modification to precise chain elongation. Stress response silencing therefore exploits a catalytic mechanism that is geared to process many diverse proteins and hence allows a single enzyme to monitor and, if appropriate, modulate a complex cellular state.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

We present LRGE, a novel tool that uses read-to-read overlap information to estimate genome size in a reference-free manner. LRGE calculates per-read genome size estimates by analysing the expected number of overlaps for each read, considering read lengths and a minimum overlap threshold. The final size is taken as the median of these estimates, ensuring robustness to outliers such as reads with no overlaps. Additionally, LRGE provides an expected confidence range for the estimate. LRGE outperforms k-mer-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency and produces genome size estimates comparable to those from assembly-based approaches, like Raven, while using significantly less computational resources. We validate LRGE on a large, diverse bacterial dataset and confirm it generalises to eukaryotic datasets. Availability and implementation: Our method, LRGE (Long Read-based Genome size Estimation from overlaps), is implemented in Rust and is available as a precompiled binary for most architectures, a Bioconda package, a prebuilt container image, and a crates.io package as a binary (lrge) or library (liblrge).

Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males--but not females.

MethodsTo probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation.

ResultsChemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions.

ConclusionsThe CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Besides the commonly used Agrobacterium strains, Rhizobium rhizogenes can also introduce foreign DNA into host plants for gene expression. While many R. rhizogenes strains have been known for inducing hairy root symptoms, their use for transient expression has not been fully explored. Here, we showed that R. rhizogenes A4 outperformed all other tested agrobacterial strains in agroinfiltration experiments on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana and other solanaceous plants. By conducting an agroinfiltration screening in N. benthamiana leaves using various agrobacterial strains carrying the RUBY reporter gene cassette, we discovered that A4 mediates the strongest and fastest transient expression. Utilizing the genomic information, we developed a collection of disarmed and modified strains derived from A4. By performing vacuum infiltration assays, we demonstrated that these A4-derived strains efficiently transiently transform 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves, showing less sensitivity to the age of plants compared to the laboratory strain GV3101. Furthermore, we performed agroinfiltration using AS109, an A4-derived disarmed strain, on the leaves of tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Remarkably, AS109 mediated transient gene expression on tested solanaceous plants more effectively than all the tested commonly used agrobacterial strains. This discovery paves the way for establishing R. rhizogenes A4-derived strains as a new option for enhancing transient expression in N. benthamiana and facilitating the functional study of plant genes in other solanaceous species.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

However, it is unlikely that the stability of the designs will significantly exceed that of the natural proteins in the training set, which are biophysically only marginally stable. Therefore, we collected predicted protein structures from hyperthermophiles, which differ substantially in their amino acid composition from mesophiles. Notably, ProteinMPNN fails to recover their unique amino acid composition. Here we show that a retrained network on predicted proteins from hyperthermophiles, termed HyperMPNN, not only recovers this unique amino acid composition but can also be applied to proteins from non-hyperthermophiles. Using this novel approach on a protein nanoparticle with a melting temperature of 65{degrees}C resulted in designs remaining stable at 95{degrees}C. In conclusion, we created a new way to design highly thermostable proteins through self-supervised learning on data from hyperthermophiles.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular basis of dietary adaptations in the massive radiation of cichlid fishes in Lake Tanganyika using comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic data derived from the intestines of 24 endemic cichlid species with distinct habitats and diets. We show that, at the cellular level, dietary adaptations are primarily driven by anterior enterocytes, and that both the relative abundance and gene expression profiles of these cells have evolved in response to rapid dietary specializations. These dietary adaptations are driven by rapidly evolving cell population-specific genes, suggesting that alterations in epithelial cell specification programs and molecular makeup promote ecological diversification.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Uptake of peptides by S. aureus involves at least two transport systems: the POT family di/tri-peptide permease DtpT and the oligopeptide ABC transporter Opp3. Here we study the individual and combined functions of DtpT and Opp3 in enabling utilisation of 282 di-/tri-peptides via a high-throughput phenotypic screen. We reveal that many peptides can be utilised via either transporter, though DtpT appears to be the primary route of uptake for dipeptides. Intriguingly, we demonstrate a preference for Asp/Glu-containing peptides among putative DtpT substrates. To measure DtpT-mediated peptide transport directly, the protein was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes and active transport of diverse di- and tri-peptides was demonstrated, supporting the conclusions of the phenotypic screen. During this in vitro analysis, we also found that DtpT could transport the biologically prevalent tripeptide reduced glutathione (GSH). In the absence of the known glutathione transporter Gis, dtpT is essential for growth under conditions where GSH is supplied as the sole sulphur source, identifying DtpT as the predicted second GSH uptake system of S. aureus. Site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted ligand binding site of DtpT suggests GSH binds the protein vertically in a manner dependent on interactions with Gln310. Finally, we demonstrate that GSH transport is required by S. aureus for complete fitness during in vitro macrophage infection experiments, and our data suggest that GSH uptake plays a role in modulating host-pathogen interactions in these infections. Together, these data reveal important new functions for DtpT, both in the utilisation of diverse peptides for growth but also providing the first clues toward a distinct role of DtpT during intracellular infection.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, agonist binding triggers rapid transition through a series of intermediate states leading to a transient open-pore conformation. These transitions are usually framed in terms of a mechanism where agonist binding and channel activation are separate events. Here, we collect cryo-EM images over a range of agonist concentrations to define structures of the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in unliganded, mono-liganded, and di-liganded states. We show that agonist binding to a single agonist site stabilizes an intermediate state where an entire principal agonist-binding subunit has transitioned to an active-like conformation, while the other unoccupied principal subunit remains inactive, albeit poised for activation. Binding of agonist to the second agonist site fully activates the remaining subunits leading to hydration of the ion pore. Uniting this cryo-EM derived intermediate structure with single-channel recordings leads to a model where individual acetylcholine receptor subunits asynchronously undergo conformational transitions, and thus a sequential activation mechanism that has implications for the entire superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

With the advance of population genomics, studies in diverse organisms revealed supergenes associated with a myriad of complex traits, ranging from morphology to sexual behavior, from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. Two supergenes have been described on non-homologous ""social chromosomes"" in two ant lineages, Solenopsis and Formica, that diverged more than 90 million years ago. In both lineages, the supergene is associated with social polymorphism, where some colonies are headed by a single queen (monogyne) while others harbor multiple queens (polygyne). We discovered a new supergene associated with similar social polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Although Cataglyphis is more closely related to Formica than to Solenopsis, the social chromosome in C. niger is homologous to the Solenopsis social chromosome, with conservation of synteny in gene content as well as gene order. Therefore, this is an ancient chromosome dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Previous work dated the Solenopsis supergene to be only one million years old, therefore, we propose that the two supergenes have evolved independently in the two diverged lineages on this ancient social chromosome. We surveyed hymenopteran genomes to discover a bee chromosome homologous to the ants social chromosome. The conservation of the gene set on these homologous chromosomes in ants and bees suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera. We hypothesize that the conserved gene set in the social chromosome was repeatedly used as a pre-adapted toolkit for the evolution of social traits in general and specifically in the evolution of polygyne social structure in ants.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

By training a decoder to estimate navigational heading and velocity from PPC activity during virtual navigation, we discovered that mice could immediately navigate toward goal locations when control was switched to BMI. No learning or adaptation was observed during BMI, indicating that naturally occurring PPC activity patterns are sufficient to drive navigational trajectories in real time. During successful BMI trials, decoded trajectories decoupled from the mouses physical movements, suggesting that PPC activity relates to intended trajectories. Our work demonstrates a role for PPC in navigation and offers a BMI approach for investigating causal links between neural activity and behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

However, most non-model organisms lack integral genomic resources such as reference genomes and recombination maps, limiting accurate evolutionary inference. Here, we explore the consequences of reference genome bias on the inference of genetic diversity, demographic histories, and recombination rates using gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), which, like most members of Canidae, are traditionally mapped to the dog (Canis lupus familiaris) reference genome. Whole genome sequence data from gray foxes were mapped to the gray fox reference genome and two heterospecific canid references (dog and Arctic fox; Vulpes lagopus). Our results reveal that reference bias significantly affects population genomic analyses. Mapping to the conspecific gray fox genome improved read pairing, increased detection of SNPs, especially rare variants, and reduced spurious variants. Estimates of nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and genetic differentiation (FST) were higher using the gray fox genome. We observed that mapping to heterospecific references leads to underestimates of population sizes, distorted demographic trajectories, and more variable recombination rates. These effects are further complicated by population-specific biases, which vary in their magnitude and direction across populations, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to mitigate reference bias. Importantly, FST outlier detection also differed among references, affecting functional interpretations. Collectively, this work addresses a critical gap in the rapidly expanding field of non-model species genomics by demonstrating the importance of using conspecific genomic resources in evolutionary research and illustrating how reliance on distantly related reference genomes can distort population genetic analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

The recent approval of TCR-gene-edited T cells for cancer therapy demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of using pMHC recognition to eliminate cancer. However, identification and selection of TCRs from patient material is complex and influenced by the TCR repertoire of the donors used. To overcome these limitations, we here present a rapid and robust de novo binder design platform leveraging state-of-the-art generative models, including RFdiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2, to engineer minibinders (miBds) targeting the cancer-associated pMHC complex, NY-ESO-1(157-165)/HLA-A*02:01. By incorporating in silico cross-panning and molecular dynamics simulations, we enhanced specificity screening to minimise off-target interactions. We identified a miBd that exhibited high specificity for the NY-ESO-1-derived peptide SLLMWITQC in complex with HLA-A*02:01 and minimal cross-reactivity in mammalian display assays. We further demonstrate the therapeutic potential of this miBd by integrating it into a chimeric antigen receptor, as de novo Binders for Immune-mediated Killing Engagers (BIKEs). BIKE-transduced T cells selectively and effectively killed NY-ESO-1+ melanoma cells compared to non-transduced controls, demonstrating the promise of this approach in precision cancer immunotherapy. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of generative protein design for accelerating the discovery of high-specificity pMHC-targeting therapeutics. Beyond CAR-T applications, our workflow establishes a foundation for developing miBds as versatile tools, heralding a new era of precision immunotherapy.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Given the high incidence and deleterious consequences of epileptiform activity in AD, we hypothesized neuronal hyperactivity and seizures are key factors in tau spread. To examine these interactions, we created a novel mouse model involving the cross of targeted recombination in active populations (TRAP) mice and the 5 times familial AD (5XFAD; 5X-TRAP) model allowing for the permanent fluorescent labelling of neuronal activity. To establish a causal role of seizures in tau spread, we seeded mice with human AD brain-derived tau lysate and induced seizures with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling. Comprehensive brain mapping of tau pathology and neuronal activity revealed that basal hyperactivity in 5X-TRAP mice was associated with increased tau spread, which was exacerbated by seizure induction through activated networks and correlated with memory deficits. Computational modeling revealed that anterograde tau spread was elevated in 5X-TRAP mice and that regional neuronal activity was predictive of tau spread to that brain region. On a cellular level, we found that in both saline and PTZ-treated 5X-TRAP mice, hyperactive neurons disproportionately contributed to the spread of tau. Further, we found that Synaptogyrin-3, a synaptic vesicle protein that interacts with tau, was increased following PTZ kindling in 5X-TRAP mice, possibly indicative of a synaptic mechanism underlying seizure-exacerbated tau spread. Importantly, postmortem AD brain tissue from patients with a history of seizures showed increased tau pathology in patterns indicative of increased spread and increased Synaptogyrin-3 levels compared to those without seizures. Overall, our study identifies neuronal hyperactivity and seizures as key factors underlying the pathobiological and cognitive progression of AD. Therapies targeting these factors should be tested clinically to slow tau spread and AD progression.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

While movement plans can be computed relative to the world (extrinsic), intrinsic muscle commands tuned for current limb posture are ultimately needed to execute spatially accurate movements. The whole-brain topology and dynamics of this process are largely unknown. Here, we use high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans combined with a Pro-/Anti-wrist pointing task with 2 opposing forearm postures to investigate this question. First, we computed cortical source activity in 16 previously identified bilateral cortical areas (Alikhanian, et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience 2013). We then contrasted oscillatory activity related to opposing wrist postures to find posture coding and test when and where extrinsic and intrinsic motor codes occurred. We found a distinct pair of overlapping networks coding for posture (predominantly in {gamma} band) vs. posture-specific movement plans ( and {beta}). Some areas (e.g., pIPS) only showed extrinsic motor coding, and others (e.g., AG) only showed intrinsic coding, but the majority showed both types of codes. In the latter case, intrinsic codes appeared slightly before extrinsic codes and persisted in parallel across different cortical areas. These findings are consistent with two cortical networks for 1) direct feed-forward sensorimotor transformations to intrinsic muscle coordinates (for rapid control) and 2) computations of extrinsic spatial coordinates, possibly for use in higher-level aspects of visually-guided action, such as spatial updating and internal performance monitoring.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Mechanical cues exerted by shear stress from the blood flow remodel an initial vascular plexus into a ramifying array of large and small vessels. As plasma starts to fill vascular lumens, these forces trigger changes in EC gene expression and dynamic alterations in cell shape and cell adhesion, as cuboidal angioblasts elongate and flatten into ECs. Little is known about how embryonic ECs sense and transduce hemodynamic signals as vessels form in vivo. Here, we report a critical requirement for the Lats1 and Lats2 Hippo pathway kinases during this process. We show that when Lats1/2 are genetically deleted in ECs, embryos develop severe defects in blood vessel formation, which lead to embryonic lethality by E11.5. We find that initial vessel patterning and circulation initiate properly, however remodeling of the initial vascular plexus fails due to lumen collapse and altered blood flow. When Lats1/2 are knocked down using siRNA approaches in cultured ECs, cells fail to elongate and polarize, similar to ECs in the mutant embryos. In addition, VE-cadherin (VEcad) based junctions fail to mature under shear stress. These data show that Lats1/2 deficient cells no longer respond to laminar shear stress, both in vivo and in vitro. This work identifies the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1 and Lats2 as critical transducers of biomechanical cues during the early steps of blood vessel remodeling. This study will provide new targets for treatment of vascular diseases and new directions for efforts to generate vascularized tissues for replacement therapies.

Still, the mechanisms for these headache types are unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess levels of amyloid related biomarkers in patients with persistent headache after COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

MethodsIn this prospective observational cohort, patients with severe headache as the dominating symptom after COVID-19 disease (n=29) and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (n=31), had neurological assessments with reassessments after 6 months. Plasma levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), cathepsin L1 (CTSL) and serum Amyloid A (SAA1) were measured by ELISA in relation to levels in healthy controls (n=16).

ResultsWe found a strong and persistent upregulation of APP in patients with headache after COVID-19 as compared to the two other groups. At both inclusion and after 6 months APP levels were also increased in those with accompanying cognitive symptoms. In contrast, plasma levels of PZP were elevated in both headache groups as compared to healthy controls at inclusion and after 6 months follow-up, but with no relation to cognitive symptoms. CTSL was only elevated in those with COVID-19 associated headache at baseline, whereas SAA1 showed levels comparable in all groups.

ConclusionAltered plasma levels of soluble markers potentially reflecting changes in amyloid processing was found in patients with persistent headache after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and particular in those with persistent headache after COVID-19 disease where we also found some association with cognitive symptoms.

Its strength rivals that of many synthetic fibres used commercially, rendering it applicable across various industrial and medical domains. However, its widespread utilisation requires cost-effective mass production. Biotechnology presents a promising avenue for achieving this goal, particularly through the production of recombinant dragline silk proteins in transgenic plant systems. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of producing one key protein component of dragline silk, MaSp1, from the western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, (LhMaSp1) in the moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens). Here, we present the successful recombinant production of spider silk protein containing both the N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) of LhMaSp1 protein in moss cells. NTD and CTD are necessary domains for protein assembly in spider silk. The production of recombinant LhMaSp1 protein in Physcomitrella was performed in shake flasks and in five-litre photobioreactors and the correct synthesis of LhMaSp1 was proven via mass spectrometry.

Temperature gradients have influenced the evolution and biogeography of MAST-4 species. Yet, similarly to most uncultured microbes, there is limited information on the population diversity and structure within MAST-4 species. This information is key for better comprehending the ecological roles and adaptations of different MAST-4 species to specific ocean niches. Here, we investigate the population diversity and structure on the global scale of the MAST-4 species A, B, C, and E by combining metagenomics and single-cell genomics data from the Tara Oceans expedition. We found substantial population divergence in the abundant MAST-4A and C species, while lower levels of divergence were observed in species B and E. Temperature and salinity were the main drivers structuring the populations within the four MAST-4 species. The analysis of positively selected gene clusters within each MAST-4 species revealed genomic areas likely the basis of population adaptation to different niches. Overall, our results contribute to a better comprehension of the population diversity and structure of four species belonging to an important group of unicellular predators, offering insights into their ecological roles and adaptations in the global ocean.

Here, using experimental evolution, we show that the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae can adapt to freeze-thaw stress in a stereotyped manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from ~2% to ~70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Adapted cells exhibit reduced membrane damage, smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and a lower prevalence of budding. Rheological measurements show that the adapted cells are stiffer and exhibit lower particle mobilities within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicates that increased survival is not accompanied by specific (unique) genetic changes, but rather is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes. Concomitant with mechanical changes in the adapted cells, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity, exhibits a three-fold increase. Together, these cellular attributes strongly correlate with the entry of cells into a quiescence-like state. A quantitative model that incorporates selection based on cellular quiescence recapitulates the adaptation dynamics, i.e. increase in survival and trehalose levels, seen in experiments. Finally, we find that the evolved mechano-chemical phenotypes are similar even when we use qualitatively different freeze-thaw selection protocols for the evolution, hinting at a convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Here, we investigated whether a SARS-CoV-2 infection alone increases the susceptibility to develop parkinsonian phenotypes in C57BL/6J mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, or in addition to two well-known toxin exposures, MPTP and paraquat. Additionally, we examined mice carrying a G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene. We also examined if vaccination with either an mRNA- or protein-based vaccine can alter any observed neuropathology. We find that the infection with the WA-1/2020 (alpha) or omicron B1.1.529 strains in ACE2 and G2019S LRRK2 mice both synergize with a subtoxic exposure to the mitochondrial toxin MPTP to induce neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra.

This synergistic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is rescued in WT mice that were vaccinated using either mRNA- and protein-based vaccines directed against the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, in the G2019S LRRK2 mutant mice, we find that only the protein-based vaccine but not the mRNA-based vaccine resulted in a rescue of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated neuropathology. Taken together, our results highlight the role of both environmental exposures and familial background on the development of parkinsonian pathology secondary to viral infection and the benefit of vaccines in reducing these risks.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

The classical experimental method for measuring metabolic fluxes makes use of stable-isotope tracing of metabolites through the metabolic network, followed by mass spectrometry analysis. The most common 13C-based metabolic flux analysis requires multidisciplinary knowledge in analytical chemistry, cell biology, and mathematical modelling, as well as the use of multiple independent tools for handling mass spectrometry data. Besides, flux analysis is usually carried out within a small network to validate a specific biological hypothesis. To overcome interdisciplinary barriers and extend flux interpretation towards a genome-scale level, we developed fluxTrAM, a semi-automated pipeline for processing tracer-based metabolomics data and integrating it with atomically resolved genome-scale metabolic networks to enable flux predictions at genome-scale. fluxTrAM integrates different software packages inside and outside of the COBRA Toolbox v3.4 for the generation of metabolite structure and reaction databases for a genome-scale model, labelled mass spectrometry data processing into standardised mass isotopologue distribution data (MID), and metabolic flux analysis. To demonstrate the utility of this pipeline, we generated 13C-labeled metabolomics data on an in vitro human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neuronal culture and processed 13C-labeled MID datasets. In parallel, we generated a cheminformatic database of standardised and context-specific metabolite structures, and atom-mapped reactions for a genome-scale dopaminergic neuronal metabolic model. MID data could be exported into established flux inference software for conventional flux inference on a core model scale. It could also be integrated into the atomically resolved metabolic model for flux inference at genome-scale using moiety fluxomics method. The core model flux solution and moiety flux solution were then compared to two additional flux solutions predicted via flux balance analysis and entropic flux balance analysis. The extensive computational flux analysis and comparison helped to better evaluate the obtained flux feasibility of the neuron-specific genome-scale model and suggested new tracer-based metabolomics experiments with novel labeling configurations, such as labelling a moiety within the thymidine metabolite. Overall, fluxTrAM enables the automation of labelled liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS) data processing into MID datasets and atom mapping for any given genome-scale metabolic model. It contributes to the standardisation and high throughput of metabolic flux analysis at genome-scale.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

These two groups of taxa show contrasting trends in the molecular mechanisms of 3D chromatin organization and long-term evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory element (CREs) conservation. To help us identify shared versus derived features that could be responsible for the evolution of these different regulatory architectures in animals, we studied the evolution and organization of the regulatory genome of echinoderms, a lineage whose phylogenetic position and relatively slow molecular evolution has proven particularly useful for evolutionary studies. First, using PacBio and HiC data, we generated new reference genome assemblies for two species belonging to two different echinoderm classes: the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and the bat sea star Patiria miniata. Second, we characterized their 3D chromatin architecture, identifying TAD-like domains in echinoderms that, like in flies, do not seem to be associated with CTCF motif orientation. Third, we systematically profiled CREs during sea star and sea urchin development using ATAC-seq, comparing their regulatory logic and dynamics over multiple developmental stages. Finally, we investigated sea urchin and sea star CRE evolution across multiple evolutionary distances and timescales, from closely related species to other echinoderm classes and deuterostome lineages. This showed the presence of several thousand elements conserved for hundreds of millions of years, revealing a vertebrate-like pattern of CRE evolution that probably constitutes an ancestral property of the regulatory evolution of animals.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a neural hub encoding mood and motivation that contributes to the locomotor and mood dampening effects of neuroinflammation. Dopamine receptor 1 mediums spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) of the NAc regulate locomotor activity, motivated behavior and emotional states and are modulated by microglial reactivity. Here, we evaluated sickness- and anxiety-like behaviors along with D1-MSN activity and microglial responses in the NAc to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. LPS stimulated anxiety-like behavior, blunted locomotion and reduced cFos expression in D1-MSNs of the NAc core and shell of male mice. These effects associated with reduced excitatory inputs (EPSCs) onto D1-MSNs as measured by whole cell patch-clamp. To determine if microglia contribute to changes in MSN activity, Ca2+ imaging of primary cultures containing NAc neurons with or without primary NAc microglia was performed. The presence of microglia decreased the activity of LPS-treated MSNs in response to dopamine and glutamate application and LPS stimulated microglial phagocytosis of MSN processes in co-cultures. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that in vivo LPS treatment enhanced morphological indices of microglia reactivity and engulfment of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) inputs in the NAc. Our results suggest that LPS reduces locomotion and stimulates anxiety via increasing microglia engulfment of excitatory inputs onto D1-MSNs, and highlight changes in NAc microglia phagocytic activity in the behavioral consequences of neuroinflammation.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Here we describe the use of deep learning-based protein design tools to de novo design small proteins that arc above the peptide binding groove of pMHC complexes and make extensive contacts with the peptide. We identify specific binders for ten target pMHCs which when displayed on yeast bind the on-target pMHC tetramer but not closely related peptides. For five targets, incorporation of designs into chimeric antigen receptors leads to T-cell activation by the cognate pMHC complexes well above the background from complexes with peptides derived from proteome. Our approach can generate high specificity binders starting from either experimental or predicted structures of the target pMHC complexes, and should be widely useful for both protein and cell based pMHC targeting.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

By combining unbiased Polylox barcoding with computational inference, we comprehensively mapped tissue macrophage ontogeny in mice from gastrulation to adult organs. Our data reveal a lineage tree of all tissue macrophages. This tree originates from a pan-hematopoietic progenitor at embryonic day (E)6.5 and branches, via oligolineage progenitors (E7.5-E9.5), into organ-specific macrophage lineages by E10.5. Barcode analysis in embryonic tissues and adult organ fragments suggests that local macrophage colonies, formed by organ-specific progenitors, persist into adulthood. Indeed, spatial fate mapping with Polytope barcoding detects local Kupffer cell colonies of the size predicted by the lineage tree model. Our findings uncover the origin of tissue-resident macrophages from a lineage tree, and show how holistic barcoding can comprehensively map complex cellular lineage specification.

The replisome-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP mitigates this threat by ubiquitylating the CMG helicase in mitosis, leading to disassembly of stalled replisomes, fork cleavage, and restoration of chromosome structure by alternative end-joining. Here, we show that replisome disassembly requires TRAIP phosphorylation by the mitotic Cyclin B-CDK1 kinase, as well as TTF2, a SWI/SNF ATPase previously implicated in the eviction of RNA polymerase from mitotic chromosomes. We find that TTF2 tethers TRAIP to replisomes using an N-terminal Zinc finger that binds to phosphorylated TRAIP and an adjacent TTF2 peptide that contacts the CMG-associated leading strand DNA polymerase {varepsilon}. This TRAIP-TTF2-pol {varepsilon} bridge, which forms independently of the TTF2 ATPase domain, is essential to promote CMG unloading and stalled fork breakage. Conversely, RNAPII eviction from mitotic chromosomes requires the ATPase activity of TTF2. We conclude that in mitosis, replisomes undergo a CDK- and TTF2-dependent structural reorganization that underlies the cellular response to incompletely replicated DNA.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Recently, a two-step mechanism, with the enzymes cytochrome P450 2J19 (CYP2J19) and 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase 1-like (BDH1L), was described for the biosynthesis of red ketocarotenoids from yellow dietary carotenoids in the retina and plumage of birds. A common assumption has been that all birds with ketocarotenoid-based plumage coloration used this CYP2J19/BDH1L mechanism to produce red feathers. We tested this assumption in house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) by examining the catalytic function of the house finch homologs of these enzymes and tracking their expression in molting birds. We found that CYP2J19 and BDH1L did not catalyze the production of 3-hydroxy-echinenone (3-OH-echinenone), the primary red plumage pigment of house finches, when provided with common dietary carotenoid substrates. Moreover, gene expression analyses revealed little to no expression of CYP2J19 in liver tissue or growing feather follicles, the putative sites of pigment metabolism in molting house finches. Finally, although the hepatic mitochondria of house finches have high concentrations of 3-OH-echinenone, observations using fluorescent markers suggest that both CYP2J19 and BDH1L localize to the endomembrane system rather than the mitochondria. We propose that house finches and other birds that deposit 3-OH-echinenone as their primary red plumage pigment use an alternative enzymatic pathway to produce their characteristic red ketocarotenoid-based coloration.","NA","biorxiv",1733263725544

Notably, key RBFs such as der, obgE, and rbfA, considered indispensable, are conserved in only around 20%-70% of CPR genomes. Since such repertoires were not observed in reduced genomes of other phyla, CPR presumably diverged early in bacterial evolution. We further confirmed that ribosomal structural changes correlate with reduced RBFs, evidencing co-evolution between RBFs and the ribosome. These findings suggest that ribosomal biogenesis is more flexible than recognized, and the small cell and genome sizes of CPR bacteria and their early divergence may influence the unusual repertoires of RBFs.

However, OrthoRep-based GOI evolution has almost always started from single GOI sequences, limiting the number of locations on a fitness landscape from where evolutionary search begins.

We sought to understand how three effector candidates (EFC1, EFC2, and EFC3) expressed in the first stages of Austropuccinia psidii (myrtle rust) infection influence pathogenicity. We experimentally tested gene function through application of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and characterised the genomic landscape of putative effectors expressed during infection to assess whether putative effectors are needed for infection, and whether they are under selection pressure. One of the three screened candidates, EFC1, met our criteria of an effector in that it was predicted to be secreted, and was needed to cause but not maintain infection. We identified that this effector belongs to a gene family of intragenomic variants in tandem repeats flanked by transposable elements. Single nucleotide polymorphisms among these variants have signatures of non-neutral selection. This effector has predicted structural homology to a glycosaminoglycan-binding domain and may have a role in pectin or chitin-binding.

Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total.

PREVENT-19 (NCT04611802/2019nCoV-301), a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated robust efficacy of a primary, 2-dose series of NVX-CoV2373 against COVID-19.

MethodsProtocol expansions to PREVENT-19 included enrollment of adolescents (aged 12 to <18 years) and administration of 3rd and 4th doses of NVX-CoV2373 to adults and adolescents. Participants randomized 2:1 received NVX-CoV2373 or placebo 21 days apart; 3rd and 4th doses were administered [&ge;]6 months after the preceding dose. Secondary and additional assessments included post-3rd- and 4th-dose immune responses (neutralizing antibody [nAb], anti-rS IgG, human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2-receptor binding inhibition [hACE2-RBI]) and response durability (post-3rd dose) to ancestral virus; cross-reactivity to Omicron subvariants; safety; and reactogenicity.

ResultsImmune responses were observed against ancestral virus after two doses of NVX-CoV2373 but not after placebo. In both adults and adolescents, additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 increased nAb titers, anti-rS IgG levels, and hACE2-RBI; durable responses were recorded 8 months post 3rd dose. nAb responses post 3rd dose were noninferior to those post primary series. Cross-reactivity to BA.5 and BQ.1.1 variants was also observed, with anti-rS IgG levels post 3rd or 4th dose exceeding previously reported correlates of protection. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated, with no new safety signals.

ConclusionsNVX-CoV2373 elicited robust and durable humoral immune responses to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 as a 3rd and 4th dose after the primary series in adults and adolescents. Cross-reactivity to relevant variants provides insight into potential protection against antigenically related, but shifted, viral strains. Additional doses of NVX-CoV2373 were well tolerated with no new safety signals. These results support the utility of this vaccine platform and continued updates, based on currently circulating strains, to help effectively combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Mechanical thrombectomy has become a standard treatment to remove obstructive clots, providing a unique opportunity to analyze their properties. We previously demonstrated that blood can clot into an amyloid-like form, generating fibrinaloid microclots (2-200 m) that are highly resistant to fibrinolysis. In this study, archived clots from eight ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion were examined, using samples stored in the Walton Centre Clot Bank in Liverpool, UK. All clots exhibited strong, heterogeneous amyloid staining, revealing a pervasive amyloid component. These findings represent a previously unreported characteristic of stroke clots, highlighting the potential for amyloid-targeted therapies to overcome their fibrinolytic resistance and providing a foundational new insight into ischaemic stroke pathophysiology and treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1733263725544

MethodsThis phase 3, open-label study (2019nCoV-312/NCT05875701) enrolled participants who received one dose of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 protein-based vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in an earlier study (2019nCoV-307/NCT05463068) after a primary series and possibly one additional dose of mRNA vaccine. In the current study, participants received an additional dose of protein-based vaccine (ancestral [n=104] or Omicron BA.5 [n=40]) at least 180 days after their previous study dose. The primary objective was demonstration of noninferiority of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers induced by the dose in this study versus the first dose of NVX-CoV-2373 in the earlier study. Safety was also evaluated.

ResultsA total of 144 participants were enrolled. The ratio of anti-Wuhan nAbs (GMT, IU/mL [95% CI]) at Day 28 after this study dose (ancestral 393.2 [318.0-468.2]) versus previous study dose (396.6 [328.7-478.6]) was 1.0 (0.8, 1.2), meeting noninferiority. The seroresponse rate difference between doses was 7.4% (95% CI = -1.2%-16.5%), also meeting noninferiority. Omicron BA.5 nAb titers suggest cross-protection against emerging variants. The nAb ratio at Day 28 between Omicron dose in this study (835.0 [597.1-1167.6]) versus previous study ancestral dose (436.0 [305.6-622.2]) was 1.9 (1.5-2.5), exceeding superiority criterion. Local and systemic reactions were similar between doses and strains in both studies.

ConclusionsA heterologous regimen of two adjuvanted recombinant spike protein-based vaccine doses after mRNA vaccination produced robust immune responses, exhibiting cross-reactivity to newer variants.","NA","medrxiv",1733263725544

From 2022, the national vaccination programme has been run twice per year, prioritising older age groups or those classified as clinically vulnerable. Here we assess the trends in COVID-19 outcomes between September 2023 and April 2024, using national-level data held by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

MethodsData linkage of national-level COVID-19 episode data, NHS emergency and hospital attendance data, and death registrations were used to analyse COVID-19 outcomes. Outcomes were defined as COVID-19 associated A&E attendances, hospital admissions, severe hospitalisations, and deaths.

The number and rate of each COVID-19 outcome category between September 2023 and April 2024 was calculated, stratified by clinical risk status and age and sex.

ResultsThe most common COVID-19 outcomes during this time-period were A&E attendance and hospital admission, with the rates highest among those aged 75 and over. Among this age group, all outcomes disproportionately affect those who have been identified as at clinical risk and those who were immunosuppressed.

High rates of A&E attendance and hospital admission were also observed among infants (under 6 months old) but were lower for more severe outcomes.

DiscussionGroups that were most affected by COVID-19 outcomes were currently prioritised for COVID-19 vaccination in England, which will help protect against more severe outcomes including admission to intensive care and death.

Routine national levels surveillance of COVID-19 outcomes is essential to monitor populations most of severe disease and informing vaccination policy.","NA","medrxiv",1733263725544

Immunity has been acquired through natural infection, primary and booster vaccination, while protection has been lost through waning immunity and viral mutation. During the height of the pandemic in England, the main aim was to rapidly protect the population and large supplies of vaccine were pre-purchased, eliminating the need for cost-effective calculations. As we move to an era where for the majority of the population SARS-CoV-2 infections cause relatively mild disease, and vaccine stocks need to be re-purchased, it is important we consider the cost-effectiveness and economic value of COVID-19 vaccination programmes.

MethodsHere using data from 2023 and 2024 in England on COVID-19 hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths, coupled with bespoke health economic costs, we consider the willingness to pay threshold for COVID-19 vaccines in different age and risk groups. We partition the population into sixteen 5-year age-groups and three risk groups (no-risk, at-risk and immunosuppressed) and calculate the health savings, in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), per vaccine dose. We adopt three different methodological approaches to estimate the level of vaccine protection leading to five different estimates of efficacy.

FindingsWillingness to pay thresholds vary from less than {pound}1 for younger age-groups without any risk factors, to over {pound}100 for older age-groups with comorbidities that place them at risk. This extreme non-linear dependence on age, means that despite the different method of estimating vaccine efficacy, there is considerable qualitative agreement on the willingness to pay threshold, and therefore which ages it is cost-effective to vaccinate. For pre-purchased vaccine, where the only cost is administration ({approx}{pound}10), a twice-yearly universal booster offer to all those aged 70 and over is cost-effective (the benefits outweigh the administration costs), while for the at-risk group this could be extended to those over 65. When the vaccine cost is included, the cost-effective ages reduce, such that at a total cost of {pound}30 (for vaccine and administration) universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 75; while at {pound}60 universal vaccine is only cost-effective for those over 80.

InterpretationThe historic offer of COVID-19 vaccination to those 65 and over for the autumn 2023 programme and those over 75 for the spring 2023 programme, aligns with our cost-effective threshold for pre-purchased vaccine when the only cost was administration. However, for future programmes, when vaccine costs are included, the age-thresholds slowly increase thereby demonstrating the continued importance of protecting the eldest and most vulnerable in the population.","NA","medrxiv",1733263725544

Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of the clonal landscapes of human tissues, and their impact on cancer risk, ageing and disease, remains limited due to the challenge of detecting somatic mutations present in small numbers of cells. Here, we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)11, a duplex sequencing method with error rates <5 errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted gene sequencing. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity enables the simultaneous detection of mutations in large numbers of clones, yielding accurate somatic mutation rates, mutational signatures and driver mutation frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 samples of blood from a twin cohort, we found an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection, with 49 genes under positive selection driving clonal expansions in the oral epithelium, over 62,000 driver mutations, and evidence of negative selection in some genes. The high number of positively selected mutations in multiple genes provides high-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites, a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how carcinogenic exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition and selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing has the potential to unveil the polyclonal landscape of any tissue, providing a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.","NA","medrxiv",1733263725544

Genomic analysis has identified a lineage with limited internal diversity most closely related to a genome sequence from a sporadic case sampled in 2014 in Uganda, though the lineages have diverged from a common ancestor that was circulating for decades in the animal reservoir.

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin. Results of investigations linked the index case to a mining cave inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus (the Egyptian fruit bat), where three individuals tested seropositive for IgG and IgM, further supporting the zoonotic origin of the outbreak through human-animal interactions.","NA","medrxiv",1733263725544
