This precludes detection of low-abundance proteins and weak signalling events with biological importance and therapeutic potential. We introduce single-molecule Flow Cytometry (smFC), integrating high-numerical aperture oblique plane microscopy (OPM) with microfluidics to achieve optical sectioning and photon collection efficiencies suitable for single-molecule detection on flowing cells. Using super-bright, large Stokes shift fluorophores, smFC can detect labelled membrane proteins on cells with digital precision down to ~2 molecules per cell, compared to an unlabelled control. This represents an improvement in the detection limit of 10 to 80-fold depending on the probe. We apply smFC to quantify the distribution of the membrane receptor c-kit in triple-negative breast cancer cells with unprecedented sensitivity. This revealed a previously unidentified distribution of 60% c-kit negative cells and 40% with low-abundance but heterogenous (1-200 mol/cell) surface distribution that is undetectable by conventional FC. These results establish smFC as a robust platform for high-throughput, quantitative single-molecule analysis in cell populations, opening new avenues for detecting rare biomarkers and quantifying the presence of low-abundance membrane proteins and targetable surface molecules with digital precision.","[{""name"":""Royal Society Research Grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""RGSR2202446;""},{""name"":""Academy of Medical Sciences"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00c489v88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""SBF0061138;""},{""name"":""UK Research and Innovation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/001aqnf71"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""EP/T517860/1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305727

While most enterovirus infections are mild and self-limiting, severe complications ranging from meningitis, encephalitis, to acute flaccid paralysis can occur, especially in children and immunocompromised patients. Despite the global burden of neurological complications caused by EV-D68 and EV-A71, the underlying neuropathogenesis remains poorly understood. In particular, the impact of the infection on neural function has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we compare the replication kinetics, cellular tropism, and electrophysiological effects of EV-D68 and EV-A71 infection in a physiologically relevant human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural co-culture model, consisting of excitatory neurons and astrocytes. Inoculation with contemporary circulating EV-D68 strains and an EV-A71 strain resulted in decreased neural activity in the co-cultures, with EV-D68 A2/2018 inducing the most rapid and robust negative effect on neural co-cultures, followed by EV-D68 B3/2019. EV-D68 strains preferentially infected neurons, whereas EV-A71 infection was detected in both cell types to the same extent. Despite the lack of viral release of infectious virus particles of EV-D68 B3/2019 in the supernatant, the infection could spread in the cultures and reduce neurotransmission. Higher viral load and broader tropism of EV-A71 did not result in enhanced impairment of neural function. Our results demonstrate that neurotropic non-polio enteroviruses lead to disruption of spontaneous neural activity in a virus-specific manner, which does not correlate with their replication efficiency.","[{""name"":""ZonMw, The Dutch Organisation for knowledge and innovation in health, healthcare and well-being"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01yaj9a77"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VENI contract 09150162210154;OffRoad grant Nr. 04510012210010;""},{""name"":""Dutch Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04jsz6e67"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""VI.Veni.222.092;VIDI contract 91718308;Gravitation project (024.003.001;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305727

The relevant Notch1-DLL-4 and 4{beta}1-integrin-VCAM-1 interactions are known to respond to mechanical forces that regulate their bond dissociation behaviors and downstream signal transduction, yet manipulating the mechanosensitive features of these key receptor-ligand interactions in thymopoiesis has been largely ignored in current ETN designs. Here, we demonstrate that human T-cell development from cord blood-derived CD34+ HSCs is regulated via molecular cooperativity in notch1 and integrin-mediated mechanotransduction. Mechanically confining interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogel-based 3D cell culture comprised of collagen type I and alginate polysaccharides functionalized with DLL-4 and VCAM-1 is used as a model viscoelastic 3D ETN to manipulate human progenitor (pro)T-cell differentiation. This ETN enables orthogonal control of the mechanical and biomolecular features of the thymic niche, including thymopoietic ligand density, modulus, and viscoelastic properties (e.g., stress relaxation kinetics). We identify that soft, viscous matrices that enhance activation of the notch1-pathway, and subsequently notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) nuclear import sustain the T-cell development gene regulatory network during proT-cell differentiation. Conversely, stiff, elastic matrices inhibit HSC commitment to the T-lineage, and rather promotes Myeloid-cell differentiation. Our observations indicate mechanical reciprocity in signaling pathways indispensable to thymopoiesis, and highlights extracellular matrix mechanics as a variable in controlling hematopoietic stem cell fate decisions.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305727

This raises the possibility that they produce a convergent effect on the dynamics or temporal evolution of neural population activity. To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.","[{""name"":""Office of Naval Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/00rk2pe57"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""MURI N00014-23-1-2768;MURI W911NF2410228;""},{""name"":""National Institute of Mental Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/04xeg9z08"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R01MH131715-01;R01MH11559;""},{""name"":""National Institutes of Health"",""id"":""https://ror.org/01cwqze88"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""1R21AG077275-01A1;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305727

As the encoded function eventually promotes DNA self-replication, the gene variants with greater activity are selected. Using different coupling mechanisms, we demonstrate ACS of three functions: transcription, synthesis of a deoxynucleoside triphosphate for DNA replication, and {beta}-galactosidase activity. The latter example illustrates how a function that is unrelated to the Central Dogma can be selected.

Here, we introduce a novel theoretical framework in which the organ, described as a set of connected, concentric morphoelastic cylindrical shells representing distinct tissues, grows axially in response to its local elastic strain. This approach allows to formulate analytical expressions relating tissue-level differences in elasticity and intrinsic growth to macroscopic characteristics such as organ axial growth rates, bending motions, and residual stress profiles. To demonstrate the framework, we analyze a minimal two-layer model representing the epidermis and inner tissues, and use it to explore the ""epidermal growth control"" hypothesis, which posits that the epidermis regulates expansion by mechanically limiting inner tissue elongation.

Key unanswered questions include whether cortical areas are fully established near birth, the extent of individual variation in the arrangement of cortical areas, and whether any such individual variation in cortical area location is greater in later-developing association areas as compared to earlier-developing sensorimotor areas. To address these questions, we used functional MRI to collect precision functional mapping (PFM) data in eight individual neonates (mean 42.7 weeks postmenstrual age) over 2-5 days (mean 77.9 minutes of low motion data per subject [framewise displacement <0.1]). Each subjects dataset was split into two roughly equal halves of data from different days of data collection to measure within-subject reliability and across-subject similarity. Whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (FC) reached a mean within-subject, across-day reliability of r=0.78 with 41.9 minutes of data. Across subject similarity of whole-brain FC was r=0.62 on average and significantly lower than within-subject similarity (t=5.9, p<0.001). Using established methods to identify transitions in FC across the cortical surface, we identified sets of cortical areas for each individual that were subject-specific and highly reliable across split-halves (mean z=4.4, SD=1.4). The arrangement of cortical areas was thus individually specific across the entire cortical surface, and this individual specificity did not vary as a function of the sensorimotor-association axis. This study establishes the feasibility of neonatal PFM and suggests that cortical area arrangement is individually specific and largely established shortly following birth.

Interfacial tension is a key determinant of biomolecular condensate behavior, influencing condensate size and interactions with intracellular structures. Certain proteins and RNAs are known to selectively localize to the interface of condensates, where they can regulate condensate function in cells. Previously, we designed amphiphilic proteins that preferentially adsorb to the surface of condensates. These proteins contain one phase-separating domain (RGG) and one non-phase-separating domain (MBP or GST). Here, we demonstrate through direct quantification that these amphiphilic proteins act as surfactants, reducing the interfacial tension of RGG-RGG condensates from [~]260 {micro}N/m to [~]100 {micro}N/m in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, the GST-based surfactant protein exhibits a 10-fold greater efficacy in lowering interfacial tension compared to the MBP-based surfactant. We show that this increased efficacy is due to its higher surface density, driven by GSTs ability to oligomerize. We also show that these surfactant proteins slow droplet fusion and reduce average droplet size, as would be expected of a typical surfactant. Our findings quantitatively show how surfactant proteins can play a critical role in regulating the behavior of biomolecular condensates by modulating their interfacial tension.

Toxic strains isolated in Latin America produce saxitoxins (STXs), which are neurotoxins that block voltage-gated ion channels in cells. This cyanobacterium can exert allelopathic effects on other phytoplankton species in response to resource competition through the secretion of substances that impair the target-cell physiology. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) constitute a secretion system that can transport biologically active molecules to distant targets in a protected, concentrated and targeted way. However, the role of EVs in cyanobacterial biology is poorly understood. We aimed to characterize R. raciborskii EVs and test whether this extracellular fraction or other exudate fractions contribute to its allelopathic effect. Exudates from two STX-producing R. raciborskii strains (T3 and CY-10) were subjected to filtration and divided into vesicular fractions (VF, >100 kDa, with EVs), which were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and dissolved fractions (DF, <100 kDa, no EVs). Characterization of the VF through nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy revealed spheric structures with diameters of 100-200 nm. Ratios of the number of EVs/cell were estimated as 21.54 {+/-} 1.33 for T3 and 8.79 {+/-} 0.38 for CY-10. The STX content of exudate fractions was determined by ELISA. Total extracellular STX concentrations (STX + neosaxitoxin (neoSTX)) were 170.64 ({+/-}15.43) pg.mL-1 for T3 and 913.84 ({+/-}226.87) pg.mL-1 for CY-10 and these values were similar to those of the DF (<100 kDa fraction). In the VF, STX concentrations were approximately 103-10 times lower. The estimation of toxin quotas (per biovolume) resulted in values 20-40 times lower in EVs (0.27{+/-}0,09 ng.mm-3 for T3 and 1.81{+/-}0.49 ng.mm-3 for CY-10) than in cells (13.05 {+/-}2.16 ng.mm-3 for T3 and 33.65 {+/-}7.31 ng.mm-3 for CY-10). A shift in the predominant analog between compartments was observed, with neoSTX prevailing in cells and STX in EVs. The CY-10 strain exhibited higher toxin concentrations than T3 in the VF, DF, total extracellular fraction and cellular fraction. The allelopathic effect of R. raciborskii exudate fractions was tested on the green algae Monoraphidium capricornutum. The total extracellular fraction and the DF equally inhibited M. capricornutum growth and photosynthesis, but the VF had no effect. Thus, the effect can be attributed to dissolved allelopathic compounds <100 kDa. These results open new opportunities to further investigate the role of EVs in the ecophysiology of R. raciborskii.

Yet, functional annotation of the bovine genome remains limited, hindering our ability to unravel the mechanisms underpinning complex traits of economic and ecological importance in cattle. Here, we present a comprehensive epigenetic atlas comprising 1,147 genome-wide epigenetic profiles, including chromatin accessibility, six histone modifications, CTCF transcription factor binding sites, DNA methylation, chromatin conformation, and transcriptomes across 53 adult tissues, 6 fetal tissues, and 7 primary cell types. This atlas covers 99.8% of the bovine genome with at least one epigenomic feature, and annotates 45% of the genome as putative regulatory elements exhibiting tissue- or cell-specific regulatory activity. Leveraging sequence-to-function deep learning models, we discovered 301 sequence motifs and predicted the functional impact of genetic variants through in silico mutagenesis, thereby facilitating the decoding of the regulatory syntax of the cattle genome and fine-mapping of GWAS loci for 22 complex traits. Cross-species analysis further revealed evolutionarily conserved features of regulatory architecture and provided evolutionary insights into complex traits and diseases in humans. Together, this atlas offers a foundational resource for advancing cattle functional genomics, sustainable breeding, and studies of regulatory evolution.","[{""name"":""USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2018-67015-27500;2015-67015-22940;""},{""name"":""Foundation to Support the Research of São Paulo State"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""2020/01369-1;2022/12631-4;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305728

This has resulted in the accumulation of studies estimating the age-specific demographic transition rates across the tree of life over the last few decades. Although this accumulation of studies has enabled comparative demographic analyses to be developed, such analyses remain difficult to perform because age-specific data are scattered across literature. Here, we present a new open-access database, malddaba, which compiles age-specific demographic rates for mammals in the wild from published information. Currently, the database encompasses 170 species from 250 publications, representing 428 age- and sex-specific survival series and 199 age- and sex-specific reproduction series. Each series is reported using a standardized approach aimed at facilitating the extraction and use of that dataset by anyone interested in comparative biology. We show how malddaba can be used to address a variety of questions, ranging from comparative ageing with the assessment of actuarial and reproductive senescence patterns in a wide diversity of mammals. We can also address questions related to comparative population dynamics. For this purpose, in addition to the raw demographic rate records, we were able to build 43 population-specific life tables using malddaba records, which allow demographic outputs to be estimated accurately, such as population growth rate and generation time for those species. The malddaba database will be regularly updated to keep adding new demographic estimates and bring a comprehensive and dynamic view of the diversity of demographic trajectories across mammals.","[{""name"":""Agence National de la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR JCJC “AGEX” (ANR-15-CE32-0002-01);ANR PRC “DivInT” (ANR-22-CE02-0020);ANR PRC “EVORA” (ANR-22-CE02-0021);""},{""name"":""Alexander von Humboldt Foundation"",""id"":""https://ror.org/012kf4317"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305728

Costs constrain the amount of biological insight obtainable within a given budget, and as sequencing prices decline, efficient library protocols have become a decisive factor. In this study, we introduce an approach to systematically optimize the number of usable reads that RNA-seq protocols generate. We applied this ""funnel strategy"" to prime-seq, an early-barcoding bulk RNA-seq protocol, by systematically testing critical protocol steps totaling 1080 samples in 49 libraries. This resulted in the optimized prime-seq2 protocol that increases the number of usable reads by 60 % and improves one of the most cost-efficient bulk RNA-seq protocols available. Our study also suggests that monitoring the filtering of usable reads can serve as a valuable quality control for many RNA-seq protocols and sheds light on the complexity of the conditions and interactions that shape RNA-seq library composition and their interpretation.

Based on the number of formants, two different coda quality categories have been described: a-codas and i-codas. In the present paper, we demonstrate that sperm whale codas not only resemble human vowels acoustically, but also pattern like them across several dimensions. First, traditional count- and timing-based coda types interact with coda ""vowel"" quality (a vs. i). Second, a-codas are generally longer than i-codas. Third, the duration of i-codas has a bimodal distribution, showing a contrast between short i-codas and long[i] -codas. Fourth, the baseline coda length differs across whales. And fifth, edge clicks mismatching their coda often match an adjacent coda, a phenomenon that resembles human coarticulation. All five properties have close parallels in the phonetics and phonology of human languages. Sperm whale coda vocalizations thus represent one of the closest parallels to human phonology of any known animal communication system.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSperm whales communicate using series of clicks known as codas. The codas acoustically resemble human vowels. In addition, they pattern in ways similar to human sound systems. For example, different coda types are correlated with particular click qualities, and their durations are intentionally controlled. This shows that sperm whale vocalizations are highly complex and likely constitute one of the most sophisticated communication systems in the animal kingdom. By studying it, we may be able to gain a broader understanding of animal intelligence and social behaviors, determine the impact of human activities on whale habitat, develop strategies to protect whales from threats such as noise pollution and ship traffic, and advance legislation which facilitates that protection.","NA","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305728

Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically.

Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

Despite their critical role, the structural organization of kinetochores assembled on centromeres with vastly distinct architectures across diverse species remains poorly understood2,3. To address this question, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the inner kinetochore (CCAN) from the silkmoth Bombyx mori, an insect that lacks the canonical centromere-specifying histone variant CENP-A and exhibits chromosome-wide centromeric activity (holocentric). Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex. Our work establishes this self-contained CCAN dimer as a key structural unit that forms the basis of a holocentric organization and suggests that large-scale centromere architectures can emerge from the modular arrangement of such discrete kinetochore units.","[{""name"":""The LabEx DEEP"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""ANR-11-LABX-0044;""},{""name"":""Institut Curie ATIP-AVENIR Research grant"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""Fondation Schlumberger pour l’Education et la Recherche"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""FSER202202015420;""},{""name"":""European Research Council"",""id"":""https://ror.org/0472cxd90"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""CENEVO-758757;""},{""name"":""French National Centre for Scientific Research"",""id"":""https://ror.org/02feahw73"",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""""},{""name"":""EMBO LTF"",""id"":"""",""id-type"":""ROR"",""award"":""505-2021;""}]","NA","bioRxiv",1756505305728

Here, we connect cell state dynamics of type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2) in cholangitis with site-specific{gamma}{delta} T17 responses in liver and draining lymph nodes (LN).

MethodsThe 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and{gamma}{delta} T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and{gamma}{delta} T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice.

ResultsA disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17-inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors.{gamma}{delta} T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity. Spatial proximity and conserved molecular interactions of cDC2 and{gamma}{delta} T cells were confirmed in human cholangitis. Il17-deficiency resulted in reduced liver fibrosis in mice, while cDC2B depletion attenuated{gamma}{delta} T17 cell states.

ConclusionsIn cholangitis, a profibrogenic function of{gamma}{delta} T cells is contingent on the induction by peribiliary cDC2B, thereby highlighting relevant disease determinants within the immunobiliary and liver-draining LN niche.

Impact and ImplicationsThe immunobiliary niche contains rare immune cells such as conventional dendritic cells and unconventional T cells, however, the function of these cell types in liver inflammation remains poorly understood. Mirroring human biliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, we induced experimental cholangitis in a mouse model to generate a site-specific single-cell sequencing atlas resource resolving underexplored cell populations. Our data capture a profibrotic hepatic disease state trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B inducing a{gamma}{delta} T cell-specific Il17-response, which is attenuated upon cDC2B depletion and in DC precursors, which are characterized by reduced genomic accessibility of{gamma}{delta} T cell-interacting genes.

These results highlight the importance of portal niche residing underexplored immune cell populations and the necessity to further resolve immunobiliary niche responses and crosstalk in inflammatory settings such as in cholangitis.
