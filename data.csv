Most organisms have a life cycle with unicellular bottlenecks during reproduction. However, some organisms like plants, fungi, or colonial animals can grow indefinitely, changing the manner in which mutations spread throughout both the individual and the population. Furthermore, clonally reproducing organisms may also achieve exceedingly long lifespans, making somatic mutation an important mechanism of creating heritable variation for Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Yet, little is known about intra-organism mutation rates and evolutionary trajectories in long-lived species. Here, we study the Pando aspen clone, the largest known quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) clone founded by a single seedling and thought to be one of the oldest studied organisms. Aspen reproduce vegetatively via new root-borne stems forming clonal patches, sometimes spanning several hectares. To study the evolutionary history of the Pando clone, we collected and sequenced over 500 samples from Pando and neighboring clones, as well as from various tissue types within Pando, including leaves, roots, and bark. We applied a series of filters to distinguish somatic mutations from the pool of both somatic and germline mutations, incorporating a technical replicate sequencing approach to account for uncertainty in somatic mutation detection. Despite root spreading being spatially constrained, we observed only a modest positive correlation between genetic and spatial distance, suggesting the presence of a mechanism preventing the accumulation and spread of mutations across units. Phylogenetic models estimate the age of the clone to between ~16,000-80,000 years. This age is generally corroborated by the near-continuous presence of aspen pollen in a lake sediment record collected from Fish Lake near Pando. Overall, this work enhances understanding of mutation accumulation and dispersal within and between ramets of long-lived, clonally-reproducing organisms.

Significance StatementThis study enhances our understanding of evolutionary processes in long-lived clonal organisms by investigating somatic mutation accumulation and dispersal patterns within the iconic Pando aspen clone. The authors estimated the clone to be between 10,000 and 80,000 years old and uncovered a modest spatial genetic structure in the 42.6-hectare clone, suggesting localized mutation build-up rather than dispersal along tissue lineages. This work sheds light on an ancient organism and how plants may evolve to preserve genetic integrity in meristems fueling indefinite growth, with implications for our comprehension of adaptive strategies in long-lived perennials.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

Here, we construct a consensus variant-to-function (cV2F) score that assigns a single value to each common single-nucleotide variant in the genome, and helps to predict and characterize causal disease variants. The cV2F score leverages features reflecting variant-level experimentally and computationally predicted function (e.g. allelic imbalance and sequence-based deep learning models) and element-level function (e.g. predicted enhancers), and learns optimal combinations of features by training a gradient boosting model on GWAS fine-mapping results. The cV2F-annotated variants attained an AUPRC of 0.822 at identifying held-out fine-mapped variants. Variants with high cV2F scores are highly enriched for heritability (14.2x, s.e. 0.5) across 66 diseases/traits, are uniquely informative for disease heritability, and are highly predictive of variants implicated by reporter assays; cV2F substantially outperforms previous variant-to-function scores using all of these metrics. GWAS fine-mapping of 110 diseases/traits informed by cV2F identified 14.3% more confidently fine-mapped (PIP > 0.95) variants than non-functionally informed fine-mapping. We further constructed tissue/cell line-specific cV2F scores that prioritize variants based on regulatory potential in specific tissues/cell lines, attaining high heritability enrichment for tissue-related diseases/traits (15.6x, s.e. 2.3) while providing independent information (average correlation of 0.27 with the primary cV2F score). We highlight examples of GWAS loci for which cV2F pinpoints causal variants with high confidence and elucidates their functional role.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

However, data on the type of antibiotics prescribed for such infections is only available for children <5 years in the UK. Understanding the contribution of RSV to antibiotic prescribing would facilitate predicting the impact of RSV preventative measures on antibiotic use and resistance.

ObjectivesTo estimate the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions in English general practice attributable to RSV by age and antibiotic class.

MethodsGeneralised additive models examined associations between weekly counts of general practice antibiotic prescriptions and laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections from 2015 to 2018, adjusting for temperature, practice holidays and remaining seasonal confounders. We used general practice records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and microbiology tests for RSV, influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, human Metapneumovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae from Englands Second Generation Surveillance System.

ResultsAn estimated 2.1% of antibiotics were attributable to RSV, equating to an average of 640,000 prescriptions annually. Of these, adults [&ge;]75 years contributed to the greatest volume, with an annual average of 149,078 (95% credible interval: 93,733-206,045). Infants 6-23 months had the highest average annual rate at 6,580 prescriptions per 100,000 individuals (95% credible interval: 4,522-8,651). Most RSV-attributable antibiotic prescriptions were penicillins, macrolides or tetracyclines. Adults [&ge;]65 years had a wider range of antibiotic classes associated with RSV compared to younger age groups.

ConclusionsInterventions to reduce the burden of RSV, particularly in older adults, could complement current strategies to reduce antibiotic use in England.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955366

We discovered that bacteria can overcome this limitation by acquiring nutrients through lysing neighboring cells via contact-dependent antagonism. Using single-cell live imaging and isotopic markers, we found that during starvation the type VI secretion system, which transfers toxins into neighboring cells, increases growth by enabling the uptake of nutrients from lysing cells. In a spatially structured environment, the gradual lysis of just a few target cells allows for the growth of a new antagonist cell. Genomic adaptations in antagonists, characterized by a reduced metabolic gene repertoire, and the prevalence of the type VI secretion system in natural environments, such as global oceans and soils, suggest that bacterial antagonism has the potential to substantially contribute to nutrient transfer within microbial communities across various ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

Prior studies have focused mainly on the pre-Omicron period or only on specific regions, lack crucial life-year calculations, and often depend on strong modeling assumptions with unaccounted uncertainty. We aimed to calculate the lives and life-years saved by COVID-19 vaccination worldwide from the onset of the vaccination campaigns and until October 2024. We considered different strata according to age; community-dwelling and long-term care residence status; pre-Omicron and Omicron periods; and vaccination before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the main analysis, 2.533 million deaths were averted. Eighty-two percent were among people vaccinated before any infection, 57% were in the Omicron period, and 90% pertained to people 60 years and above. Sensitivity analyses suggested 1.4 to 4.0 million lives saved. Some sensitivity analyses showed preponderance of the benefit during the pre-Omicron period. We estimated 14.8 million life-years saved (sensitivity range, 7.4-23.6 million life-years). Most life-years saved (76%) were in people over 60 years old, but long-term care residents contributed only 2% of the total. Children and adolescents (0.01% of lives saved and 0.1% of life-years saved) and young adults 20-29 years old (0.07% of lives saved and 0.3% of life-years saved) had very small contributions to the total benefit. Based on a number of assumptions, these estimates are substantially more conservative than previous calculations focusing mostly on the first year of vaccination, but they still undeniably demonstrate a major overall benefit from COVID-19 vaccination during 2020-2024. The vast majority of benefit in lives and life-years saved was secured for a portion of the elderly minority of the global population.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955366

Using CRISPR-Cas9 and CRISPR-Cas13d systems, we functionally dissected the contribution of maternal versus zygotic fractions and overcame challenges of studying embryonic lethal genes. We identified differentially distributed maternal mRNAs in specific cells and evidenced the critical role of five maternal mRNAs, cth1, arl4d, abi1b, foxa and lhx1a, in embryogenesis. Further, we focused on the functionally uncharacterized cth1 gene, revealing its essential role in gametogenesis and embryogenesis. Cth1 acts as a spatio-temporal RNA decay factor regulating mRNA stability and accumulation of its targets in a spatio-temporal manner through 3'UTR recognition during early development. Furthermore, Cth1 3'UTR drives its spatio-temporal RNA localization. Our findings provide new insights into spatio-temporal RNA decay mechanisms and highlight dual CRISPR-Cas strategies in studying embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages, viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage's benefit 1-5. One such gene is nblA which is present in multiple cyanophage families 2, 6-9. Under nutrient deprivation the cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome 10-12, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks 12, serving as a survival mechanism 13. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation 9,7,6. However, the benefit of the cyanophage-encoded NblA for the cyanophage and the broader impact on the host are unknown. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for cyanophages 14, we reveal that cyanophage NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other photosynthetic proteins and reduces host photosynthetic light harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and compose 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in the surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of the nblA gene to the cyanophage while exerting a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that nblA-encoding cyanophages have a global effect on the amount of light harvested by oceanic picocyanobacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

Here, we demonstrate that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the external lateral subdivision of the parabrachial nucleus (CGRPPBel) encode opposing valence via differential release, rather than co-release, of glutamate and neuropeptides, according to firing rate. Glutamate is released preferentially at lower firing rates with minimal release at higher firing rates, whereas neuropeptides are released at higher firing rates, resulting in frequency-dependent switching of transmitters. Aversive stimuli evoke high frequency responses with accompanying neuropeptide release to encode negative valence, whereas appetitive stimuli evoke low frequency responses with glutamate release to encode positive valence. Our study reveals a previously unknown capability of single CGRPPBel neurons to bidirectionally encode valence via frequency-dependent differential release of transmitters in vivo.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

However, the relatively low representation of admixed populations in both discovery and fine-tuning individual-level datasets limits PRS development for admixed populations. Under the assumption that the most informative PRS weight for a homogeneous sample, which can be approximated by a data point in the ancestry continuum space, varies linearly in that space, we introduce a Genetic Distance-assisted PRS Combination Pipeline for Diverse Genetic Ancestries (DiscoDivas) to interpolate a harmonized PRS for diverse, especially admixed, ancestries, leveraging multiple PRS weights fine-tuned within single-ancestry samples and the genetic ancestry continuum information. DiscoDivas treats ancestry as a continuous variable and does not require shifting between different models when calculating PRS for different ancestries. We generated PRS with DiscoDivas and the current conventional method, i.e. fine-tuning multiple GWAS PRS using the matched or similar ancestry sample, for simulated datasets and large-scale biobank datasets (UK Biobank [UKBB] N=415,402, Mass General Brigham Biobank N=53,306, All of Us N=245,394) and compared our method with the conventional method with quantitative traits and complex disease traits. DiscoDivas generated a harmonized PRS of the accuracy comparable to or higher than the conventional approach, with the greatest advantage exhibited in admixed samples: DiscoDivas PRS for admixed samples was more statistically accurate than the PRS fine-tuned in matched or similar ancestry sample in 12 out of 16 simulated scenarios and was statistically equivalent in the remaining four scenarios; when tested with quantitative trait data in UKBB, DiscoDivas increased the PRS accuracy of admixed sample by 5% on average; yet no statistical difference was observed when tested for binary traits in UKBB where ancestry-matched data was available. For the single ancestry samples, the accuracy of DiscoDivas PRS and PRS fine-tuned in match samples was similar. In summary, our method DiscoDivas yields a harmonized PRS of robust accuracy for individuals across the genetic ancestry spectrum, including where ancestry-matched training data may be incomplete.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955366

We showcase the applicability of ePytope-TCR by evaluating the performance of the prediction methods on two challenging datasets for annotating single-cell repertoires and predicting TCR cross-reactivity towards mutated epitopes. While novel predictors successfully predicted binding to frequently observed epitopes, all methods failed for less observed epitopes. Further, we detected a strong bias in the prediction scores between different epitope classes. We envision this benchmark to guide researchers in their choice of a predictor for a given setting.

To gain deeper insights into the etiology of different brain diseases, we used specimens from 1,494 unique donors to generate a population-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), comprising over 6.3 million individual nuclei. The cohort includes neurotypical controls as well as donors affected by eight common and complex brain disorders: Alzheimers disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinsons disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We show that inter-individual variation accounts for a substantial portion of gene expression variation in the DLPFC. By comparing transcriptomic variation across diseases, we reveal universal signatures enriched in basic cellular functions such as mRNA splicing and protein localization. After discounting these cross-disease signatures, we show strong genetic and transcriptomic concordance among AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD, largely driven by alteration of synaptic signaling functions in neurons. Furthermore, we characterize transcriptomic variation among different AD phenotypes that were distinct from healthy aging. We uncover mitigating effects of interneurons and aggravating effects of immune and vascular cells in AD dementia. Further exploring the effect of the neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently accompanying AD, we identify a link to deep layer excitatory neurons. By constructing transcriptome trajectories that capture AD progression, we show cell-type specific responses implicated in early and late stages of AD.

Extensive studies have generated molecular profiles at both bulk and single-cell levels; however, systematic integration that describes tissue-wide changes as a function of cell type coordination remains challenging. This disconnect hampers our understanding of the complex multicellular interactions driving heart failure, limiting our ability to translate molecular insights into actionable therapeutic strategies. Here, we integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptional profiles from cardiac tissues of HF and control patients across 25 studies, covering 1,524 individuals and seven cell-types, to delineate consensus multicellular transcriptional changes associated with cardiac remodeling. Our analyses revealed conserved cellular coordination events involving fibrotic, metabolic, inflammatory, and hypertrophic mechanisms, with fibroblasts playing a central role in predicting cardiomyocyte stress. Further analysis of fibroblast populations suggested that their activation in HF represents a broad phenotypic shift rather than solely accumulating distinct cell states. The integration of bulk and single-cell data within our data collection indicated that transcriptional responses to HF across cell types occur independently of tissue composition. Mapping independent data into our consensus programs demonstrated that recovery after left ventricular assist device implantation aligns with molecular recovery, highlighting the clinical relevance of the multicellular molecular state. Overall, our work synthesizes independent cardiac transcriptomics studies and makes the conserved HF associated insights available, establishing a reference for detailed exploration of HF-related multicellular molecular events.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

While the genes for diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP hydrolases (active or mutated) can be easily identified in microbial genomes, the list of c-di-GMP receptor domains is quite limited, and only two of them, PliZ and MshEN, are found across multiple bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor protein, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate their cell size and, more recently, natural competence. Sequence and structural analysis indicated that CdgR is part of a widespread ComFB protein family, named after the late competence development protein ComFB from Bacillus subtilis. This prompted the suggestion that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also be c-di-GMP receptors. Indeed, we revealed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive B. subtilis and Thermoanaerobacter brockii were able to bind c-di-GMP with high-affinity. The ability to bind c-di-GMP was also demonstrated for the ComFB proteins from clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae and Treponema denticola. These observations indicate that the ComFB family serves as yet another widespread family of bacterial c-di-GMP receptors. Incidentally, some ComFB proteins were also capable of c-di-AMP binding, identifying them as a unique family of c-di-NMP receptor proteins. The overexpression of comFB in B. subtilis, combined with an elevated concentration of c-di-GMP, suppressed motility, attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1 in our study. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

Streptococci are common in animal microbiota and include opportunistic pathogens like Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). While the conserved streptococcal S protein has been identified as a key factor in GAS virulence, its exact function is unclear. Here, we show that the pneumococcal S protein is crucial for resisting against host-derived antimicrobials by coordinating cell wall modification and repair. Specifically, we show that S proteins are septally localized through their transmembrane domain and contain an extracellular peptidoglycan (PG) binding LysM domain which is required for its function. Protein-protein and genetic interaction studies demonstrate that the pneumococcal S protein directly interacts with a PG synthase, class A penicillin binding protein PBP1a, and the PG deacetylase PgdA. Single-molecule experiments reveal that the fraction of circumferentially moving PBP1a molecules is reduced in the absence of S protein. Consistent with an impaired PBP1a function, streptococci lacking S protein exhibit increased susceptibility to cell wall targeting antibiotics and altered cell morphologies. PG analysis showed reduced N-deacetylation of glycans in the S. pneumoniae S protein mutant, indicating reduced PgdA activity. We show that pneumococci lacking the S protein cannot persist transient penicillin treatment, are more susceptible to the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and to lysozyme, and show decreased virulence in zebrafish and mice. Our data support a model in which S proteins regulate PBP1a activity and play a key role in coordinating PG repair and modification. This cell wall sentinel control system provides defense against host-derived and environmental antimicrobial attack.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

To understand the seeming paradox of how sequence variability is compatible with persistent function, we examined the functional determinants for a poorly conserved but essential IDR. We show that IDR function depends on two distinct but related properties: sequence- and chemical specificity. While sequence-specificity works via linear binding motifs, chemical specificity reflects the sequence-encoded chemistry of multivalent interactions through amino acids across an IDR. Unexpectedly, a binding motif that is essential in the wild-type IDR can be removed if compensatory changes to the sequence chemistry are made, highlighting the orthogonality and interoperability of both properties and providing a much deeper sequence space compatible with function. Our results provide a general framework to understand the functional constraints on IDR sequence evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

Genetic loss of either LUBAC or OTULIN causes autoinflammatory syndromes, which are associated with defects in glycogen and lipid metabolism. However, how LUBAC and OTULIN regulate metabolic signalling remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that LUBAC promotes, while OTULIN restricts, activation of the key metabolic regulator AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in cells, mice, and human samples. LUBAC and OTULIN interact with AMPK, control its M1-ubiquitination, and regulate its activation in response to glucose starvation and allosteric activation. During starvation, LUBAC deficiency impairs autophagy induction and hinders the shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Strikingly, LUBAC-deficient Drosophila have a strongly reduced survival rate after starvation. Our work identifies LUBAC and OTULIN as physiological regulators of AMPK, providing the first mechanism by which M1-linked ubiquitin chains regulate metabolic signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955366

Here, we establish a platform for in vivo imaging of primary cell therapies using ultrasound - a ubiquitously accessible technology for high-resolution non-invasive imaging. We introduce and optimize a lentiviral delivery system to express acoustic reporter genes based on gas vesicles in primary mammalian cells such as T cells, showing that this results in robust ultrasound contrast. Additionally, we develop genetic circuits making it possible to monitor T cell activation via activity-dependent promoters. We apply this technology to primary human T cells, using it to non-invasively track their accumulation and proliferation as a targeted therapy in a mouse tumor xenograft model and compare it to invasive, terminal measures such as immunohistology. By making it possible to visualize cell-based therapies and their function inside opaque living organs with unprecedented resolution and accessibility, this technology has the potential to significantly accelerate their development and effective use.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a humanised knock-in mouse model bearing the homozygous Glp1r A316T substitution. Human Glp1r A316T/A316T mice displayed lower fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance, as well as increased plasma insulin levels and improved insulin secretion compared to human Glp1r +/+ littermates, even under metabolic stress. They also exhibited alterations in islet cytoarchitecture and {beta}-cell identity under a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet.

Here, using marine bacterial isolates, we detected energy transfer from a carotenoid (myxol) to retinal not only in proteorhodopsin but also in the chloride ion-pumping rhodopsin.

Using task-based (i.e., attention to-be-remembered visual stimuli) and task-free (resting-state) data from 101 children and adults (5.93 - 54.00 years, 63 males; n electrodes = 5691), we mapped aperiodic (1/f-like) activity, a proxy of excitation:inhibition (E:I) balance with steeper slopes indexing inhibition and flatter slopes indexing excitation. We reveal that aperiodic slopes flatten with age into young adulthood in both association and sensorimotor cortices, challenging models of early sensorimotor development based on brain structure. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), attentional state modulated age effects, revealing steeper task-based than task-free slopes in adults and the opposite in children, consistent with the development of cognitive control. Age-related differences in task-based slopes also explained age-related gains in memory performance, linking the development of PFC cognitive control to the development of memory. Last, with additional structural imaging measures, we reveal that age-related differences in gray matter volume are differentially associated with aperiodic slopes in association and sensorimotor cortices.

We examined three cohorts of university students (N=584) and used non-parametric methods to assess correlations of various health and cognitive variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, time since infection, time since vaccination, and virus variants.

The analysis also revealed that individuals who contracted COVID-19 after vaccination had better health and cognitive outcomes compared to those infected before vaccination. The study also discusses some limitations inherent in cross-sectional studies, particularly those arising from the stronger tendency of individuals with poorer health, compared to healthier individuals, to avoid infection and prioritize vaccination.

Previous research employing functional MRI (fMRI) in humans has identified cortical organizing principles that allow not only for coarse-scale distinctions such as animate versus inanimate objects but also more fine-grained distinctions at the level of individual objects. This suggests that fMRI carries rather fine-grained information about individual objects. However, most previous work investigating fine-grained category representations either additionally included coarse-scale category comparisons of objects, which confounds fine-grained and coarse-scale distinctions, or only used a single exemplar of each object, which confounds visual and semantic information. To address these challenges, here we used multisession human fMRI (female and male) paired with a broad yet homogenous stimulus class of 48 terrestrial mammals, with 2 exemplars per mammal. Multivariate decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) revealed high image-specific reliability in low- and high-level visual regions, indicating stable representational patterns at the image level. In contrast, analyses across exemplars of the same animal yielded only small effects in the lateral occipital complex (LOC), indicating rather subtle category effects in this region. Variance partitioning with a deep neural network and shape model showed that across exemplar effects in EVC were largely explained by low-level visual appearance, while representations in LOC appeared to also contain higher category-specific information. These results suggest that representations typically measured with fMRI are dominated by image-specific visual or coarse-grained category information but indicate that commonly employed fMRI protocols may reveal subtle yet reliable distinctions between individual objects.

Significance StatementWhile it has been suggested that functional MRI (fMRI) responses in ventral visual cortex carry fine-grained information about individual objects, much previous research has confounded fine-grained with coarse-scale category information or only used individual visual exemplars, which potentially confounds semantic and visual object information. Here we address these challenges in a multisession fMRI study where participants viewed a highly homogenous stimulus set of 48 land mammals with 2 exemplars per animal. Our results reveal a strong dominance of image-specific effects and additionally indicate subtle yet reliable category-specific effects in lateral occipital complex, underscoring the capacity of commonly employed fMRI protocols to uncover fine-grained visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

However, a trade-off between spatial resolution, speed, photodamage, and setup complexity limits its implementation. Here, we designed and built a single objective light sheet microscope, customized for in vivo imaging of adult flies and optimized for maximum resolution. Unlike multi-objective light sheet setups, the microscope uses a single objective at the fly head interface, facilitating sample mounting and inspection, and reducing invasiveness. In contrast to two-photon microscopies, the light-sheet configuration with visible excitation offers reduced phototoxicity. We demonstrate in vivo imaging of the membrane, mitochondria, and dense-core vesicles in the axonal projections of small lateral ventral neurons. The achieved resolution was between 380 to 500 nm within a field of view of 70x50x12 m3. This unique combination of easy sample mounting, high resolution, and the low-phototoxicity of light sheet illumination paves the way for new dynamic studies in the brain of living flies.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

One major family of proteins catalysing this reaction are the acyl transferase family 3 (AT3) proteins, which form a pore to allow acyl-CoA to penetrate the membrane for transfer onto an extracytosolic acceptor molecule. Recent structures of the sequence-unrelated human heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT) support a similar transmembrane acyl-group transfer mechanism. Here we demonstrate that both protein families contain a conserved 10-transmembrane helical fold with high structural and detectable sequence conservation around the acyl-CoA pore, supporting the previously proposed Transmembrane Acyl Transferase (TmAT) protein superfamily. In addition, we identify TmAT proteins, including the human Golgi sialate-O-acetyltransferase (CASD1), the human/fungal PIG-W/GWT1 enzymes and the bacterial vancomycin resistance protein VanTG, where the TmAT domain's function has been largely unrecognised. We conclude that the TmAT fold represents an ancient architecture for transmembrane acyl-group transfer with important roles in the dynamic modification of glycans in diverse processes across the three domains of life.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

Advanced spatial transcriptomics has enabled biologists to break new ground in studies of molecular dynamics and cellular patterning during embryonic development with spatiotemporal resolution.

However, a crucial phase for early organogenesis between E9.5 and E11.5 was deficient. To unveil the mystery of this stage, we present the 3D transcriptomics of mouse embryos at E9.5 and E11.5, with a widely applicable reconstruction workflow that bypasses sophisticated bioinformatic calculations. As our 3D atlas is generated at single-cell resolution, we demonstrate how organogenetic processes can be interpreted at different levels of granularity, from local cellular interactions to whole embryonic regionalization.

However, the organization of arousal and memory reactivation markers within the human ISFS and its conservation in younger ages remain unclear. This study characterizes the ISFS from childhood to young adulthood (N = 154; ages 8-26), examining its relationship with functional markers. Results indicate that the ISFS is present across all ages, with frequency, variability, and strength increasing from early to late adolescence. Notably, markers of arousal and memory reactivation are organized within the spindle-rich ISFS peak. The consistent presence and organization of the ISFS suggest it is intrinsic to sleep, with adolescence marking a dynamic window. These insights may guide interventions to promote healthier sleep across development.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

We can travel internally through a timeline to remember the past and imagine the future (i.e., mental time travel) or watch from an external standpoint to have a panoramic view of history (i.e., mental time watching). However, the neural mechanisms that support these flexible temporal construals remain unclear. To investigate this, we asked participants to learn a fictional religious ritual of 15 events. During fMRI scanning, they were guided to consider the event series from either an internal or external perspective in different tasks. Behavioral results confirmed the success of our manipulation, showing the expected symbolic distance effect in the internal-perspective task and the reverse effect in the external-perspective task. We found that the activation level in the posterior partial cortex correlated positively with sequential distance in the external-perspective task but negatively in the internal-perspective task. In contrast, the activation level in the anterior hippocampus positively correlated with sequential distance regardless of the observer's perspectives. These results suggest that the hippocampus stores the memory of the event sequences allocentrically in a perspective-agnostic manner. Conversely, the posterior parietal cortex retrieves event sequences egocentrically from the optimal perspective for the current task context. Such complementary allocentric and egocentric representations support both the stability of memory storage and the flexibility of time construals.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

We analysed data from five young and old adult cohorts (MRi-Share, Human Connectome Project, UK Biobank, Generation Scotland Subsample, and Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 [LBC1936]) to test the validity and utility of LBA inferred from cross-sectional MRI data, i.e., a single MRI scan per participant. LBA was simply calculated based on the relationship between total brain volume (TBV) and intracranial volume (ICV), using three computationally distinct approaches: the difference (ICV-TBV), ratio (TBV/ICV), and regression-residual method (TBV[~]ICV). LBA derived with all three methods were substantially correlated with well-validated neuroradiological atrophy rating scales (r = 0.37-0.44). Compared with the difference or ratio method, LBA computed with the residual method most strongly captured phenotypic variance associated with cognitive decline (r = 0.36), frailty (r = 0.24), age-moderated brain shrinkage (r = 0.45), and longitudinally-measured atrophic changes (r = 0.36). LBA computed using a difference score was strongly correlated with baseline (i.e., ICV; r = 0.81) and yielded GWAS signal similar to ICV (rg = 0.75). We performed the largest genetic study of LBA to date (N = 43,110), which was highly heritable (h2 SNP GCTA = 41% [95% CI = 38-43%]) and had strong polygenic signal (LDSC h2 = 26%; mean{chi} 2 = 1.23). The strongest association in our genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated WNT16, a gene previously linked with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, and Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study is the first side-by-side evaluation of different computational approaches to estimate lifetime brain changes and their measurement characteristics. Careful assessment of methods for LBA computation had important implications for the interpretation of existing phenotypic and genetic results, and showed that relying on the residual method to estimate LBA from a single MRI scan captured brain shrinkage rather than current brain size. This makes this computationally-simple definition of LBA a strong candidate for more powerful analyses, promising accelerated genetic discoveries by maximising the use of available cross-sectional data.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

Acute infections have shown to change decisions to engage in effortful and rewarding activities, but it is currently unclear whether fatigue and depressive symptoms similarly affect decision making during acute and persistent phases of a COVID infection. Here, we investigated whether fatigue and depressive mood are associated with altered weighting of effort and reward in decision-making during different timepoints after COVID infection.

MethodsWe conducted an online cross-sectional study between March 2021 and March 2022. 242 Participants (18-65 years) with COVID <4 weeks ago (n=62), COVID >12 weeks ago (n=81), or no prior COVID (self-reported) (n=90) performed an effort-based decision-making task, in which they decided whether they wanted to exert physical effort (ticking boxes on screen, 5 levels) for reward (money to be gained in a voucher-lottery, 5 levels). State fatigue and depressive mood was measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) prior to the task. We used multilevel binomial regression analysis to test whether fatigue and depressive mood were related to acceptance rates for effort and reward levels and whether this differed between the groups.

ResultsCompared with no COVID and COVID <4 weeks groups, the COVID >12 weeks group reported higher state fatigue scores (mean{+/-}SD: 20{+/-}7 vs. 14{+/-}7 and 12{+/-}6 POMS-score, respectively; both p<0.001) and was less sensitive to rewards (Reward*Group: OR: 0.35 (95%CI 0.20, 0.62), p<0.001 and OR: 0.38 (95%CI 0.20, 0.72), p=0.003). In the COVID >12 weeks group, fatigue was more negatively associated with reward sensitivity compared with the COVID <4 weeks group (Reward*Fatigue*Group: OR 0.47 (95%CI 0.25, 1.13), p=0.022) and the no COVID group (Reward*Fatigue*Group: OR 0.48 (95%CI 4.01, 0.92), p=0.029). No group differences were observed for the relationship between fatigue and effort sensitivity. No group differences were observed for the relationship between depressive mood and effort or reward sensitivity. Higher age, lower BMI, unhealthy lifestyle, and worrying during the acute phase of COVID each predicted decreased reward sensitivity in the >12 weeks group (Age*Reward: OR 0.30 (95%CI 0.19, 0.48), p<0.001; BMI*Reward: OR 1.43 (95%CI 1.01, 2.00), p=0.047); Lifestyle*Reward: OR 1.50 (95%CI 1.06, 2.14), p=0.022; Worrying*Reward: OR 0.59 (95%CI 0.38, 0.94), p=0.025, respectively).

ConclusionThe finding that fatigue is related to lower reward sensitivity >12 weeks after COVID, suggesting potential reward deficits in post-covid fatigue. These findings are in line with previous observations that long-term inflammation can induce dysregulations in neural reward processing, which should be further investigated in future studies.

In the current study, we used high-resolution shotgun metagenomics and targeted metabolomics to characterize SARS-CoV-2-associated changes in the gut microbiota from young (2-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) hamsters, a valuable model of COVID-19. We show that age-related dysfunctions in the gut microbiota are linked to disease severity and long-term sequelae in older hamsters. Our data also reveal age-specific changes in the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota during both the acute phase (day 7 post-infection, D7) and the recovery phase (D22) of infection. Aged hamsters exhibited the most notable shifts in gut microbiota composition and plasma metabolic profiles. Through an integrative analysis of metagenomics, metabolomics, and clinical data, we identified significant associations between bacterial taxa, metabolites and disease markers in the aged group. On D7 (high viral load and lung epithelial damage) and D22 (body weight loss and fibrosis), numerous amino acids, amino acid-related molecules, and indole derivatives were found to correlate with disease markers. In particular, a persistent decrease in phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and indoleacetic acid in aged animals positively correlated with poor recovery of body weight and/or lung fibrosis by D22. In younger hamsters, several bacterial taxa (Eubacterium, Oscillospiraceae, Lawsonibacter) and plasma metabolites (carnosine and cis-aconitic acid) were associated with mild disease outcomes. These findings support the need for age-specific microbiome-targeting strategies to more effectively manage acute viral pneumonia and long-term disease outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

These hyphal networks represent a carbon sink in soil, thus it has been suggested that these fungi can also boost atmospheric carbon sequestration, highlighting their potential role in managing greenhouse emissions. In this study, we aimed to determine whether certain AMF genotypes and nuclear organizations (homokaryons vs heterokaryons) are associated with higher rates of host plant yield and carbon storage. To assess this, we compared Sudan-grass (Sorghum x drummondii) AMF inoculation across 8 strains of Rhizophagus irregularis: 4 homokaryotic and 4 heterokaryotic strains. Sudan-grass was grown in a growth chamber, which included 13C-CO2 pulse labeling to track plant carbon into AMF. AMF inoculation increased total and root biomass, as well as phosphorous, magnesium and manganese uptake in the host. Heterokaryons led to greater root biomass, as well as less variable increases in shoot phosphorous. Host biomass had a significant positive effect on mycorrhizal carbon inputs to the soil. Mycorrhizal inputs to the mineral associated organic carbon - a more persistent carbon pool with slow turnover - were overall greater in heterokaryons than in homokaryons but varied significantly among strains. This indicates that the potential for carbon storage by mycorrhizal carbon inputs varies based on both fungal genomic identity and nuclear organization. Overall, inoculation improved the yield of Sudan-grass and resulted in significant inter-strain variation in persistent carbon contributions to the soil. This work highlights the importance of considering genotype and nuclear identity in assessments of AMF as bio-stimulants and drivers of carbon sequestration.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

First, an incremental treadmill exercise test was performed to obtain submaximal (lactate threshold) and maximal (VO2peak) data. Thereafter, visit two involved 4 x 3-min running intervals at 90% of the final incremental test velocity (vVO2peak), with 90 secs rest between intervals.

Further identification of underlying mutual and unique biological mechanisms may yield novel multi-disorder and disorder-specific therapeutic targets. The metabolome represents an important domain for target identification as metabolites play critical roles in modulating a diverse range of biological processes. Here, we used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to test the causal effects of [~]1000 plasma metabolites and [~]300 metabolite ratios on anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and multiple sclerosis. In total, 85 causal effects involving 77 unique metabolites passed FDR correction and robust sensitivity analyses (IVW-MR OR range: 0.73-1.48; pFDR < 0.05). No evidence of reverse causality was identified. Multivariate analyses implicated sphingolipid metabolism in psychiatric disorder risk and carnitine derivatives in risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. However, polygenic risk scores for prioritised metabolites showed limited prediction in the UK Biobank. Downstream colocalisation in regions containing influential variants identified greater than suggestive evidence (PP.H4 [&ge;] 0.6) for a shared causal variant for 29 metabolite/psychiatric disorder trait-pairs on chromosome 11 at the FADS gene cluster. Most of these metabolites were lipids containing linoleic or arachidonic acid. Additional colocalisation was identified between the ratio of histidine-to-glutamine, glutamine, Alzheimers disease and SPRYD4 gene expression on chromosome 12. Although no single metabolite had a causal effect on a psychiatric and a neurodegenerative disease, results suggest a broad effect of lipids across brain disorders. Metabolites identified here may help inform future targeted interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955367

This process is guided by the accumulation of the plant hormone auxin and the polar localisation of the efflux protein PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). The transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) plays a crucial role in orienting PIN1 polarity, thereby facilitating auxin-driven organogenesis. In this study, we investigated how MP regulates PIN1 polarity and organogenesis, discovering that the downstream vascular transcription factor TMO5 regulates PIN1 polarity non-cell-autonomously and promotes organ initiation in the SAM. Furthermore, we find that exogenous auxin and cytokinin can partially rescue the organ defects associated with loss of MP and TMO5 activity. Collectively, these findings uncover a novel role for TMO5 in controlling PIN1 polarity and driving organogenesis by coordinating hormonal signalling.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

We examined mucosal cells from patients with PCD and related conditions using a multi-omics approach. Methods: We recruited patients with PCD (n = 24), CD without perianal disease (NPCD, n = 10), and idiopathic perianal fistulas (IPF, n = 29). Biopsies were taken from fistula tracts, fistula opening, and rectal mucosa. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), mass cytometry (CyTOF), spatial transcriptomics (ST), immunohistochemistry, and integrated analysis were performed. Results: ScRNA-seq, CyTOF, and ST unraveled immune and non-immune cell compartments in PCD and IPF fistula tracts. PCD fistulas showed hyperactivated pathogenic pathways including interferon (IFN)G response and TNF signaling in myeloid and stromal cells. Intestinal cells from PCD patients also expressed greater levels of IFNG-responsive and EMT genes compared to NPCD patients. Furthermore, both fistula tracts and ileal mucosa from PCD patients harbored expanded IFNG+ pathogenic Th17 cells, which expressed elevated inflammatory mediators. CyTOF also identified skewed immune cell phenotypes in the fistula tracts, fistula opening, and rectum in PCD patients including expanded Th17 cells, increased pathogenic myeloid cells, and altered T cell exhaustion markers. Further analysis also revealed cellular modules associated with anti-TNF therapy in PCD patients. Conclusion: Multi-omics analysis revealed immune, stromal, and epithelial cell landscapes of PCD, which highlight the pathogenic role of hyperactivated IFNG signaling in both fistula tracts and luminal mucosa. This study identified IFNG as a potential therapeutic target for PCD.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

A subset of people with LC present with symptoms resembling those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The objective of this study was to compare cortisol concentrations in those with and without Long COVID, with a particular focus on people experiencing ME/CFS-like Long COVID. METHODS: We measured plasma cortisol in 200 individuals 3-6 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Banked biospecimens collected between 8 AM-12 PM were used. Participants met the case definition for Long COVID if they had >=1 COVID-attributed symptom at least 3 months after symptom onset. People who did not report any symptoms at least 3 months after symptom onset served as recovered controls. Adapting the 2015 Institute of Medicine criteria for ME/CFS, we further defined those with LC resembling ME/CFS (LC-ME). RESULTS: We found no difference in overall morning cortisol concentrations between people with LC (n=144) and those who fully recovered (n=56) (median 8.9 g/dL vs. 8.8 g/dL, p=0.97). Analyses of samples collected between 8-10 AM, however, revealed that, compared to those who fully recovered, cortisol concentrations were lower between 8-9 AM for those with LC-ME (median 8.2 vs. 14.8, p=0.02), but higher between 9-10 AM for those with severe LC (>=5 symptoms) (median 12.4 vs. 8.5, p=0.009) and those with LC-ME (median 13.7 vs. 8.5, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: We found no difference in overall morning plasma cortisol concentrations between those with and without Long COVID. Although our data could be suggestive of altered morning cortisol dynamics in a subset of people with Long COVID, longitudinal measures of cortisol in individuals with Long COVID will be critical to further inform the biology of the condition.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955367

Despite existing evidence that not all phenotypes are equally likely to successfully establish in new areas, the mechanistic underpinnings of natal dispersal remain poorly understood. The propensity to disperse into a new environment can be favored by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity which facilitates local adaptation and may be achieved via epigenetic mechanisms, which modify gene expression and enable rapid phenotypic changes. Epigenetic processes occur in particular genomic regions (e.g. DNA methylation on CpG sites in vertebrates), and thus individual genomes may differ in their capacity to be modified epigenetically. This 'Epigenetic potential' (EP) may represent the range of phenotypic plasticity attainable by an individual, and be a key determinant of successful settlement in novel areas. We investigated the association between EP, quantified as the number of genome-wide CpG variants, and natal dispersal propensity in a long-term study population of Pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) monitored since colonization of a new habitat 35 years ago. We tested this association at three levels, comparing EP between: i) individuals dispersing between and within habitat patches; ii) immigrants to the population and locally-born individuals; and iii) individuals from first (comprising colonizers or their direct descendants) and latter generations of the population (consisting of locally-born individuals, which did not show natal dispersal). Results show a significant, positive association between EP and dispersal propensity in comparisons i) and iii), but not ii). Furthermore, CpG variants were non-randomly distributed across the genome, suggesting species- and/or population-specific CpGs being more frequent in promoters and exons. Our findings point to EP playing a role in dispersal propensity at spatial and temporal scales, supporting the idea that epigenetically-driven phenotypic plasticity facilitates dispersal and environmental coping in free-living birds.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

Our pipeline leverages artificial intelligence and the latest advances in knowledge embedding techniques to exploit currently available biomedical data and subsequently prioritise pharmacogenes for each drug.

Recent advances in covalent macrocycle peptide discovery, driven by phage and mRNA display methods, have enabled the rapid identification of highly potent and selective molecules from large libraires of diverse macrocycles. However, there are currently limited examples of macrocycles that can be used to disrupt protein-protein interactions and even fewer examples that function by formation of a covalent bond to a target protein. In this work, we describe a directed counter-selection method that enables identification of covalent macrocyclic ligands targeting a protein-protein interaction using a phage display screening platform. This method utilizes binary and ternary screenings of a chemically modified phage display library, employing the stable and weakly reactive aryl fluorosulfate electrophile. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-ACE2 protein-protein interaction and identify multiple covalent macrocyclic inhibitors that disrupt this interaction. The resulting compounds displayed antiviral activity against live virus that was irreversible after washout due to the covalent binding mechanism. These results highlight the potential of this screening platform for developing covalent macrocyclic drugs that disrupt protein-protein interactions with long lasting effects.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

Also prevalent are clusters of multicopy genes for production of diverse glycoconjugates that could contribute to decoration of the host cell surface, or of putative capsid proteins that we predict multimerize into hexagonal arrays. Features including megabase-scale linear genomes with inverted terminal repeats, genomic repertoires for energy metabolism, central carbon compound transformations and translation, and pervasive direct repeat regions are shared with giant viruses of eukaryotes, although analyses suggest that these parallels arose via convergent evolution.

We measured activity across PFC and connected thalamic nuclei of monkeys applying rules. Abstract rule information first appeared in ventroanterior thalamus (VA) - the main thalamic hub between BG and PFC. Mediodorsal thalamus (MD) also represented rule information before PFC, persisting to help maintain activation of relevant PFC cell ensembles. MD, a major recipient of midbrain dopamine input, was first to represent information about behavioral outcomes.

Understanding the molecular basis of such diseases has long been challenging, owing to a lack of models accurately reflecting disease genotypes and phenotypes. To address this challenge, we develop and characterize in vitro human cartilage derived from wild-type and disease-causing Arg719Cys COL2A1 isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. Methods Using directed differentiation of iPSCs to chondrocytes, we generated cartilage from wild-type and Arg719Cys COL2A1 lines. We compared the resulting protein, cell, and tissue properties using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, SDS-PAGE, RNA-sequencing, and quantitative interactomics. Results While both wild-type and disease lines deposited a cartilage matrix, the Arg719Cys matrix was deficient. Arg719Cys collagen-II was excessively post-translationally modified and modestly intracellularly retained, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distention suggestive of an ER storage defect. Interactomic studies indicated that Arg719Cys procollagen-II was not differentially engaged by the ER proteostasis network. RNA-sequencing showed that the ER storage defect engendered by Arg719Cys procollagen-II also did not activate cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response. These data suggest that cells fail to properly recognize Arg719Cys-associated procollagen-II defects. Conclusions A failure to identify and rectify defective procollagen-II folding in cells expressing Arg719Cys procollagen-II leads to the deposition of a sparse and defective collagen-II matrix, culminating in pathology. Combined with the highly expandable human cartilage disease model reported here, this work provides motivation and a platform to discover therapeutic strategies targeting procollagen folding, quality control, and secretion in this collagenopathy and others.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

Restoration efforts and effective treatment of SCTLD requires an in-depth understanding of its pathogenesis in the coral holobiont as well as mechanisms of disease resistance. Here, we present a supervised machine learning framework to describe SCTLD progression in a major reef-building coral, Montastraea cavernosa, and its dominant algal endosymbiont, Cladocopium goreaui. Utilizing support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) in conjunction with differential expression analysis, we identify a subset of biologically relevant genes that exhibit the highest classification performance across three types of coral tissues collected from a natural reef environment: apparently healthy tissue on an apparently healthy colony, apparently healthy tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony, and lesion tissue on a SCTLD-affected colony. By analyzing gene expression signatures associated with these tissue health states in both the coral host and its algal endosymbiont (family Symbiodiniaceae), we describe key processes involved in SCTLD resistance and disease progression within the coral holobiont. Our findings further support evidence that SCTLD causes dysbiosis between the coral host and its Symbiodinaiceae and additionally describes the metabolic and immune shifts that occur as the holobiont transitions from a healthy to a diseased state. This supervised machine learning framework offers a novel approach to accurately assess the health states of endangered coral species and brings us closer to developing effective solutions for disease monitoring and intervention.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

To determine the molecular mechanisms of species- and tissue-specificity for homologous TBPs, we examined the ability of yeast TBP and murine TBP paralogs to replace the endogenous TBP in mouse embryonic stem cells. We show that, despite the high conservation in the DNA binding domain among the homologs, they cannot fully rescue the lethality of TBP depletion in mESCs, largely due to their inability to support RNA Pol III transcription. Furthermore, we show that the homologs differentially support stress-induced transcription reprogramming, with the divergent N-terminal domain playing a role in modulating changes in transcriptional response.

As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of >1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in Drosophila brains.

However, the effects of drugs targeting human pathways on fungal cells, and whether they influence antifungal drug responses, are poorly understood. Methods We systematically analyzed clinical guidelines to shortlist non-antifungal drugs commonly used in conditions that increase the likelihood of fungal infections. Focusing on the most prevalent fungal pathogen, we then tested how these drugs affected the antifungal response of Candida albicans to two commonly used antifungals, fluconazole and anidulafungin. Drug interactions identified were further assessed using checkerboard and disk diffusion assays. Finally, antifungal treatment efficacy of fluconazole in combination with negatively interaction drugs was evaluated in an in vivo Galleria mellonella model of disseminated C. albicans infection. Findings Out of 119 drugs frequently co-administered with antifungals in 40 conditions associated with a high risk of fungal infections, 34 compounds affected the antifungal drug response in C. albicans, with most drugs reducing or antagonising antifungal efficacy, several through increasing resistance or tolerance. Notably, fluconazole combinations with carvedilol and loperamide promoted antifungal resistance in both fungal cultures and in Galleria mellonella. Interpretation Our findings suggest that medications frequently taken by patients at risk of fungal infections regularly act on the fungal pathogens and can affect the effectiveness of antifungals. We propose that human drugs acting on fungal pathogens may be an underestimated factor contributing to the evolution of antifungal tolerance and resistance.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

In the current study, we extracted a neural signature of temporal context from scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether recalling a recurring event accompanies the reinstatement of one or multiple instances of its occurrence. We asked 52 young adults to study and recall lists of words that included both once-presented and repeated items. Participants recalled repeated items in association with neighboring list items from each occurrence, but with stronger clustering around the repetition's initial occurrence. Furthermore, multivariate spectral EEG analyses revealed that neural activity from just prior to the recall of these words resembled patterns of activity observed near the item's first occurrence, but not its second. Together, these results suggest that the initial occurrence of an event carries stronger temporal context associations than later repetitions.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

With over 8,000 cases and counting in Brazil, there have been two deaths in young women with no known comorbidities, and infection with Oropouche was associated with a late term stillbirth. While OROV has been sporadically detected in Colombia since 2017, with a handful of cases in Cucuta and Leticia, the distribution of OROV prior to that remains unknown. Therefore, we undertook to test a clinical cohort of febrile patients from Colombia to determine if OROV was circulating within the human population earlier than previously determined. We screened 631 serum samples collected in 2014-2015 from three municipalities: Cucuta, Los Patios, and Ocana. We found evidence of OROV infection in three patients from Ocana, though live virus was not recoverable from patient sera. These data suggest that OROV circulation, while sporadically detected in Colombia, has circulated earlier than previously thought. With the emergence and expansion of new or neglected viruses, there is a need to expand screening of febrile patients both retro- and prospectively to describe and better understand the distribution of arbovirus circulation in human populations. Surveillance for OROV across South America is necessary going forward, especially as the outbreak in Brazil continues.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955367

Individuals who consume alcohol to alleviate the effects of social stress are more likely to develop an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Repeated social defeat stress (SDS) enhances the rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie social stress-escalated alcohol drinking are not well understood. Here we explored the role of the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (Dyn/KOR) system in regulating social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Methods: Male and female mice were subjected to repeated SDS for 10 days following which they were left undisturbed in their home cages. They were then subject to intermittent access (IA) two-bottle choice alcohol consumption procedure. The effects of systemic and BNST-specific KOR antagonism using the selective KOR antagonist NorBNI on stress-escalated drinking were evaluated. Using chemogenetic approaches in Oprk1-Cre mice, we examined the role of KOR expressing cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLAKORs) and BLAKOR-BNST pathway in social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Results: Repeated SDS increased alcohol consumption and preference in both males and females. Systemic KOR antagonism attenuated SDS- escalated alcohol consumption in both males and females. BNST -specific KOR antagonism also attenuated stress-escalated drinking in males. Finally, selective chemogenetic activation of BLAKORs and BKAKOR-BNST pathway attenuated social stress-escalated alcohol consumption in both sexes. Conclusion: Our results suggest a significant role for BLAKOR projections to the BNST in regulating social stress-escalated alcohol consumption. Our results provide further evidence that the Dyn/KOR system maybe a viable target for medications development to treat comorbid stress and AUD.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

The ER-to-Golgi transport must be tightly regulated during adaptation to environmental stress. However, the sensing mechanism and regulatory pathways governing the consecutive formation, budding and transportation of COPII vesicles from the ER remain insufficiently explored. Here, we present evidence indicating that COPII-mediated vesicle transport is transcriptionally controlled through the phosphatidic acid-dependent Opi1-Ino2/Ino4 regulatory circuit. Our analysis indicates that YIP3, a target gene of Ino2/Ino4, exerts a negative regulatory impact on COPII-mediated vesicle transport. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ino2/Ino4 but not Yip3 modulates Sar1 activation, the initial step in COPII vesicle formation, whereas Yip3 hinders Sec16 assembly on the ER membrane, thereby implying that Ino2/Ino4 governs COPII-mediated trafficking at multiple steps. Thus, this study provides the first evidence for an ER sensing system that transcriptionally fine-tunes multiple steps of anterograde vesicular transport in response to alterations in lipid composition of the ER membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

The consequences of focal brain injury on global neuronal activity in aged individuals are poorly understood. Historically, stroke and aging have been associated with changes in narrow-band periodic neuronal activity, however recent work has highlighted the importance of broad-band aperiodic activity. Aperiodic activity is represented by the 1/f slope of power spectral density generated by cortical activity. Abnormalities in aperiodic activity have been identified in psychiatric disorders and stroke, are associated with cognitive dysfunction in aging, and have been hypothesized to reflect changes in excitation/inhibition balance. Here we sought to further explore changes in both periodic and aperiodic cortical activity in neurotypical intact young and aged healthy individuals and individuals with stroke. We compared resting state electroencephalograms from all participants after applying the specparam algorithm, which decomposes the power spectrum into aperiodic and periodic components. We also correlated stroke outcomes using previously obtained tests of motor outcome (box and block) to average whole cortex spectral slopes within the stroke group. Consistent with prior work we found a significant flattening (decrease in exponent) of power spectral slope with normal aging. We also found that both aging and stroke were associated with fewer periodic peaks within the power spectrum. Interestingly, we found that stroke was associated with a significant increase in spectral slope, but age moderated this effect. Younger stroke patients showed minimal difference in slope while older stroke patients had significantly steeper slopes (opposite to the direction in normal aging). Using MRIs from stroke participants we investigated the lesion locations most associated with changes in slope. Interestingly deep lesions were observed to have the greatest influence on cortical spectral slope. Finally, slope in the stroke group was correlated with performance on a test of manual dexterity, however this correlation was much more significant in aged individuals. Our data suggest that stroke in the aged brain has unique effects on aperiodic activity possibly reflecting unique influence of injury on cerebral excitation/inhibition balance in aged individuals and that the degree of these changes may be related to stroke outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

However, limitations in mammalian models make it difficult to identify mechanisms underpinning age-related DNA methylation changes. Here, we show that the short-lived model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exhibits a loss of epigenetic integrity during aging, causing heterochromatin DNA methylation decay and the expression of transposable elements. We show that the rate of epigenetic aging can be manipulated by extending or curtailing lifespan, and that shoot apical meristems are protected from this aging process. We demonstrate that a program of transcriptional repression suppresses DNA methylation maintenance pathways during aging, and that mutants of this mechanism display a complete absence of epigenetic decay. This presents a new paradigm in which a gene regulatory program sets the rate of epigenomic information loss during aging.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955367

The study stratified patients by severity and analysed the trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and multiple immune variables for features associated with primary and recall immune responses.

FindingsIsotype-specific antibody trajectories to SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed a pattern of recall response in 94{middle dot}2% of cases. In these cases, the detailed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cells, cTfh high-resolution subsets, and cytokines were consistent with a secondary response. The transcriptomic data indicated that this cohort is strictly comparable to contemporary cohorts.

ConclusionsIn most cases, the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is a recall response. This opens the possibility that most COVID-19 cases are subjected to immune imprinting by endemic coronavirus, which, in turn, can contribute to severity by interfering with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and by antibody-dependent enhancement. Considering the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 secondary provides a better perspective to interpret COVID-19 pathology.

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha propagates clonally through vegetative gemmae or via sexually generated spores, but our understanding of the genetic pathways underpinning reproductive decision-making is limited. GRAS transcriptional regulators are highly conserved proteins across land plants, with diverse functionality in stress and development. Here, we discover a central role for the SCLA-type transcription regulator MpGRAS7 in both stress signalling and reproduction in Marchantia. MpGRAS7 is highly expressed in gemma cups and gametangiophores and is activated in response to Far Red (FR) light and abscisic acid (ABA) environmental cues. Genetic dissection further suggests MpGRAS7 is required to maintain gemma dormancy, gemma cup frequency, and FR-induced gametangiophore development. The sequence conservation and expression patterns of MpGRAS7 orthologs in flowering plants hints towards the broader function of SCLA-type GRAS proteins in stress-regulated developmental transitions in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Mechanistically, we directly show that strand invasion and subsequent HR defects upon BRCA2 loss primarily arises from the unrestricted removal of RAD51 from DSB sites by FIGNL1, rather than from defective RAD51 loading. Furthermore, we identify that the MMS22L-TONSL complex interacts with FIGNL1 and is critical for HR in BRCA2/FIGNL1 double-deficient cells. These findings identify a pathway for tightly regulating RAD51 activity to promote efficient HR, offering insights into mechanisms of chemoresistance in BRCA2-deficient tumors.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Recently, protein phase separation has been observed at cellular membranes, suggesting it may play a role in the assembly of protein complexes. Inspired by these findings, we observed that protein condensates on one side of a planar suspended membrane spontaneously colocalized with those on the opposite side. How might this phenomenon contribute to the assembly of stable transmembrane complexes? To address this question, we examined the diffusion and growth of protein condensates on both sides of membranes. Our results reveal that transmembrane coupling of protein condensates on opposite sides of the membrane slows down condensate diffusion while accelerating condensate growth. How can the rate of condensate growth increase simultaneously with a decrease in the rate of condensate diffusion? We provide insights into these seemingly contradictory observations by distinguishing between diffusion-limited and coupling-driven growth processes. While transmembrane coupling slows down diffusion, it also locally concentrates condensates within a confined area. This confinement increases the probability of condensate coalescence and thereby enhances the overall rate of growth for coupled condensates, substantially surpassing the growth rate for uncoupled condensates. These findings suggest that transmembrane coupling could play a role in the assembly of diverse membrane-bound structures by promoting the localization and growth of protein complexes on both membrane surfaces. This phenomenon could help to explain the efficient assembly of transmembrane structures in diverse cellular contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected a high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss-RNA iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

The mechanisms imposing a different crossover landscape in female and male meiosis remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously disrupted multiple anti-crossover mechanisms in Arabidopsis and analyzed the whole genome sequence of thousands of female- and male-derived progenies. The largest crossover increase was reached in zyp1 recq4, with 12-fold in females and a 4.5-fold increase in males. Despite this unprecedented level of crossovers, fertility is marginally affected, opening new possibilities for plant breeding. Manipulating additional crossover regulators in zyp1 recq4 did not further elevate the frequency of crossovers, but modified the relative contributions of the two known crossover pathways. This suggests an upper limit was reached and the two pathways compete for a large but limited set of recombination intermediates. Remarkably, while wild-type crossover distribution differs markedly between sexes, the crossover landscapes of diverse mutants in both females and males converge to a single novel profile, which we termed Crossover Potential (COP). The COP profile, which we defined using 49,482 crossovers, can be accurately predicted using only sequence divergence and chromatin features. We propose that the COP represents the density of eligible recombination precursors, which is determined by genomic features and is thus identical in females and males. It suggests that the sexual dimorphism in the crossover landscape results exclusively from differential regulation of the likeness of precursors to mature into crossovers.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Besides eliminating the external viral reservoir, cage change also induced a transcriptional defense response in the intestinal epithelium. We further identified that displacing infected animals initially caused a temporary period of immune suppression through the stress hormone corticosterone, which was followed by an immune rebound characterized by an increase in CD8 T cells responsible for the epithelial antiviral responses. Our findings show how viral persistence can be disrupted by preventing re-exposure and activating immunity upon stress recovery, indicating that external factors can be manipulated to shorten the duration of a viral infection.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Here we assess the ability of protein language models (PLMs), routinely applied to protein folding, to be retrained for PPI prediction. Existing PPI prediction models that exploit PLMs use a pre-trained PLM feature set, ignoring that the proteins are physically interacting. Our novel method, PLM-interact, goes beyond a single protein, jointly encoding protein pairs to learn their relationships, analogous to the next-sentence prediction task from natural language processing. This approach provides a significant improvement in performance: Trained on human-human PPIs, PLM-interact predicts mouse, fly, worm, E. coli and yeast PPIs, achieving between 16-28% improvements in AUPR compared with state-of-the-art PPI models. Additionally, it can detect changes that disrupt or cause PPIs and be applied to virus-host PPI prediction. Our work demonstrates that large language models can be extended to learn the intricate relationships among biomolecules from sequences alone.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

In contrast to the extensive morphological and molecular characterization of sensory neurons, there has been little description of the cells that control ion concentrations in the zebrafish olfactory system. Here, we report the molecular and ultrastructural characterization of zebrafish olfactory ionocytes. Transcriptome analysis suggests that the zebrafish olfactory epithelium contains at least three different ionocyte types, which resemble Na+/K+-ATPase-rich (NaR), Na+/Cl- cotransporter (NCC), and H+-ATPase-rich (HR) cells, responsible for calcium, chloride, and pH regulation, respectively, in the zebrafish skin. NaR-like and HR-like ionocytes are usually adjacent to one another, whereas NCC-like cells are usually solitary. The distinct subtypes are differentially distributed: NaR-like/HR-like cell pairs are found broadly within the olfactory epithelium, whereas NCC-like cells reside within the peripheral non-sensory multiciliated cell zone. Comparison of gene expression and serial-section electron microscopy analysis indicates that the NaR-like cells wrap around the HR-like cells and are connected to them by shallow tight junctions. The development of olfactory ionocyte subtypes is also differentially regulated, as pharmacological Notch inhibition leads to a loss of NaR-like and HR-like cells, but does not affect NCC-like ionocyte number. These results provide a molecular and anatomical characterization of olfactory ionocytes in a stenohaline freshwater teleost. The paired ionocytes suggest that both transcellular and paracellular transport regulate ion concentrations in the olfactory epithelium, while the solitary ionocytes may enable independent regulation of multiciliated cells.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Herbivore-induced defensive outputs are regulated by the circadian clock, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate how the plant circadian clock regulates transcriptional reprogramming of a specific HAMP-induced pathway, we characterized the daytime and nighttime transcriptional response to caterpillar-derived In11 peptide, in the legume crop cowpea (Vigna unguiculata). Using diurnal and free-running conditions, we found that daytime In11 elicitation resulted in stronger late-induced gene expression than nighttime. Plants with a conditional arrhythmic phenotype in constant light (LL) conditions lost time-of-day dependent responses to In11 treatment, and this was associated with arrhythmic expression of circadian clock core transcription factor Late Elongated Hypocotyl VuLHY1 and VuLHY2. Reporter assays with VuLHY homologs indicated that they interact with the promoter of daytime In11-induced Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor (VuKTI) via a canonical and a polymorphic CCA1/LHY Binding Site (CBS), consistent with a mechanism of direct regulation by circadian clock transcription factors.

The COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions in the US. It remains unclear, however, how medical and societal changes during this period affected national chronic pain prevalence, a key dimension of population health.

ObjectiveTo determine prevalence of chronic pain (CP) and high-impact chronic pain (HICP) before, during, and after COVID-19 pandemic and explore reasons driving the trends

MethodsWe use data from the 2019, 2021, and 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a multi-wave cross-sectional survey. Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian US population age 18 and older (n=88,469). Year of interview is the exposure. All regression models control for age and sex; some models include additional 19 covariates (demographics, socioeconomic status, health behaviors, health conditions, mental health, and health insurance type); analyses also explore the role of COVID and long COVID. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of CP and HICP measured via widely-used validated measures. CP was based on the question ""In the past 3 months, how often did you have pain? Would you say never, some days, most days, or every day?""; CP is defined as pain on most days or every day. HICP was defined as chronic pain that limited life or work activities on most days or every day (versus never or some days).

ResultsChronic pain prevalence was 20.6% (19.9-21.2%) in 2019, 20.9% (20.3-21.6%) in 2021, and 24.3% (23.7-25.0%) in 2023. HICP also increased from 7.5% (7.1-7.8%) in 2019, to 8.5% (8.1-8.9%) in 2023, after a decline to 6.9% (6.6-7.3%) in 2021. The 2023 increases occurred in all examined body sites except for dental pain. COVID and long COVID had a modest role in the population-wide pain increases, the causes of which remain unclear.

Conclusions and RelevancePain among US adults was high before the pandemic but surged dramatically since. In 2023, an unprecedented 60 million Americans had chronic pain and 21 million had high-impact chronic pain.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955368

SARS-CoV-2 M adopts two conformations, Mshort and Mlong, and regulated transition between states is hypothesized to coordinate viral assembly and budding. However, the factors that regulate M conformation and roles for each state are unknown. Here, we discover a direct M-sphingolipid interaction that controls M conformational dynamics and virus assembly. We show M binds Golgi-enriched anionic lipids including ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). Molecular dynamics simulations show C1P interaction promotes a long to short transition and energetically stabilizes Mshort. Cryo-EM structures show C1P specifically binds Mshort at a conserved site bridging transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Disrupting Mshort-C1P interaction alters M subcellular localization, reduces interaction with Spike and E, and impairs subsequent virus-like particle cell entry. Together, these results show endogenous signaling lipids regulate M structure and support a model in which Mshort is stabilized in the early endomembrane system to organize other structural proteins prior to viral budding.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Cryo-IEF excels in various cryo-EM data processing tasks, such as classifying particles from different structures, clustering particles by pose, and assessing the quality of particle images. Upon fine-tuning, the model effectively ranks particle images by quality at high efficiency, enabling the creation of CryoWizard--a fully automated single-particle cryo-EM data processing pipeline. This pipeline has successfully resolved high-resolution structures of diverse properties and proven adept at mitigating the prevalent preferred orientation challenge in many cryo-EM samples.

This study directly probes whether the neural code of a phrase involves reactivating the syntactic property of a key subcomponent (the phrasal head). To this end, we train a part-of-speech sliding-window neural decoder (verb vs. adverb) on EEG signals recorded while participants (N = 30) read sentences in a controlled experiment. The decoder reaches above-chance performance that is spatiotemporally consistent and generalizes to unseen data across sentence positions. Appling the decoder to held-out data yields predicted activation levels for the verbal head of a verb phrase at a distant non-head word (adverb); the critical adverb appeared either at the end of a verb phrase, or at a sequentially and lexically matched position with no verb phrase boundary. There is stronger verb activation beginning at ~600 milliseconds at the critical adverb when it appears at a verb phrase boundary; this effect is not modulated by the strength of conceptual association between the two subcomponents in the verb phrase nor does it reflect word predictability. Time-locked analyses additionally reveal a negativity waveform component and increased beta-delta inter-trial phase coherence, both previously linked to linguistic composition, in a similar time window. With a novel application of neural decoding, our findings delineate the temporal dynamics by which the brain encodes phrasal representations by, in part, reactivating the representation of key subcomponents. We thus establish a link between cognitive accounts of phrase structure representations and electrophysiological dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

A subset of sequenced SAR11 genomes, predominantly in the brackish and freshwater SAR11 subclades, contain homologs of pha genes, which in other organisms confer the ability to store carbon and energy via polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) polymers. Here, we investigated the relevance of PHA production to SAR11 biology. Phylogenetics showed that Pha proteins occurred on a long branch and provided evidence for origin at the common ancestor of the brackish IIIa and freshwater LD12 subclades, followed by horizontal transfer within SAR11. Using the LD12 representative ""Candidatus Fonsibacter ubiquis"" strain LSUCC0530, we found that a large minority of LSUCC0530 cells contained a single Nile red-staining granule, confirmed that the cells produced polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and estimated the total PHB content in the cells. We heterologously expressed the LSUCC0530 phaCAB locus in Escherichia coli, finding it to be functional and the likely origin of the PHB. We also determined that, irrespective of changes to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations, a similar fraction of LSUCC0530 cells generated PHB granules and expression of the phaCAB locus remained constant. We suggest that PHB synthesis in LSUCC0530 may be constitutively active due to the slow growth dynamics and minimal regulation that characterize SAR11 bacteria. This is the first characterization of polymer storage in SAR11, providing new insights into the likely fitness advantage for cells harboring this metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Here we report an autocatalytic assembly pathway that generates a chimeric, amino acid-bridged aminoacyl-RNA synthetase ribozyme. The noncovalent complex of ribozyme fragments initiates low level aminoacylation of one of the fragments, which after loop-closing ligation generates a highly active covalently-linked chimeric ribozyme. The generation of this ribozyme is increasingly efficient over time due to the autocatalytic assembly cycle that sustains the ribozyme over indefinite cycles of serial dilution. Due to its trans activity, this ribozyme also assembles ribozymes distinct from itself, such as the hammerhead, suggesting that RNA aminoacylation, coupled with nonenzymatic ligation, could have facilitated the emergence and propagation of ribozymes.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

For brevity, we use the term GLP-1 RA to refer to both GLP-1 RA and dual GLP-1 RA/GIP medications.

ObjectiveTo describe recent trends in prescribing and dispensing of GLP-1-based medications in the US.

MethodsUsing a subset of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta, a growing collective of health systems that provide more than 18% of all daily clinical care in the US, we identified people who were prescribed a GLP-1-based medication between January 01, 2018 and June 30, 2024. We describe prescribing volumes and patient characteristics over time, by medication, and by FDA-labeled use. Among the subset of patients for whom post-prescription dispensing data is available, we describe the proportion and characteristics of patients who were and were not dispensed a GLP-1 RA following their prescription.

Results1,162,662 patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and June 2024, with 4,815,135 total prescriptions during this period. Among first-time prescriptions for which use could be established, ADMs accounted for 83.0% and AOMs accounted for 17.0%. The most common first-time medication was semaglutide (n = 644,272). Among those with available data, 70.0% of first-time ADM prescriptions overall and 73.7% in March 2024 had a fill within 60 days. By comparison, 43.6% of first-time AOM prescriptions overall and 47.2% in March 2024 had a fill within 60 days.

Lower amounts of viruses in nasal washes and exhaled aerosols were detected in JN.1 infected wildtype hamsters than EG.5.1, and consistently, JN.1 also exhibited largely reduced airborne transmission.

Traditionally, studies have focused on the role of contemporary ecology---such as pollinator or mate availability---in driving spatial patterns in reproductive assurance within species, however, historical processes such as post-glacial range expansion may be an understudied alternative explanation for geographic variation in mating system. This is because during the process of geographic range expansion into novel habitat, selection should favour individuals that possess traits promoting reproductive assurance (i.e., autonomous selfing or clonal reproduction). Here, we used Northern pink monkeyflower--Erythranthe (Mimulus lewisii--a hermaphroditic, self-compatible, perennial, alpine plant, as a focal species to investigate the historical signatures of geographic range expansion by combining phylogeographic analyses with a greenhouse survey of range-wide reproductive assurance. First, we detected significant geographic variation among populations in two components of reproductive assurance: self-fertilization and clonal propagation. Next, using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, we identified three distinct genetic clusters structured by longitude and estimated geographic coordinates of the most likely origins of range expansion within each cluster. We found that both measures of reproductive assurance significantly increased on average with distance from the inferred biogeographic origin, which is consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive assurance undergoes adaptive evolution during range expansion. This study supports hypotheses underlying Bakers Law and contributes to our understanding of spatial variation in reproductive assurance, which is linked to variation in evolutionary potential, adaptability, and the long-term persistence of populations across large spatial scales.

Lay summaryWhat generates and maintains the amazing diversity in plant reproduction we see today? Traditionally, studies have focused on the role of contemporary ecology, such as pollinator or mate availability, in driving spatial patterns within species, however, historical drivers may be an understudied alternative explanation. Here, we test the hypothesis that expansion into new habitats after glacial retreat, where pollinators or mates were scarce, favors plants with the ability to reproduce in the absence of pollinators and mates by making self-pollinated seeds or vegetative clones of themselves. We find support for the hypothesis, where the probabilities of making both autonomously selfed seed and clonal vegetative propagules increase on average along inferred pathways of range expansion. Our study joins a handful of previous studies that tested and provided support for historical range expansion shaping range-wide spatial variation in reproductive assurance in plants, suggesting post-glacial range expansion may be a common mechanism creating diversity in plant mating systems.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

These predictions are related to dispersal limitation at the leading edge driving colonization dynamics, a scenario common in post-glacial range expansion at the continental scale ([~]20,000 years ago). However, post-glacial range expansion can also occur on contemporary time scales, such as alpine glacier recession following the end of The Little Ice Age ([~]150 years ago) and our understanding of dispersal limitation structuring these instances of rapid range expansion are relatively understudied. Here, we test whether there is evidence supporting the role of dispersal limitation during range expansion following alpine glacier retreat using the native alpine plant Erythranthe (Mimulus) lewisii by examining patterns of neutral genetic diversity (single nucleotide polymorphisms) across the history of glacier recession (i.e., glacier chronosequence) across two glacier forelands in Garibaldi Provincial Park, BC. We find weak support for the prediction of increasing clines in genetic differentiation towards the range edge, and no support for decreasing clines in genetic diversity, suggesting dispersal limitation is not characterizing colonization during range expansion, with the implication that the accumulation of expansion load at the range edge is likely not applicable on these spatiotemporal scales. Together, our results suggest that loss of genetic diversity for range-shifting species in the alpine is likely not a key contributing factor to any decreased fitness over time.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Notably, the data also provide evidence that the outbreak resulted from a single zoonotic transmission event with limited human-to-human transmission, rather than multiple independent zoonotic transmission events. The Rwandan MVD outbreak prompted a thorough investigation that included contact tracing, clinical assessment, travel history, sequencing, and serology testing, to trace the viruss origin.

COVID-19 vaccines that are more closely matched to circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages elicit more potent and relevant immune responses that translate to improved real-world vaccine effectiveness. The rise in prevalence of the Omicron JN.1 lineage, and subsequent derivative sublineages such as KP.2 and KP.3, coincided with reduced neutralizing activity and effectiveness of Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted vaccines. Here, we characterized the biophysical and immunologic attributes of BNT162b2 JN.1- and KP.2-adapted mRNA vaccine-encoded spike (S) protein immunogens. Biophysical interrogations of S revealed the structural consequences of hallmark amino acid substitutions and a potential molecular mechanism of immune escape employed by JN.1 and KP.2. The vaccine candidates were evaluated for their immunogenicity when administered as fourth or fifth doses in BNT162b2-experienced mice or as a primary series in naive mice. In both vaccine-experienced and naive settings, JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccines conferred improved neutralizing responses over the BNT162b2 XBB.1.5 vaccine against a broad panel of emerging JN.1 sublineages, including the predominant KP.3.1.1 and emerging XEC lineages. Antigenic mapping of neutralizing responses indicated greater antigenic overlap of JN.1- and KP.2-adapted vaccine responses with currently circulating sublineages compared to an XBB.1.5-adapted vaccine. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were generally conserved across all three vaccines. Together, the data support the selection of JN.1- or KP.2-adapted vaccines for the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine formula.

ONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYThe Omicron JN.1- and KP.2-adapted BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines encoding prefusion S proteins elicit similar preclinical neutralizing antibody responses against circulating JN.1 sublineage pseudoviruses that are more potent than those elicited by past iterations of BNT162b2 licensed vaccines, thus demonstrating the importance of annual strain changes to the COVID-19 vaccine.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions (e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E), have emerged concurrently. As of October 2024, KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which acquired S:31del, outcompeted other JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3 and is the most predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world. Thereafter, XEC, a recombinant lineage of KS.1.1 (JN.13.1.1.1) and KP.3.3 (JN.1.11.1.3.3), was first identified in Germany on August 7, 2024. XEC acquired two S substitutions, S:T22N and S:F59S, compared with KP.3 through recombination, with a breakpoint at genomic position 21,738-22,599. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of XEC using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on genome surveillance data from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Germany, where this variant has spread as of August 2024. In the USA, the Re of XEC is 1.13-fold higher than that of KP.3.1.1. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein showed higher Re for XEC. These results suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1. We then assessed the virological properties of XEC using pseudoviruses. Pseudovirus infection assay showed that the infectivity of KP.3.1.1 and XEC was significantly higher than that of KP.3. Although S:T22N did not affect the infectivity of the pseudovirus based on KP.3, S:F59S significantly increased it. Neutralization assay was performed using three types of human sera: convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or KP.3.3, and convalescent sera after JN.1 infection. In all serum groups, XEC as well as KP.3.1.1 showed immune resistance when compared to KP.3 with statistically significant differences. In the cases of XBB.1.5 BTI sera and JN.1 infection sera, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50s) of XEC and KP.3.1.1 were comparable. However, we revealed that the NT50 of XEC was significantly (1.3-fold) lower than that of KP.3.1.1. Moreover, both S:T22N and S:F59S significantly (1.5-fold and 1.6-fold) increased the resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera. Here we showed that XEC exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and higher immune evasion than KP.3. Particularly, XEC exhibited more robust immune resistance to KP.3.3 BTI sera than KP.3.1.1. Our data suggest that the higher Re of XEC than KP.3.1.1 is attributed to this property and XEC will be a predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in the world in the near future.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Physical traits sometimes sway voters more than policies do-but why? Here we show that rhesus macaques, who have no knowledge about political candidates or their policies, implicitly predict the outcomes of U.S. gubernatorial and senatorial elections based solely on visual features. Given a pair of candidate photos, monkeys spent more time looking at the loser than the winner, and this gaze bias predicted not only binary election outcomes but also the candidates vote share. Analysis of facial features revealed candidates with more masculine faces were more likely to win an election, and vote share was a linear function of jaw prominence. Our findings endorse the idea that voters spontaneously respond to evolutionarily conserved visual cues to physical prowess and that voting behavior is shaped, in part, by ancestral adaptations shared with nonhuman primates.

Significance StatementWe report that monkeys and humans alike respond spontaneously to evolutionarily conserved facial masculinity cues in political candidates, and this innate sensitivity partly shapes voting behavior, highlighting the imperative for voters to overcome this ancient heuristic by becoming more informed on candidates and their policies.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

These phenotypes were reproducible, heritable (h2 = [4 - 18%]), and significantly associated with cardiometabolic traits and outcomes, including atrial fibrillation (P = 8.5 x 10-29) and myocardial infarction (P = 3.7 x 10-12). By using latent space manipulation techniques, we directly interpreted and visualised what specific latent phenotypes were capturing in a given MRI. To establish the genetic basis of such traits, we performed a genome-wide association study, identifying 89 significant common variants (P < 2.3x10-9) across 42 loci, including seven novel loci. Extensive multi-trait colocalisation analyses (PP.H4 > 0.8) linked these variants to various cardiac traits and diseases, revealing a shared genetic architecture spanning phenotypic scales.

Their expansion shapes genome variability and evolution by impacting gene expression and rearrangement rates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are beneficial plant symbionts with large, TE-rich genomes, and recent findings showed these elements vary significantly in abundance, evolution, and regulation among model AMF strains. Here, we aimed to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of TE function and evolution in AMF by investigating assembled genomes from representatives of all known families. We uncovered multiple, family-specific bursts of insertions in different species, indicating variable past and ongoing TE activity contributing to the diversification of AMF lineages. We also found that TEs are preferentially located within and around candidate effectors/secreted proteins, as well as in proximity to promoters. Altogether, these findings support the role of TEs in promoting the diversity in proteins involved in molecular dialogues with hosts and, more generally, in driving gene regulation. The mechanisms of TEs evolution we observed in these prominent plant symbionts bear striking similarities to those of many filamentous plant pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

A key factor in their success is the ability to filter out erroneous k-mers by removing those with low abundances. However, large numbers of distinct k-mers make counting a memory-intensive step. Early tools addressed this issue by storing k-mers on disk. More recent solutions, mitigate the excessive redundancy of overlapping k-mers by partially reassembling them into super-k-mers. Nevertheless, consecutive super-k-mers still overlap by k - 1 bases, leading to some degree of inefficiency.

Here we present hyper-k-mers as an alternative, less redundant, representation of super-k-mers. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose hyper-k-mers, a new k-mer representation that asymptotically decreases duplication compared to super-k-mers. Second, we present a theoretical analysis comparing the space efficiency of super-k-mers, syncmers, and hyper-k-mers. Our approach offers significant advantages compared to super-k-mers, by reducing the asymptotic lower bound from 6 to 4 bits per nucleotide. Third, we present KFC, a k-mer counting algorithm leveraging hyper-k-mers. KFC offers significant practical advantages, including an order of magnitude improvement in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art tools. Notably, our experiments show that KFC is the only tool whose memory usage scales sub-linearly with k-mer size k, and is the fastest option when k is large.

To explore the potential evolutionary origins of the double cone, we analyzed single-cell and -nucleus transcriptomic atlases of photoreceptors from six vertebrate species: zebrafish, chicken, lizard, opossum, ground squirrel, and human. Computational analyses separated the principal and accessory members in chicken and lizard, identifying molecular signatures distinguishing either member from single cones and rods in the same species. Comparative transcriptomic analyses suggest that both the principal and accessory originated from ancestral red cones. Furthermore, the gene expression variation among cone subtypes mirrors their spectral order (red[-&gt;] green[-&gt;] blue[-&gt;] UV), suggesting a constraint in their order of emergence during evolution. Finally, we find that rods are equally dissimilar to all cone types, suggesting that they emerged before the spectral diversification of cones.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

However, the underlying mechanisms and disease relevance are not fully understood. We have recently identified RH1115 as a small molecule modulator of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway that regulates lysosome positioning in neurons. This allowed us to manipulate neuronal lysosome distribution including in axons and interrogate its contribution to both optimal neuronal functioning and to disease pathology. We demonstrate that the small molecule not only rescues aberrant buildup of both axonal autophagic and lysosomal intermediates but also reduces secreted A{beta}42 levels in human iPSC-derived neurons lacking the lysosomal adaptor, JIP3. We thus demonstrate that restoring efficient axonal lysosome transport has an anti-amyloidogenic effect in human neurons and is a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimers disease. Furthermore, we show that the small molecule enhances neuronal lysosome degradation, requires the lysosomal adaptor JIP4 to rescue the axonal lysosome pathology in the JIP3 KO neurons and increases levels of the JIP4-interacting lysosomal membrane protein, TMEM55B. Lastly, treatment with the small molecule led to a striking rescue of locomotor defects in JIP3 KO zebrafish larvae. Thus, we have identified a small molecule which can be impactful in neurodegenerative diseases that have a lysosomal pathology and have determined its molecular targets in modulating axonal lysosome abundance.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1731362955368

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from [~]0% to [~]20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from [~]0% to [~]8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from [~]2% to [~]9% from [~]5500 to [~]3000 years ago before dropping to [~]3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the ""Thrifty Gene"" hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Generally, experienced bullying showed increased subcortical volumes in the putamen ({beta}=0.12), caudate ({beta}=0.06), accumbens ({beta}=0.06), amygdala ({beta}=0.07), hippocampus ({beta}=0.06), paired with decreased cerebellar ({beta}=-0.10), entorhinal, ({beta}=-0.12), and insula ({beta}=-0.11) volumes. Females exhibited more volumetric changes in emotional processing areas whereas males had more changes in motor and sensory regions. These findings point to widespread associations between bullying victimization and brain development, offering a potential neurobiological framework to explain the emotional and behavioral difficulties observed. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for a sex-sensitive approach in future research and interventions related to bullying.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we aimed to create the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, and to test the efficacy of a candidate gene therapy to improve cardiac kinetics and correct the disease phenotype.

Methods and ResultsHealthy human pluripotent stem cell-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to bioengineer beating cardiac tissue strips and pumping cardiac chambers. When conditioned with transforming growth factor-{beta}1 and endothelin-1, these mini-heart models exhibited signature disease phenotypes of significantly elevated diastolic force and tissue stiffness, and slowed contraction and relaxation kinetics, with no significant deficit in systolic force or ejection fraction versus unconditioned controls. Bioinformatic analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from HFpEF mini-heart models and patient ventricular samples identified downregulation of SERCA2a of the calcium signalling pathway as a key differentially expressed gene. After dosage optimization, AAV-mediated expression of SERCA2a abrogated the disease phenotype and improved the cardiac kinetics in HFpEF mini-Hearts.

ConclusionsThese findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF, with Fast Track designation. We conclude that such human-based disease-specific mini-heart platforms are relevant for target discovery and validation that can facilitate clinical translation of novel cardiac therapies.

Translational PerspectiveHeart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a significant and growing global health concern lacking disease-modifying therapeutic options, reflecting inadequate preclinical models of the disease. Aligned with FDA Modernization Act 2.0, we created the first in vitro human-specific mini-heart models of HFpEF, demonstrated phenotypic disease characteristics of elevated stiffness and slowed kinetics, showed transcriptomic consistency with HFpEF patient data, identified SERCA2a as a key downregulated gene, performed dosing titration of SERCA2a gene therapy, and showed improvement of cardiac kinetics post-treatment. The findings contributed to FDA approval of an ongoing first-in-human gene therapy clinical trial for HFpEF.","NA","biorxiv",1731362955368

Animal studies have yielded rich insight into mechanisms for visual perception, but the neural mechanisms for visual imagery remain poorly understood. Here, we first determined that [~]80% of visually responsive single neurons in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) used a distributed axis code to represent objects. We then used that code to reconstruct objects and generate maximally effective synthetic stimuli. Finally, we recorded responses from the same neural population while subjects imagined specific objects and found that [~]40% of axis-tuned VTC neurons recapitulated the visual code. Our findings reveal that visual imagery is supported by reactivation of the same neurons involved in perception, providing single neuron evidence for existence of a generative model in human VTC.

We recently began to address these challenges by curating a large collection of cancer scRNA-seq datasets, and leveraging it for systematic analyses of tumor heterogeneity. Here we significantly extend this repository to 124 datasets for over 40 cancer types, together comprising 2,822 samples, with improved data annotations, visualisations and exploration.
