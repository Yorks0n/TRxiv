Large and heterogeneous samples are required to define generalizable links between brain development and psychopathology. To this end, we introduce the Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC), an open data resource that integrates data from 5 large studies of brain development in youth from three continents (N=6,346; 45% Female). Confirmatory bifactor models were used to create harmonized psychiatric phenotypes that capture major dimensions of psychopathology. Following rigorous quality assurance, neuroimaging data were carefully curated and processed using consistent pipelines in a reproducible manner with DataLad, the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC), and FreeSurfer. Initial analyses of RBC data emphasize the benefit of careful quality assurance and data harmonization in delineating developmental effects and associations with psychopathology. Critically, all RBC data - including harmonized psychiatric phenotypes, unprocessed images, and fully processed imaging derivatives - are openly shared without a data use agreement via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative. Together, RBC facilitates large-scale, reproducible, and generalizable research in developmental and psychiatric neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

The first cultured representatives revealed valuable insight3,4 but are distantly related to the first eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA), leaving many unknowns regarding this archaeon's biology. Here, we report isolation of two strains belonging to the order proposed as FECA's closest relative, 'Hodarchaeales',5 as members of a pure co- and tri-culture with methanogenic partners. Both are obligately anaerobic, syntrophic, peptide-degrading, and mesophilic archaea that have simple internal cell structure and produce protrusions and vesicles, like Promethearchaeales3,4. All strains demonstrate behavior focused on cell construction rather than division, unlike typical prokaryotes6. Strain HC1 possesses genes associated with aerobic lifestyles but lacks complete pathways for aerobic respiration and co-cultures cannot grow under (micro)aerobic conditions, suggesting the genes support oxygen detoxification rather than respiration. Reflecting this, HC1 can survive and grow under microaerobic conditions only when aerobic organisms are present. Phylogenetic analyses indicate FECA may have possessed these genes and thus some aerotolerance. Physiological, genomic, and phylogenetic observations indicate FECA was a simple-celled anaerobic syntrophic peptide-degrading archaeon with a non-growth-centric lifestyle and potential adaptations towards an oxygenated planet--the archaea-eukaryote transition was steep in both cell structure and aerobiosis.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740780510003

However, due to their limited genome size, viruses must adopt unique strategies to confront cellular sensors. Since emerging in humans, SARS-CoV-2 has accrued multiple mutations throughout its genome, some of which enhanced virus replication and led to the rise of viral variants. However, the biological consequences of many of these changes remain to be discovered. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 produces a truncated form of the nucleocapsid protein, called N*M210. Due to the acquisition of a viral transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) in the N gene, certain variants, such as Omicron, produce a new viral mRNA that markedly increases N*M210 expression. We show that N*M210 is a dsRNA binding protein, which inhibits multiple arms of the cellular antiviral response, including blocking interferon induction and inhibiting stress granule formation. We created a panel of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 viruses (rSARS-2) with mutations in the N gene that increased or decreased N*M210 production. We show that N*M210 production increases virus fitness, as viruses that produce more N*M210 outcompeted wild-type rSARS-2. We demonstrate that the fitness advantage provided by N*M210 is partly due to its ability to potently block stress granules. We propose a model where, to evade the cellular antiviral response, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a mechanism to increase the production of a truncated form of the N protein, which broadly limits the activation of dsRNA-induced antiviral responses, tipping the balance in favour of the virus in the battle for control of the cell.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Such protection is granted at the lysogenic state, where the phages persist as prophages integrated within the bacterial chromosome, expressing genes that defend the host and themselves from predation. Here, we report a prophage-encoded anti-phage defense system that inhibits DNA packaging of invading phages in Listeria monocytogenes. This system includes a defense protein, TerI, and two self-immunity proteins, anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2. TerI targets the terminase complex of invading phages to prevent DNA translocation into procapsids without halting the lytic cycle, leading to the release of unpacked non-infectious procapsids upon bacterial lysis. In contrast, the self-immunity proteins, anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2, counteract TerI during prophage induction to allow virion production. This unique prophage-encoded anti-phage defense system, TERi, is prevalent in Listeria phages, providing population-level host protection without compromising the prophage lytic lifecycle.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This new color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens new opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long term visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

While cryo-EM has revealed stable prefusion and postfusion conformations of the spike, the transient intermediate states during the fusion process have remained poorly understood. Here, we designed a near-native viral fusion system that recapitulates SARS-CoV-2 entry and used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to capture fusion intermediates leading to complete fusion. The spike protein undergoes extensive structural rearrangements, progressing through extended, partially folded, and fully folded intermediates prior to fusion-pore formation, a process that is dependent on protease cleavage and inhibited by the WS6 S2 antibody. Upon interaction with ACE2 receptor dimer, spikes cluster at membrane interfaces and following S2' cleavage concurrently transition to postfusion conformations encircling the hemifusion and pre-fusion pores in a distinct conical arrangement. Subtomogram averaging revealed that the WS6 S2 antibody binds to the spike's stem-helix, crosslinks and clusters prefusion spikes and inhibits refolding of fusion intermediates. These findings elucidate the complete process of spike-mediated fusion and SARS-CoV-2 entry, highlighting the neutralizing mechanism of S2-targeting antibodies.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Whether transient pockets formed within intrinsically disordered and unstructured regions of proteins can be selectively targeted with small molecules remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we developed a bespoke stereochemically-paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. Through this screen, we identified a hit covalent ligand KL2-236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC in vitro as pure MYC/MAX protein complex and in situ in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome-dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues. Notably, this reactivity was most pronounced for specific stereoisomers of KL2-236 with a diastereomer KL4-019 that was largely inactive. Mutagenesis of both C203 and D205 completely attenuated KL2-236-mediated MYC degradation. We have also optimized our initial KL2-236 hit compound to generate a more durable MYC degrader KL4-219A in cancer cells. Our results reveal a novel ligandable site within MYC and indicate that certain intrinsically disordered regions within high-value protein targets, such as MYC, can be interrogated by isomerically unique chiral small molecules, leading to destabilization and degradation.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Premature loss of chromosome cohesion proteins and untimely separation of chromosomes is thought to underly high rates egg aneuploidy during maternal aging. However, because chromosome cohesion loss occurs gradually over female reproductive lifespan and cytoskeletal defects alone can predispose eggs to chromosomal abnormalities, the root causes of exponential rise in egg aneuploidy at advanced reproductive ages remain a mystery. Here, we applied high-resolution live imaging to visualize for the first time cohesion protein dynamics underpinning meiotic chromosome segregation. To discover proteins whose dysfunction accelerates aneuploidies associated with female reproductive aging, we innovated the first experimental system in which chemically induced cohesion reduction rapidly triggers aging-like chromosomal abnormalities in young eggs. By integrating this direct cohesion manipulation system with quantitative high-resolution microscopy and targeted protein degradation tools, we identified the centromeric protein CENP-A as a new factor whose aging-like depletion causes a dramatic rise in premature separation of sister chromatids. Our work illuminates cohesion loss-independent origins of age-related egg aneuploidy and provides new avenues to discover therapeutic targets for extending the female reproductive lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Here, we address this issue by developing an integrated experimental and computational platform to collect large temporal imaging datasets that allow for the inference of 'digital twins' - mathematically precise computational models that accurately mirror the behavior of individual microorganisms - and show that they can replicate the light response of diverse microorganisms in silico. We show that a generalised phenomenological model of movement can be effectively parameterised from experimental data to capture key behavioural traits of two commonly studied photo-responsive microorganisms (Euglena gracilis and Volvox aureus) and demonstrate our model's ability to accurate reproduce patterns of movement for individuals and populations in response to dynamic and spatially varying light patterns.

We established a framework using two distinct microbiomes in the same soil that differently affect plant growth. Screening 410 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions revealed substantial variation in growth feedbacks, which we used for genome-wide association mapping to identify Mediator of Microbiome Feedback 1 (MMF1), an immune receptor. Characterisation in the reference accession Col-0 revealed that mmf1 mutants lack the differential growth feedbacks, have an altered root bacterial community, and fail to induce a defence-related transcriptional response observed in wild-type plants. The discovery of MMF1 implies that integration of microbial effector signals optimises host microbiome composition and immune status to enhance growth.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

By investigating the colonisation of Arabidopsis thaliana by the highly polyphagous peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae), we identified cell wall-derived DAMPs, specifically oligogalacturonides (OGs), as key in inducing DTI against aphids. The OG-responsive immune components BAK1/BKK1, CPK5/CPK6, GRP3, and EDS1 collectively contribute to DTI limiting aphid colonisation. We found that aphids limit OG production during feeding. Additionally, the salivary chemosensory protein (CSP) effector Mp10/CSP4, which is known to be delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells early in aphid attack, inhibits OG-induced DTI. While Mp10 suppresses OG-induced DTI, it also interacts with EDS1-mediated defences, enhancing aphid fecundity in the absence of EDS1 but restoring OG responsiveness under attack, revealing its broader role in immune modulation and effector-driven host adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded dsRNA or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

INs expressing the neuropeptide vasoactive-intestinal peptide (VIP) have attracted attention recently following the discovery that they predominantly function by inhibiting dendritic-targeting somatostatin (SST) expressing INs, thereby disinhibiting PCs. This VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit motif is observed throughout the neocortex from mice to humans, and serves as a key mechanism for top-down (feedback) and context-dependent information processing. Thus, VIP IN-mediated disinhibition has been found to play an important role in sensory processing, control of executive functions, attention, sensorimotor integration and other cortico-cortical and thalamocortical feedback interactions. Furthermore, VIP INs have been implicated in mediating the effects of reinforcement signals, both reward and aversive, via their responsiveness to neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (ACh), and in facilitating synaptic plasticity and learning. While it is evident from transcriptomic analyses that VIP INs are a molecularly heterogeneous group, the physiological significance of this diversity is unclear at present. Here, we have characterized the functional diversity of VIP INs in the primary somatosensory cortex by leveraging intersectional genetic approaches to study distinct VIP IN subtypes. We found that VIP INs can be divided into four different populations: a group that expresses the Ca2+-binding protein calretinin (CR), two distinct groups that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), and a group that does not express either CR or CCK (non-CCK non-CR; or nCCK nCR). VIP neurons in each group exhibit different laminar distributions, axonal and dendritic arbors, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and efferent connectivity, VIP/CR INs target almost exclusively SST INs, VIP/nCCK nCR INs also mainly target SST INs but also have connections to parvalbumin (PV) expressing INs. These two groups have essentially no connectivity to pyramidal cells (PCs). On the other hand, the two types of VIP/CCK INs target PCs, but differ in the degree to which synaptic release from each type is modulated by endocannabinoids. We also found that long-range inputs differentially recruit distinct VIP IN groups. Intriguingly, we find that distinct VIP IN populations target distinct SST INs subtypes in turn, indicating the presence of specialized VIP-SST disinhibitory subcircuits. Activation of distinct VIP IN subpopulations in vivo results in differential effects on the cortical network, thus providing evidence for modularity in VIP IN-mediated actions during cortical information processing.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

We show that 2'-deoxyribose inhibits nucleic acid phase separation and suppresses the intra-condensate networking transition, known as percolation, that underlies the condensate dynamical arrest. All-atom simulations reveal increased solvation and compaction of single-stranded DNA compared to RNA, suggesting an unintuitive role of chain flexibility in modulating heat induced nucleic acid phase separation and percolation transitions. Further, 2'-O-methylation (2'-O-Me) of RNA, a common sugar modification, lowers the driving force of RNA phase transitions. These results highlight the diverse physicochemical parameters governing nucleic acid phase behavior and suggest how sugar modifications may have evolved to robustly tune the formation and dynamical arrest of RNA condensates.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

We illustrate the power and potential of the MAP by addressing a series of fundamental questions. For example, we provide evidence that genome size in prokaryotes depends on a balance between deletion bias and the beneficial effects of additional genes. Moreover, we show that long-range and short-range linkage disequilibrium represent quite different features of evolutionary dynamics and contribute independently to genetic diversity. Notably, we show that as within-species diversity increases, selection becomes an increasingly strong force structuring diversity, for example creating convergent ecospecies structures in Streptococcus mitis and S. oralis.

Predicting these missing links is critical for many applications, including genome-wide association studies and phenotype prediction. Efforts have previously applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to this missing-link prediction problem, but these techniques too have limitations when the sparsity of the networks is very high. Here, we apply a novel feature engineering technique that uses local graph motif incidence to enhance the feature set for variational graph autoencoders (VGAE). We compare the performance of our technique against state-of-the-art approaches, and then progressively hide more and more of the original graph edges. Our results show that VGAEs with our local-area motif prevalence (LAMP) features outperform state-of-the-art node embeddings for a wide range of missing edges on both a benchmark and a biological dataset. We also observe that this combined VGAE and LAMP technique has the potential to facilitate the search for novel genetic interactions in an experimental adaptive sampling context with far fewer samples. Improvements to gene interaction imputation can lower the barrier to new pharmaceutical and epidemiological discoveries by revealing hidden gene interactions that steer the development of potential drug targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Recent progress in inference has made ARG-based approaches feasible across of range of applications, and many new methods using inferred ARGs as input have appeared. This progress on the long-standing problem of ARG inference has proceeded in two distinct directions. First, the Bayesian inference of ARGs under the Sequentially Markov Coalescent (SMC), is now practical for tens-to-hundreds of samples. Second, approximate models and heuristics can now scale to sample sizes two to three orders of magnitude larger. Although these heuristic methods are reasonably accurate under many metrics, one significant drawback is that the ARGs they estimate do not have the topological properties required to compute a likelihood under models such as the SMC under present-day formulations. In particular, heuristic inference methods typically do not estimate precise details about recombination events, which are currently required to compute a likelihood. In this paper we present a backwards-time formulation of the SMC and derive a straightforward definition of the likelihood of a general class of ARG under this model. We show that this formulation does not require precise details of recombination events to be estimated, and is robust to the presence of polytomies. We discuss the possibilities for inference that this opens.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

The production of functional eggs in sufficient numbers for a female lifespan requires dynamic and precisely coordinated cellular and developmental programs in early oogenesis. However, our understanding of their underlying regulatory mechanisms is critically lacking. Here, we aimed to identify overlooked essential regulators of early oogenesis in zebrafish. First, we present the establishment of a long-term ovary culture system which enables physiological oocyte development from oogonia to primordial follicles in cultured ovaries, providing an invaluable ex-vivo platform for rapid investigation. Next, we utilized this system for robust functional screening of candidates from stage-specific oocyte transcriptomic data. We identified mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin as novel regulators of oocyte polarity. By using a combination of genetics, pharmacological manipulations ex-vivo, and rescue experiments, we established an essential mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway that orchestrates centrosome regulation and microtubule organization to facilitate oocyte polarity. Microtubules control the localization and condensation of the essential polarity regulator Bucky ball (Buc). Loss of mTOR or Stat3 functions, as well as overactivation of Stathmin (a microtubule destabilizing protein) resulted in aberrant centrosome regulation and destabilization of microtubules, leading to dispersed mis-localized Buc condensates and loss of polarity. We show that mTOR acts upstream of Stat3 in oocytes, and that inhibition of Stathmin in stat3-/- or mTOR deficient ovaries rescued both cytoskeletal and polarity defects. We propose a novel mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway which through cytoskeletal regulation, provides oocytes with polarization competence, a step likely widely conserved in biology. mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin are known for their roles in cellular growth and cancer. Our work reveals their novel unpredicted functions in cell polarity during animal post-embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Importantly, MS and EAE differ in both their distribution of CNS lesions and their symptoms, indicating differences in CNS inflammation. MS lesions are more prevalent in the brain, while EAE lesions are more frequent in the spinal cord. Additionally, neurologic deficits in MS rarely parallel the paralysis typical for CD4 T cell-mediated EAE (CD4-EAE). In contrast, CD8-EAE models suggest that CD8 T cells preferentially cause brain inflammation, but little is known regarding how brain and spinal cord inflammation may differ, and how CD8 T cells may contribute to those differences.

However positive detection using existing probes has not been confirmed in some geographic regions where they would be expected. Here, we aimed to test whether mutations at key sites have been detrimental to species-specific detection of P. pristis (Linnaeus, 1758) using the existing probe set.

In particular, how QDR against a generalist necrotrophic pathogen evolved and whether it is driven by conserved or species-specific regulatory networks remains unclear. Here, we examined the transcriptomic responses of five diverse wild tomato species that span a gradient of QDR. We initially hypothesised that conserved regulatory modules might control QDR. Instead, we use differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find that species-specific regulatory features, encompassing both infection-induced and constitutively expressed genes, predominantly shape QDR levels. Although we identified an ethylene response factor among candidate genes for QDR-regulation, it did not fully account for the phenotypic variation. To further dissect the evolutionary basis of these regulatory patterns, we performed phylotranscriptomic analyses on gene regulatory networks. Notably, our findings reveal that the conserved NAC transcription factor 29 is pivotal in developing disease resistance only in S. pennellii. The differential regulation and altered downstream signalling pathways of NAC29 provide evidence for its co-option in the resistance mechanisms of S. pennellii. This finding highlights the species-specific rewiring of gene regulatory networks by repurposing a conserved regulatory element to enhance resistance against pathogens effectively. These results offer new insights into the evolutionary and regulatory complexity underlying QDR and emphasise the significance of species-specific gene regulation in shaping resistance against a cosmopolitan necrotrophic pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

In a second study, mnemonics-naive individuals underwent a 6-week-long memory training, working memory training, or no intervention. Results showed distinct neural representations in the prefrontal cortex, inferior temporal, and posterior parietal regions as memory athletes and the memory training group studied novel content. Neural representations were also distinct between these experienced individuals, which was related to better memory performance after 4 months.

We suggest that the method of loci may bolster memory uniqueness within ones ""memory palace"", setting the stage for exceptional memory performance.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

While hypotheses of VTA dopamine neuron function posit a homogenous role in behavior (e.g., prediction error), they do not account for molecular heterogeneity. We find that glutamate-dopamine, nonglutamate-dopamine, and glutamate-only neurons are dissociable in their signaling of reward and aversion-related stimuli, prediction error, and electrical properties. In addition, glutamate-dopamine and nonglutamate-dopamine neurons differ in dopamine release dynamics. Aversion-related recordings of all dopamine neurons (not considering glutamate co-transmission) showed a mixed response that obscured dopamine subpopulation function. Within glutamate-dopamine neurons, glutamate and dopamine release had dissociable contributions toward reward and aversion-based learning and performance. Based on our results, we propose a new hypothesis on VTA dopamine neuron function: that dopamine neuron signaling patterns and their roles in motivated behavior depend on whether or not they co-transmit dopamine with glutamate.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) inhabit heterogeneous environments, including the gastrointestinal tract of their host as adults and are excreted as eggs and larvae in faeces, complicating our understanding of their biology and the use of genetic tools for species monitoring and population tracking. We have developed a hybridisation capture approach to enrich mitochondrial genome sequences of two STH species, the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and whipworm Trichuris trichiura, from extracted DNA from faecal material and worm specimens. Employing ~1000 targeted probes, we achieved >6,000 and >12,000 fold enrichment for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, respectively, relative to direct whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. Sequencing coverage was highly concordant with probe targets and correlated with the number of eggs per gram (EPG) of parasites present, from which DNA from as few as 336 EPG for Ascaris and 48 EPG for Trichuris were efficiently captured and sufficient to provide effective mitochondrial genome data. Finally, allele frequencies were highly concordant between WGS and hybridisation capture, suggesting little genetic information is lost with additional sample processing required for enrichment. Our hybridisation capture design and approach enables sensitive and scalable STH mitochondrial genome sampling from faecal DNA extracts and paves the way for broader hybridisation capture-based genome-wide applications and molecular epidemiology studies of STHs.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Here we show that bacteria can mount a genome-wide, coordinated, and highly effective immune response against bacterial and viral threats using a single regulatory pathway. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that Pseudomonas species broadly possess a specialized form of the Gac/Rsm regulatory pathway (GRP), which our prior work in Pseudomonas aeruginosa implicated in activating interbacterial antagonism defense mechanisms in response to neighbor cell death. Proteomic studies comparing GRP-activated and -inactivated strains derived from diverse Pseudomonas species showed that the pathway regulates a large and variable suite of factors implicated in defense against both bacterial and phage threats. Focusing on P. protegens, we identify profound phenotypic consequences of these factors against multiple forms of bacterial antagonism and several phage. Together, our results reveal that bacteria, like more complex organisms, couple danger sensing to the activation of an immune system with antibacterial and antiviral arms.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

By contrast, many biological and environmental settings---ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet---feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially-uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner ""core"" that coexists with a more dilute, highly-motile surrounding ""shell"". By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use theory and simulations to develop quantitative principles describing this interplay---establishing a biophysical framework that unifies all our experimental observations. Our work thereby sheds new light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations, and other forms of chemically-reactive living and active matter, in confined environments, and provides a way to predict and control these behaviors more broadly.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

We leveraged these data to glean insights on participant recruitment, experimental design, and data acquisition that could be useful to consider for future studies. Across 766 awake infant fMRI sessions, we explored the factors that influenced how much usable data were obtained per session (average of 9 minutes). The age of an infant predicted whether they would successfully enter the scanner (younger was more likely) and, if they did enter, the number of minutes of functional data retained after preprocessing. The amount of functional data retained was also influenced by assigned sex (female more), experimental paradigm (movies better than blocks and events), and stimulus content (social better than abstract). In addition, we assessed the value of attempting to collect multiple experiments per session, an approach that yielded more than one usable experiment averaging across all sessions (including those with no data). Although any given scan is unpredictable, these findings support the feasibility of awake infant fMRI and suggest practices to optimize future research.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Unbiased analyses of IDRome-spanning grammars reveals that specialized IDR grammar features direct biological processes, cellular localization preferences, and molecular functions. IDRs with exceptional grammars, defined as sequences with high-scoring non-random features, are harbored in proteins and complexes that enable spatial and temporal sorting of biochemical activities. Protein complexes within the nucleus recruit specific factors through top-scoring IDRs. These IDRs are frequently disrupted via cancer-associated mutations and fusion oncoproteins. Overall, GIN enables the decoding of sequence-function relationships of IDRs and can be deployed in IDR-specific and IDRome-wide analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Previous work has shown that training animals with a paradigm involving heat and isoamyl alcohol (IAA) simultaneously, causes C. elegans to lose their attraction to IAA. In this study, we elaborate on the mechanism behind this LTAM formation and suggest that during training with heat and IAA, C. elegans release extracellular vesicles (EVs) that upon being taken up by the same trained animals or their untrained counterparts causes the organism to lose attraction to IAA. Our data suggests that the vesicles are highly specific to the training paradigms used and differ with differing cues.

Path2Omics was trained on 20,497 slides (a combination of 9,456 formalin fixed (FFPE) and 11,041 fresh frozen (FF)) from 8,007 patients across 23 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. When tested on FFPE slides, which are the most readily available in the clinical pathology practice from 15 TCGA cohorts, the integrated Path2Omics model outperformed its individual FF and FFPE trained components, achieving an average of nearly 5,000 genes whose expression is robustly inferred, approximately five times higher than our recently published DeepPT approach, the top extant prediction transcriptomics inference model. Externally evaluated on seven unseen independent patient cohorts, Path2Omics successfully robustly predicted the expression of about 4,400 genes, yielding a 30% increase over the performance of the FFPE model alone. Finally, we demonstrate that inferred gene expression and methylation using Path2Omics is as effective as the actual expression values for further predicting patient survival and treatment response.

Here, we used whole-genome sequence (WGS) data in 672,976 individuals of diverse ancestry to evaluate the contribution and architecture of rare non-coding variants to three commonly studied anthropometric traits: height, body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Analysing 447,461 individuals in UK Biobank for discovery and 225,515 individuals in All of Us for replication, we identified 90 novel rare and low-frequency single variant associations. This includes two independent rare variants upstream of IGF2BP2 that both substantially reduce WHRadjBMI, but have distinct effects on other adiposity traits. We identified 135 coding variant aggregates, several of which were missed by exome sequencing studies. For example, UBR3 protein-truncating variants were associated with a 2.7kg/m2 increase in BMI. We additionally identified 51 non-coding variant aggregate associations, including in the 5UTR of FGF18 (a highly constrained gene with no previously reported coding associations) associated with up to 6cm effects on height. We show that 97% of rare variant associations occur near GWAS loci demonstrating convergence of rare and common variant associations. Finally, we show that ultra rare variants (MAF<0.01%) explain a small fraction of heritability (<10%) compared to common variants for these traits, that heritability is largely shared across ancestries, and that this heritability is concentrated at or near common variant loci. Our work demonstrates the importance of large-scale WGS for fully understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Actin filaments are continuously displaced from cell periphery, where they assemble, towards the cells center, where they disassemble. Despite this constant flow and turnover, cellular networks maintain their overall architecture constant. How such a flow of material can support dynamic yet steady cellular architectures remains an open question. To investigate the role of myosin-based forces in contractile steady-states of actin networks, we used a reconstituted in vitro system based on a minimal set of purified proteins, namely actin, myosin and actin regulators. We found that, contrary to previous bulk experiments, when confined in microwells, the actin network could self-organize into ordered arrangements of contractile bundles, flowing continuously without collapsing. This was supported by three-dimensional fluxes of actin filaments, spatially separated yet balancing each other. Unexpectedly, maintaining these fluxes did not depend on filament nucleation or elongation, but solely on filament transport. Ablation of the contractile bundles abolished the flux balance and led to network collapse. These findings demonstrate that the dynamic steady state of actin networks can be sustained by filament displacement and recirculation, independently of filament assembly and disassembly.

Significance StatementCellular structures continuously self-renew, with new material constantly being added and removed while maintaining overall structural stability. This is particularly true for the actin cytoskeleton, whose components are continuously assembled, displaced, and reassembled. Understanding this process is fundamental to uncovering how cells regulate their architecture and adapt to stimuli.

Here, we reconstitute an in vitro actomyosin network capable of contracting steadily over time without collapsing, relying solely on myosin-based transport. These findings demonstrate that a minimal system consisting of actin and molecular motors can effectively recapitulate the ability of actin networks to self-organize into stable yet dynamic architectures.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Within the NRC (NLR Required for Cell Death) network, NLRs operate in complex sensor-helper configurations to confer immunity against a diverse array of pathogens, particularly in Asterids. While helper NLRs are typically conserved and evolve slowly, sensor NLRs tend to evolve more rapidly. However, the functional connections between slow and fast-evolving NLRs remain poorly understood, notably in important crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis of NLRs across 40 Solanales and 29 Asterales genomes to explore NRC network expansion and diversification within the less-studied Asterales order. Our findings reveal that the NRC network has expanded less in Asterales compared to Solanales. We functionally validated a minimal Asterales NRC network with 2 helpers and 9 sensors in common lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Through selection and diversification analysis and structural modeling of NRC helper and sensor subclades in the Lactuca genus, we found varying evolutionary diversification rates between NRC helpers and sensors. We found a correlation between sensor diversification rates and helper dependency, with sensors reliant on a phylogenetically conserved helpers experiencing limited diversification pressure.

Here we explored whether networks could be precisely estimated solely using data acquired during active task paradigms. The straightforward strategy involved extracting residualized data after application of a task-based general linear model (GLM) and then applying standard functional connectivity analysis. Functional correlation matrices estimated from task data were highly similar to those derived from traditional resting-state fixation data. The largest factor affecting similarity between correlation matrices was the amount of data. Networks estimated within-individual from task data displayed strong spatial overlap with those estimated from resting-state fixation data and predicted the same triple functional dissociation in independent data. The implications of these findings are that (1) existing task data can be reanalyzed to estimate within-individual network organization, (2) restingstate fixation and task data can be pooled to increase statistical power, and (3) future studies can exclusively acquire task data to both estimate networks and extract task responses. Most broadly, the present results suggest that there is an underlying, stable network architecture that is idiosyncratic to the individual and persists across task states.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Here, we identify a family of Cryptosporidium virulence factors that are exported into the host cell during infection and localise to the microvilli. We examine the trafficking and function of the most highly expressed family member, MVP1, which appears to control the elongation of microvilli through engagement of host EBP50 and CDC42. Remarkably, this mechanism closely mirrors that of an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli virulence factor, MAP, which is also known to drive host microvilli elongation during infection.

Here, we describe its recent arrival into the Indian Ocean sub-Antarctic archipelagos of Crozet and Kerguelen, where we first detected the virus in October 2024 in dead southern elephant seals, king penguins, gentoo penguins, brown skuas and kelp gulls. While the panzootic is ongoing, it has already caused unprecedented and alarming mortalities of southern elephant seals. We collected brain swabs from various seal and bird carcasses, subsequently isolated the virus and obtained 25 novel HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b sequences. Our phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses show that there have been independent introductions of the virus to Crozet and Kerguelen, from the distant South Georgia Islands in the Southern Atlantic, and not from the more nearby coasts of South Africa. Our results point to a year-long gap in genomic surveillance in the south polar region, obscuring how HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b is spreading in the sub-Antarctic and illustrating the difficulties in tracking pathogen dispersal in the region. Locally, our phylogenetic analyses show that the virus is transmitted between different species. Moreover, our serological analyses show that some southern elephant seal pups had mounted an anti-H5 antibody response. With the spread to Crozet and Kerguelen, HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b is moving ever closer to Australia and New Zealand, which currently remain free from infections with this strain, and represents a major threat to the sub-Antarctic wildlife. Our results provide key elements to enable stakeholders to anticipate the arrival and spread of the virus in remote areas of critical wildlife conservation concerns.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Since the influenza virus causes respiratory infections in humans, developing mucosal vaccines to protect the entry site of the virus is of high importance. Recombinant NA requires adjuvants to induce a protective immune response after mucosal administration. In the current study, we analyze the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant NA-based influenza virus vaccine administered intranasally in combination with adjuvants consisting of outer membrane proteins from Neisseria meningitidis complexed with exogenous lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Shigella flexneri or endogenous LPS from N. meningitidis. We evaluated the local and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses to adjuvanted recombinant N1 NA, analyzing the dynamics of local follicular T-helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center B cells (GCB) in nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and tissue-resident memory T cells in lungs, as well as the levels of IgA and IgG in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Finally, we performed a heterologous challenge study to test the ability of the investigated vaccine formulations to induce cross-protection. The study demonstrates that bacterial cell membrane-derived adjuvants significantly improve the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the recombinant N1 NA-based influenza vaccine leading to protection against clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 challenge. This finding supports the potential of these adjuvanted vaccines in providing effective mucosal immunity against influenza virus.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Explicit and implicit learning systems, usually linked to the hippocampus and striatum, can compete during learning, but whether they continue to interact during offline periods remains unclear. Here, we investigate for feedback-driven classification learning, whether sleep integrates explicit and implicit aspects of memory. The negative relationship between implicit and explicit memory components was resolved over sleep, but not wakefulness. Additionally, sleep benefitted performance on a task that allows the cooperative use of explicit and implicit memory, and participants who slept showed superior performance in generalizing their knowledge to unseen exemplars. A reinforcement learning model relates this to better transfer of the learned exemplar value representation after sleep. This suggests that sleep integrates information learned by different routes and helps us respond optimally to everyday life contingencies.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

She was a Caucasian woman born on March 4th 1907 in San Francisco, USA, from Spanish parents and settled in Spain since she was 8. A timeline of her life events and her genealogical tree are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a-b. Although centenarians are becoming more common in the demographics of human populations, the so-called supercentenarians (over 110 years old) are still a rarity. In Catalonia, the historic nation where M116 lived, the life-expectancy for women is 86 years, so she exceeded the average by more than 30 years (https://www.idescat.cat). In a similar manner to premature aging syndromes, such as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria and Werner syndrome, which can provide relevant clues about the mechanisms of aging, the study of supercentenarians might also shed light on the pathways involved in lifespan. To unfold the biological properties exhibited by such a remarkable human being, we developed a comprehensive multiomics analysis of her genomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic, microbiomic and epigenomic landscapes in different tissues, as depicted in Fig. 1a, comparing the results with those observed in non-supercentenarian populations. The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level.

Compositional theories propose that cognitive processes in neural network rely on shared components that can be reused to support different behaviors. However, previous studies have suggested that working memory components are task specific, challenging this framework. Here, we revisit this question using a population-based approach. We recorded neural activity in macaque monkeys performing two spatial working memory tasks with opposing goals: one requiring movement toward previously presented spatial locations (look task) and the other requiring avoidance of those locations (no-look task). Despite differences in task demands, we found that spatial memory representations were largely conserved at the population level, with a common low-dimensional neural subspace encoding memory across both tasks. In parallel, task identity was encoded in an orthogonal subspace, providing a stable and independent representation of contextual information. These results provide neural evidence for a compositional model of working memory, where representational geometry enables the efficient and flexible reuse of mnemonic codes across behavioral contexts while maintaining an independent representation of context.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

However, the link between structural changes and neuroinflammation is not well understood. In this study, we used operant conditioning to induce morphine self-administration in rats and examined brain volume and cellular changes, focusing on microglial phenotypes. Male Wistar rats were conditioned to morphine self-administration (0.01 mg/kg) for 20 days under a fixed-ratio 1 schedule. In vivo structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans were conducted at the beginning and end of self-administration. Brains were stained for Iba1 and NeuN proteins, and confocal images were analyzed for cell counts and microglial morphology. We used Deformation-Based Morphometry for MRI volume analysis and Principal Component Analysis with K-means clustering for microglial phenotyping. Our results showed that morphine self-administration led to volume changes in addiction-related brain regions, including increased globus pallidus and decreased insular cortex volume. Additionally, morphine caused widespread neuroinflammation, evidenced by elevated microglial density in the caudate-putamen, dentate gyrus, globus pallidus, and insular cortex, without affecting neuron counts. Finally, we observed region-specific variations in microglial phenotypes, suggesting region-specific neuroinflammatory roles. In conclusion, our study shows that morphine self-administration induces structural and microglial changes in addiction-related brain regions without neuronal loss, highlighting the role of neuroinflammation in opioid-induced adaptations. The variability in microglial phenotypes underscores their complexity, emphasizing the need to study their progression in addiction and their potential as therapeutic targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

Although highly conserved throughout many eukaryotes, their functions vary across species. In Aspergillus fumigatus, the etiological agent of invasive aspergillosis, septins participate in a variety of processes such as cell wall organization of conidia, septation, and response to cell wall stress. Previous studies determined that the {Delta}aspB strain had a greater sensitivity to anti-cell wall drugs, especially the echinocandin caspofungin, yet mechanisms behind this augmented sensitivity are unknown. We performed cell viability staining of the deletion strains post-caspofungin exposure and found that the {Delta}aspA, {Delta}aspB, and {Delta}aspC strains have significantly lower cell viability. Concomitant with the reduced viability, deletion strains are more susceptible to caspofungin on solid media. These results indicate that the septin cytoskeleton is important for A. fumigatus survival in the presence of caspofungin. Due to the potential of improved therapeutic outcome, we followed up using a neutropenic murine model of invasive aspergillosis. Animals infected with the {Delta}aspB strain and treated with caspofungin showed improved survival compared to the animals infected with akuBKU80 wild-type or complemented strains. Additionally, histological analysis showed reduced fungal burden and inflammation in the {Delta}aspB infected, caspofungin-treated group. Affinity purification coupled with quantitative proteomics identified proteins involved in the septin-dependent response to caspofungin, includng four candidate interactors involved in cell wall stress response. Deletion of these candidate genes resulted in increased susceptibility to caspofungin and moderately reduced viability post-drug exposure. Taken together, these data suggest that septin AspB contributes to the fungistatic response to caspofungin.

Author SummaryInvasive aspergillosis is a pulmonary disease caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus that primarily occurs in immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis has a high mortality rate, ranging from 50-90%. Therapy options are limited due to few available drugs with fungicidal activity and growing global drug resistance. Treatment typically starts with triazoles, which target the fungal cell membrane. If unsuccessful, an echinocandin, which targets the cell wall, is given as a salvage therapy. Echinocandins, including caspofungin, are fungistatic against A. fumigatus, slowing growth of the fungus rather than killing it. Due to this, echinocandins have a high therapeutic failure rate. Previous work suggests that deletion of the cytoskeletal septin genes increases sensitivity to caspofungin. Here we describe our finding that the septin genes aspA, aspB, and aspC are involved in the fungal response to caspofungin. Additionally, the deletion of aspB results in fungicidal activity of this otherwise fungistatic drug. These findings show promise for novel therapy options that block the septin-mediated response to caspofungin.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

The development of implantable devices with sensing capabilities is revolutionizing the study and treatment of brain circuits. However, it is unknown whether these devices can decode natural movement state from recorded neural activity or accurately classify states in real-time using onboard algorithms. Here, using a totally implanted bidirectional neurostimulator to perform long-term, at-home recordings from the motor cortex and pallidum of four subjects with Parkinsons disease, we successfully identified highly sensitive and specific personalized signatures of gait state, as determined by wearable sensors. Additionally, we demonstrated the feasibility of using these neural biomarkers to drive adaptive stimulation with the classifier embedded onboard the neurostimulator.

Attempts to classify inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subphenotypes to inform clinical decision making have been limited. We aimed to describe the latent disease heterogeneity by modelling routinely collected faecal calprotectin (FC) and CRP data, describing dynamic longitudinal inflammatory patterns in IBD.

MethodsIn this longitudinal study, we analysed patient-level post-diagnosis measurements of FC and CRP in two European cohorts. Latent class mixed models were used to cluster individuals with similar longitudinal profiles. Associations between cluster assignment and baseline characteristics were quantified using multinomial logistic regression. Differences in advanced therapy use across clusters were also explored. Finally, we considered uncertainty in cluster assignments with respect to follow-up length and the overlap between FC and CRP clusters. We included 1036 patients in the FC discovery analysis (Lothian) with a total of 10545 FC observations (median 9 per subject, IQR 6-13), and 7880 patients in the replication (Denmark). The CRP discovery analysis consisted of 1838 patients with 49364 measurements (median 20 per subject; IQR 10-36), with 10041 patients in the replication cohort.

FindingsEight distinct clusters of inflammatory behaviour over time were identified in the FC and CRP analysis for the Scottish cohort. This model was then applied to the Danish replication cohort, with similar patterns observed in both the Scottish and Danish populations. The clusters, FC1-8 and CRP1-8, were ordered from the lowest cumulative inflammatory burden to the highest. The clusters included groups with high diagnostic levels of inflammation which rapidly normalised, groups where high inflammation levels persisted throughout the full seven years of observation, and a series of intermediates including delayed remitters and relapsing remitters. CD and UC patients were unevenly distributed across the clusters. In UC, male sex was associated with the poorest prognostic cluster (FC8). The use and timing of advanced therapy was associated with cluster assignment, with the highest use of early advanced therapy in FC1. Of note, FC8 and CRP8 captured consistently high patterns of inflammation despite a high proportion of patients receiving advanced therapy, particularly for CD individuals. We observed that uncertainty in cluster assignments was higher for individuals with short longitudinal follow-up, particularly between clusters capturing similar earlier inflammation patterns. There was broadly poor agreement between FC and CRP clusters in keeping with the need to monitor both in clinical practice.

InterpretationDistinct patterns of inflammatory behaviour over time are evident in patients with IBD. Cluster assignment is associated with disease type and both the use and timing of advanced therapy. These data pave the way for a deeper understanding of disease heterogeneity in IBD and enhanced patient stratification in the clinic.","NA","medrxiv",1740780510003

However, the biological meaning of those gene sets has been interpreted anecdotally through over-representation analysis against canonical annotation databases of limited complexity, granularity, and accuracy. Rich functional descriptions of individual genes in an immunological context exist in the literature but are not semantically summarized to perform gene set analysis. To overcome this limitation, we constructed immune cell knowledge graphs (ICKGs) by integrating over 24,000 published abstracts from recent literature using large language models (LLMs). ICKGs effectively integrate knowledge across individual, peer-reviewed studies, enabling accurate, verifiable graph-based reasoning. We validated the quality of ICKGs using functional omics data obtained independently from cytokine stimulation, CRISPR gene knock-out, and protein-protein interaction experiments. Using ICKGs, we achieved rich, holistic, and accurate annotation of immunological gene sets, including those that were unannotated by existing approaches and those that are in use for clinical applications. We created an interactive website (https://kchen-lab.github.io/immune-knowledgegraph.github.io/) to perform ICKG-based gene set annotations and visualize the supporting rationale.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

This technique exploits incidental variability in brain lesion and brain stimulation locations, which creates a natural experiment in which causal inferences can be drawn between lesions or modulation of specific circuits and specific clinical outcomes. Circuits identified by causal network mapping, referred to as symptom-networks, represent candidate disorder/symptom-specific brain stimulation targets. The number of psychiatric symptom-networks has grown rapidly in recent years, creating a need for a comprehensive synthesis. To address this gap, this Resource presents an atlas of 12 psychiatric symptom-network targets and appraises them using an established evaluative framework. We describe how these targets can be localized with and without neuroimaging and highlight key considerations surrounding their trialing and implementation. These materials are designed to spur the translation of symptom-network targets and scaffold advancements in this quickly developing field.","NA","medrxiv",1740780510003

As implementation of faster gradients has facilitated higher sample throughput, mass spectrometers must adapt to shorter analysis times by enhancing scanning speed and sensitivity. For Orbitrap mass spectrometers, faster scan rates are constrained by the need for sufficient ion accumulation time, particularly given limitations on duty cycle at high repetition rate, and transient length, which determines analyzer sensitivity and resolving power. In this context, implementing alternative ion scheduling and better ion signal-processing strategies are needed to unleash the speed of these instruments. Here, we introduce a new scanning strategy termed pre-accumulation, which enables the storage of ions in the bent flatapole in parallel to the operation of the C-trap/IRM, leading to a significant improvement in ion beam utilization and enabling for the first time scanning speeds of >70 Hz on hybrid Orbitrap instruments. The combination of pre-accumulation and increased scan speeds notably enhances peptide and protein group identifications for short LC gradients and improves sensitivity for high-throughput applications. These benefits were further amplified when coupled with the full mass range phase-constrained spectrum deconvolution method ({Phi}SDM), especially for fast, lower-resolving Orbitrap measurements used with short LC gradients. Overall, we demonstrate that pre-accumulation of ions in the bent flatapole offers distinct advantages, particularly for conditions with reduced signal input. Since no hardware changes are required, this approach is highly attractive for Orbitrap mass spectrometers operated with fast MS/MS acquisition methods.","NA","biorxiv",1740780510003

We conducted an integrated analysis that combines electrophysiological and transcriptomic profiling, along with machine learning, of islet cells from T1D donors to investigate the mechanisms underlying their dysfunction. Surviving {beta}-cells exhibit altered electrophysiological properties and transcriptomic signatures indicative of increased antigen presentation, metabolic reprogramming, and impaired protein translation. In -cells, we observed hyper-responsiveness and increased exocytosis, which are associated with upregulated immune signaling, disrupted transcription factor localization and lysosome homeostasis, as well as dysregulation of mTORC1 complex signaling. Notably, key genetic risk signals for T1D were enriched in transcripts related to -cell dysfunction, including MHC class I which were closely linked with -cell dysfunction. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular underpinnings of islet cell dysfunction in T1D, highlighting pathways that may be leveraged to preserve residual {beta}-cell function and modulate -cell activity. These findings underscore the complex interplay between immune signaling, metabolic stress, and cellular identity in shaping islet cell phenotypes in T1D.
