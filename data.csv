Here we integrated published human metagenomic data of SARS-CoV-2 and developed a novel algorithm named as RedeCoronaVS to systematically dissect SARS-CoV-2 shedding modes with single-cell data as reference. We identify that SARS-CoV-2 particles are the dominant mode of viral shedding in the very early infection phase ([&le;]24 hours after hospitalization). Within the first week after hospitalization, SARS-CoV-2 replicons within host cells dominate SARS-CoV-2 shedding together with viral particles. One week later, viral fragments become the dominant mode in patients with mild or moderate symptoms, but viral replicons still dominate in some patients with severe symptoms. In addition to epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 replicons in neutrophils, macrophages, and plasma cells also show important roles and are associate with sampling time and disease severity.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

This paper investigates the role of the thalamus, a crucial subcortical structure, in orchestrating these opposing dynamics in the cerebral cortex. Through two distinct classes of cortical projections, the thalamus is able to support distinct dynamics modes: some cells relay precise information between cortical regions, whereas others diffusely modulate ongoing cortical dynamics. Traditional approaches to analysing neural data struggle to capture the moment-to-moment intricacies of brain dynamics, akin to mapping a rivers topography without understanding its flow, or laminarity. Inspired by the field of fluid dynamics, we show that spontaneous fMRI data exhibits non-trivial fluctuations in laminarity. Propofol-induced anesthesia selectively disrupts the non-laminar aspects of cortical dynamics while preserving laminar flow, which we validate with a large-scale biophysical model of the thalamocortical system. Finally, we confirmed theoretical predictions from the biophysical model using multielectrode electrophysiological recordings from the cerebral cortex of an anesthetized macaque - direct stimulation of the diffusely-projecting thalamus restored non-laminar cortical fluctuations and the waking state. We conclude that the thalamus provides versatile control over the cortical laminar and non-laminar flows that characterize conscious states.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Here, we use MENSA, Media Enriched with Newly Synthesized Antibodies, secreted exclusively from circulating human plasmablasts, to provide an immune snapshot that defines the underlying viral triggers. We provide proof-of-concept testing that the MENSA technology can capture the new host immune response to accurately diagnose acute primary and breakthrough infections when known SARS2 virus or proteins are present. It is also positive after vaccination when spike proteins elicit an acute immune response. Applying the same principles for long-COVID patients, MENSA is positive for SARS2 in 40% of PASC vs none of the COVID recovered (CR) patients without any sequelae demonstrating ongoing SARS2 viral inflammation only in PASC. Additionally, in PASC patients, MENSAs are also positive for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in 37%, Human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in 23%, and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) in 15% compared to 17%, 4%, and 4% in CR controls respectively. Combined, a total of 60% of PASC patients have a positive MENSA for SARS2, EBV, CMV, and/or HSV2. MENSA offers a unique antibody snapshot to reveal the underlying viral drivers in long-COVID thus demonstrating the persistence of SARS2 and reactivation of viral herpes in 60% of PASC patients.

MethodsA total of 7361 asymptomatic community-dwelling people enrolled in the Test Us at Home parent study between October 2021 and February 2022. Participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing every 24-48 hours for 10-14 days, regardless of symptom or infection status. Participants who had no history of COVID-19 at enrollment and who were subsequently found to have [&ge;]1 positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the parent study were recontacted in August 2023 and asked whether they had experienced long COVID, defined as the development of new symptoms lasting 3 months or longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads, and slopes of viral clearance were modeled using post-nadir viral loads. Using a log binomial model with the modeled slopes as the exposure, we calculated the relative risk of subsequently developing long COVID with 1-2 symptoms, 3-4 symptoms, or 5+ symptoms, adjusting for age, number of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of individual long COVID symptoms based on viral clearance was also calculated.

Results172 participants were eligible for analyses, and 59 (34.3%) reported experiencing long COVID. The risk of long COVID with 3-4 symptoms and 5+ symptoms increased by 2.44 times (aRR: 2.44; 95% CI: 0.88-6.82) and 4.97 times (aRR: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.90-13.0) per viral load slope-unit increase, respectively. Participants who developed long COVID had significantly longer times from peak viral load to viral clearance during acute disease than those who never developed long COVID (8.65 [95% CI: 8.28-9.01] vs. 10.0 [95% CI: 9.25-10.8]). The slope of viral clearance was significantly positively associated with long COVID symptoms of fatigue (aRR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.22-6.69), brain fog (aRR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.21-11.0), shortness of breath (aRR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.24-20.6), and gastrointestinal symptoms (aRR: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.54-19.3).

DiscussionWe observed that longer time from peak viral load to viral RNA clearance during acute COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. Further, slower clearance rates were associated with greater number of symptoms of long COVID. These findings suggest that early viral-host dynamics are mechanistically important in the subsequent development of long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1720649178791

We crowd-sourced ball python shed skin from commercial breeders and applied a case-control study design. Using whole-genome pool sequencing (pool-seq) and variant annotation, we found a premature stop codon in GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (gch1) associated with the axanthic phenotype. The enzyme GCH1 plays a key role in pterin pigment biosynthesis as well as neurochemistry, catalyzing the first rate-limiting step of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) biosynthesis. Our work provides the first identification of an axanthism-associated gene in vertebrates and highlights the utility of ball pythons as a model system to study pterin-based pigmentation.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

In plants, the transport of cellular organelles to pathogen penetration sites and their assembly around the host membrane delineating plant-pathogen interface are well-documented. However, whether organelles associate with these specialized plant-pathogen membrane interfaces and the extent to which this process contributes to immunity remain unknown. Here, we discovered defense-related membrane contact sites (MCS) comprising a membrane tethering complex between chloroplasts and the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) surrounding the pathogen haustorium. The assembly of this membrane tethering complex relies on the association between the chloroplast outer envelope protein CHLOROPLAST UNUSUAL POSITIONING 1 (CHUP1), and its plasma membrane-associated partner, KINESIN-LIKE PROTEIN FOR ACTIN-BASED CHLOROPLAST MOVEMENT 1 (KAC1). Our biochemical assays revealed that CHUP1 and KAC1 interact, while infection cell biology demonstrated their co-accumulation in foci where chloroplasts contact the EHM. Genetic depletion of CHUP1 or KAC1 reduces the deposition of callose-a cell wall material typically deployed to fortify pathogen penetration resistance-around the haustorium, without affecting other core immune processes. Our findings suggest that the chloroplast-EHM attachment complex positively regulates plant focal immunity, revealing the key components and their potential roles in the targeted deposition of defense components at the pathogen interface. These results advance our understanding of organelle-mediated immune responses and highlight the significance of MCS in plant-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

However, our understanding of how the pre-cancer microenvironment contributes to early tumorigenesis remains limited. Here, we show that newly emerging tumours at their most incipient stages shape their microenvironment in a critical process that determines their survival. Analysis of nascent squamous tumours in the upper gastrointestinal tract of the mouse reveals that the stress response of early tumour cells instructs the underlying mesenchyme to form a supportive ""pre-cancer niche"", which dictates the long-term outcome of epithelial lesions. Stimulated fibroblasts beneath emerging tumours activate a wound healing response that triggers a dramatic remodelling of the underlying extracellular matrix, resulting in the formation of a fibronectin-rich stromal scaffold that promotes tumour growth. Functional heterotypic 3D culture assays and in vivo grafting experiments, combining carcinogen-free healthy epithelium and tumour-derived stroma, demonstrate that the pre-cancerous niche alone is sufficient to confer tumour properties to healthy epithelial cells. We propose a model where both mutations and the stromal response to genetic stress defines the likelihood of early tumours to survive and progress towards more advanced disease stages.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

We identified voxel patterns in the lateral prefrontal cortex that predicted perceived uniformity, which could also generalize to scene uniformity in naturalistic movies. Because similar representations of visual uniformity can also be found in the intermediate and late layers of a feedforward convolutional neural network, the perception of uniformity may involve high-level coding of abstract properties of the entire scene as a whole, that is distinct from the filling-in of specific details in early visual areas.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Applied to SARS-CoV-2s spike protein we demonstrate the PLM, ESM-2, has learned the sequence context within which variation occurs, capturing evolutionary constraint. We demonstrate this recapitulates what conventionally requires MSA data predicting both where variation does and does not accumulate across the protein. We show the PLM-derived measures of amino acid change represent novel metrics as they do not correlate strongly with classical metrics of change in sequences. Applied to SARS-CoV-2 variants across the pandemic we demonstrate that ESM-2 representations encode the relatedness between variants, i.e., their evolutionary history, as well as the distinct nature of variants of concern upon their emergence, associated with shifts in receptor binding and antigenicity. This application of ESM-2 can be used for characterising the evolutionary potential and possible epidemiological impact of both existing and emerging variation, with the potential to be applied to any protein sequence, pathogen or otherwise.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

High mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to the emergence of highly transmissible variants efficiently evading vaccine-induced immunity. This highlights the importance of identifying broadly neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. In this study, we used a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to identify a subset that bound and neutralized a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intranasal delivery of XR10, the most promising murine mAb, protected hamsters against infection by Alpha and Delta variants. We next humanized XR10 mAb using a combination of CDR-grafting and Vernier zones preservation approaches (CRVZ) to create a panel of humanized antibody variants. We ranked the variants based on their spike binding ability and virus neutralization. Of these, XR10v48 demonstrated the best ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants.

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role.

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

ResultsGeometrical gene expression signature analysis demonstrated high utility to detect sub-groups with enhanced treatment response. In the Pfizer trial, gene expression signatures were able to detect three subgroups of responders (p = 0.012), containing 52.9% of patients and accounting for nearly all the observed treatment effect. Standard techniques following a similar methodology were able to partition a single subgroup containing 21.3% of patients.

These protrusions are organized by different actin nucleation promoting factors. For example, N-WASP controls finger-like filopodia, whereas the WAVE complex controls sheet-like lamellipodia. These different membrane morphologies likely reflect different patterns of nucleator self-organization. N-WASP phase separation has been successfully studied through biochemical reconstitutions, but how the WAVE complex self-organizes to instruct lamellipodia is unknown. Because WAVE complex self-organization has proven refractory to cell-free studies, we leverage in vivo biochemical approaches to investigate WAVE complex organization within its native cellular context. With single molecule tracking and molecular counting, we show that the WAVE complex forms highly regular multi-layered linear arrays at the plasma membrane that are rem-iniscent of a microtubule-like organization. Similar to the organization of microtubule protofilaments in a curved array, membrane curvature is both necessary and sufficient for formation of these WAVE complex linear arrays, though actin polymerization is not. This dependency on negative membrane curvature could explain both the templating of lamellipodia and their emergent behaviors, including barrier avoidance. Our data uncover the key biophysical properties of mesoscale WAVE complex patterning and highlight an integral relationship between NPF self-organization and cell morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The availability of large collections of bacterial genomes has made genome-wide association studies (GWAS) a common approach for this purpose. The need to employ multiple software tools for data pre- and post-processing limits the application of these methods by experienced bioinformaticians. To address this issue, we have developed a pipeline to perform bacterial GWAS from a set of assemblies and annotations, with multiple phenotypes as targets. The associations are run using five sets of genetic variants: unitigs, gene presence/absence, rare variants (i.e. gene burden test), gene cluster specific k-mers, and all unitigs jointly. All variants passing the association threshold are further annotated to identify overrepresented biological processes and pathways. The results can be further augmented by generating a phylogenetic tree and by predicting the presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence associated genes. We tested the microGWAS pipeline on a previously reported dataset on E. coli virulence, successfully identifying the causal variants, and providing further interpretation on the association results. The microGWAS pipeline integrates the state-of-the-art tools to perform bacterial GWAS into a single, user-friendly, and reproducible pipeline, allowing for the democratization of these analyses.

The extent to which this depends on how different INs process excitatory signals along their dendrites is poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the functional specialization of two major populations of cortical INs is determined by the unique association of different dendritic integration modes with distinct synaptic organization motifs. We found that somatostatin (SST)-INs exhibit NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration and uniform synapse density along the dendritic tree. In contrast, dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)-INs exhibit passive synaptic integration coupled with proximally enriched synaptic distributions. Theoretical analysis shows that these two dendritic configurations result in different strategies to optimize synaptic efficacy in thin dendritic structures. Yet, the two configurations lead to distinct temporal engagement of each IN during network activity. We confirmed these predictions with in vivo recordings of IN activity in the visual cortex of awake mice, revealing a rapid and linear recruitment of PV-INs as opposed to a long-lasting integrative activation of SST-INs. Our work reveals the existence of distinct dendritic strategies that confer distinct temporal representations for the two major classes of neocortical INs and thus dynamics of inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Here, we show that interleukin-6-like cytokine signaling from the Drosophila gut to brain glial cells regulates sleep. Under healthy conditions, this pathway promotes wakefulness. However, elevated gut cytokine signaling in response to oxidative stress - triggered by immune and inflammatory responses in the intestine - induces sleep. The cytokines Unpaired 2 and -3 are upregulated by oxidative stress in enteroendocrine cells and activate JAK-STAT signaling in glial cells, including those of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This activity maintains elevated sleep during oxidative-stress-induced intestinal disturbances, suggesting that the JAK-STAT pathway in glia inhibits wake-promoting signaling to facilitate sleep-dependent restoration under these conditions. We find that the enteric peptide Allatostatin A (AstA) enhances wakefulness, and during intestinal oxidative stress, gut-derived Unpaired 2/3 inhibits AstA receptor expression in BBB glia, thereby sustaining an elevated sleep state during gut inflammation or illness. Taken together, our work identifies a gut-to-glial communication pathway that couples sleep with intestinal homeostasis and disease, enhancing sleep during intestinal sickness, and contributes to our understanding of how sleep disturbances arise from gastrointestinal disturbances.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Recombination is initiated with a double-strand break which is resolved via a crossover, which involves the reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, or a non-crossover, which results in small tracts of non-reciprocal exchange of genetic material. Crossover and non-crossover rates vary between species, populations, individuals, and across the genome. In recent years, recombination rate has been associated with the distribution of ancestry derived from past interspecific hybridization (introgression) in a variety of species. We explore this interaction of recombination and introgression by sequencing spores and detecting crossovers and non-crossovers from two crosses of the yeast Saccharomyces uvarum. One cross is between strains which each contain introgression from their sister species, S. eubayanus, while the other cross has no introgression present. We find that the recombination landscape is significantly different between S. uvarum crosses, and that most of these differences can be explained by the presence of introgression in one cross. Crossovers are reduced and non-crossovers are increased in heterozygous introgression compared to syntenic regions in the cross without introgression. This translates to reduced allele shuffling within introgressed regions, and an overall reduction of shuffling on most chromosomes with introgression compared to the syntenic regions and chromosomes without introgression. Our results suggest that hybridization can significantly influence the recombination landscape, and that the reduction in allele shuffling contributes to the initial purging of introgression in the generations following a hybridization event.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Collectively these areas have been implicated in many higher-level affective and cognitive processes, most notably the adaptive control of decision-making. Despite this appreciation, little is known about how subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex dynamically interact with each other during decision-making. Here we assessed functional interactions between areas by analyzing the activity of thousands of single neurons recorded from eight anatomically defined subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex in macaques performing a visually guided two-choice probabilistic task for different fruit juices. We found that the onset of stimuli and reward delivery globally increased communication between all parts of ventral frontal cortex. Inter-areal communication was, however, temporally specific, occurred through unique activity subspaces between areas, and depended on the encoding of decision variables. In particular, areas 12l and 12o showed the highest connectivity with other areas while being more likely to receive information from other parts of ventral frontal cortex than to send it. This pattern of functional connectivity suggests a role for these two areas in integrating diverse sources of information during decision processes.

We find subsets of reprogramming resistant cells that fail to form functional cell types, undergo cell death, or disrupt normal body patterning.

However, biologically contaminated pipette tips must undergo several washing and sterilization steps before being reused or recycled. Grenova Solutions provides such a decontamination station called TipNovus, which has been implemented by academic and government research labs to reuse pipette tips in sensitive biological assays. Despite this success, the high initial purchasing cost of these washing stations deter many laboratories from incorporating it into their workflow. Additionally, researchers are reluctant to reuse pipette tips due to concerns that the washing process may not thoroughly remove all contaminants. To mitigate these concerns, considering the University of Texas at Austin as an example, we performed a cost-benefit analysis of employing a university-wide washing station. We estimated that only single-time reuse of the pipette tips could result in a 100% return on investment from the equipment purchase cost within 3 months. Then, with our pilot experiments, we confirmed the TipNovus washing steps to be 100% efficient in sterilizing pipette tips contaminated with T7 bacteriophage, enabling their reuse in bacteriophage functionality assays. Finally, we proposed an alternative and more convenient autoclave-based sterilization method to decontaminate pipette tips.

Therefore, when standard antibiotic therapies have failed, some elect electrofulguration (EF) of areas of chronic cystitis when detected on office cystoscopy. EF is thought to remove tissue-resident bacteria that have been previously detected in the bladder walls of postmenopausal women with rUTI. We hypothesized that increased bladder bacterial burden may be associated with incomplete rUTI resolution following EF.

MethodsFollowing IRB approval, bladder biopsies were obtained from 34 consenting menopausal women electing EF for the advanced management of rUTI. 16S rRNA FISH was performed using both universal and Escherichia probes and tissue-resident bacterial load was quantified. Time to UTI relapse after EF was recorded during a six-month follow-up period and the association of bladder bacterial burden and clinical covariates with UTI relapse was assessed.

ResultsWe observed bladder-resident Escherichia in 52% of all participants and in 92% of participants with recent E. coli UTI. Time-to-relapse analysis revealed that women with high bladder bacterial burden as detected by the universal probe had a significantly (p=0.035) higher risk of UTI within six months of EF (HR=3.15, 95% CI: 1.09-9.11). Interestingly, bladder-resident Escherichia was not significantly associated (p=0.26) with a higher risk of UTI relapse (HR= 2.14, 95% CI: 0.58-7.90).

However, central metabolism corresponds to only a small fraction of the biosynthetic potential of microbes: metabolites such as antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and co-factors are underexplored forces shaping microbial communities. Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling. Our results highlight the importance of vitamin auxotrophies and lysis-mediated cross-feeding as important factors controlling microbial community assembly and succession on marine particles.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

However, there is currently no accurate way to risk-stratify patients with LGD, leading to both over- and under-treatment of cancer risk. Here we show that the burden of somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) within resected LGD lesions strongly predicts future cancer development. We performed a retrospective multi-centre validated case-control study of n=122 patients (40 progressors, 82 non-progressors, 270 LGD regions). Low coverage whole genome sequencing revealed CNA burden was significantly higher in progressors than non-progressors (p=2x10-6 in discovery cohort) and was a very significant predictor of CRC risk in univariate analysis (odds ratio = 36; p=9x10-7), outperforming existing clinical risk factors such as lesion size, shape and focality. Optimal risk prediction was achieved with a multivariate model combining CNA burden with the known clinical risk factor of incomplete LGD resection. The measurement of CNAs in LGD lesions is a robust, low-cost and rapidly translatable predictor of CRC risk in IBD that can be used to direct management and so prevent CRC in high-risk individuals whilst sparing those at low-risk from unnecessary intervention.","NA","medrxiv",1720649178791

Conversely, marine photosynthetic diversity is dominated by plastids gained by subsequent endosymbioses of photosynthetic eukaryotes, so-called  complex plastids. The plastids of major eukaryotic lineages including cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, were originally all posited to derive from a single secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga--the  chromalveloate hypothesis 1. Subsequent phylogenetic resolution of eukaryotes indicated that separate events of plastid acquisition must have occurred to account for this distribution of plastids 2,3. The number of such events, however, and the donor organisms for the new plastid endosymbioses are still not resolved. A perceived bottleneck of endosymbiotic plastid gain is the development of protein targeting from the hosts into new plastids, and this supposition has often driven hypotheses towards minimising the number of plastid-gain events to explain plastid distribution in eukaryotes. But how plastid protein-targeting is established for new endosymbionts is often unclear, which makes it difficult to assess the likelihood of plastid transfers between lineages. Here we show that Kareniaceae dinoflagellates, that possess complex plastids known to be derived from haptophytes, acquired all the necessary protein import machinery from these haptophytes. Furthermore, cryo-electron tomography revealed that no additional membranes were added to the Kareniaceae complex plastid during serial endosymbiosis, suggesting that the haptophyte-derived import processes were sufficient. Our analyses suggests that complex red plastids are preadapted for horizontal transmission, potentially explaining their widespread distribution in aquatic algal diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

In this study, we identified a functionally critical residue, Tyr404, at the C-terminus of the S4 helix, whose mutations to tryptophan and alanine yield gain- and loss-of-function channels, respectively. These allosteric mutations mimic the ligand activation or inhibition of the TRPML1 channel without interfering with ligand binding and both mutant channels are susceptible to agonist or antagonist modulation, making them better targets for screening potent TRPML1 activators and inhibitors. We also determined the high-resolution structure of TRPML1 in complex with the PI(4,5)P2 inhibitor, revealing the structural basis underlying this lipid inhibition. In addition, an endogenous phospholipid likely from sphingomyelin is identified in the PI(4,5)P2-bound TRPML1 structure at the same hotspot for agonists and antagonists, providing a plausible structural explanation for the inhibitory effect of sphingomyelin on agonist activation.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

While the aetiology of Parkinson's disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question. The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired before and after L-Dopa administration. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1720649178791

Rewiring catabolism is essential for harnessing industrial biotechnology but remains a substantial metabolic engineering challenge due to its high genetic stability and tight regulation acquired through evolution. In this study, by combining metabolic modeling, rational engineering, and adaptive laboratory evolution, we fundamentally redesigned bacterial catabolism. We created a new-to-nature shikimate pathway-dependent catabolism (SDC) in Pseudomonas putida by reprogramming the shikimate pathway as the primary catabolic route. SDC supports growth by supplying the glycerol catabolic end-product pyruvate, enabling superior production of shikimate pathway-derived molecules. Through SDC, aromatics production reached over 89% of the pathway's maximum theoretical yield, setting a new benchmark for their microbial synthesis. Our study successfully repurposed an anabolic pathway for catabolism, exemplifying the high metabolic plasticity of microbes and providing a bacterial chassis for the efficient production of high-added value compounds.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

This allows us to learn an SFs positional activity and predict the factors regulatory impact on individual exons, yielding regulatory models consistent with prior literature and highly reproducible across knockdowns of the same SF in different cell types, even generalizing well to related species. We leverage this generalizability to distinguish direct targets from the indirect effects of knockdown, and identify the secondary SFs responsible for these widespread indirect effects. We further uncover evidence of cooperative regulation between RBFOX and QKI. The generality of our statistical framework means it could be extended to the study of RNA regulation and processing beyond splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient adapts Gumbel-softmax gradient estimators, to quickly map out a Pareto front of migration histories that cover the range of histories that are parsimonious under some criteria. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Compared with the current state-of-the-art, Metient recovers more migration histories, is more accurate, and is more than 40x faster. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metient's reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in 24 patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and thus finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

A recent federal ban prevents SSPs from using federal funding to procure safer smoking supplies. There is a lack of research on safer smoking supply distribution and harm reduction outcomes. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between distribution of safer smoking supplies by SSPs and levels of participant engagement and naloxone distribution.

MethodsWe used data from the 2023 National Survey of Syringe Services Programs (NSSSP) (N=429), which measured services delivered in 2022. SSPs reported whether they distributed safer smoking pipes (yes/no). We examined the relationship between safer smoking pipe distribution and two outcomes: the number of participant encounters and naloxone doses distributed.

ResultsThere were 187 SSPs (43.6%) that distributed pipes for smoking to participants. Compared to SSPs that did not distribute pipes, those that distributed pipes reported more participant encounters (aRR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.09-2.02) and naloxone dose distribution (aRR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.89-1.65), though this latter finding was not statistically significant.

ConclusionsFindings showed SSPs distributing safer smoking pipes had more participant engagement and naloxone distribution.

Functional profiling of ACE2 orthologs from 105 mammalian species led to the identification of host tropism determinants, including an ACE2 N432-glycosylation restricting viral recognition, and the design of a soluble P.nat ACE2 mutant with potent viral neutralizing activity. Our findings reveal convergent acquisition of ACE2 usage for merbecoviruses found in European bats, underscoring the extraordinary diversity of ACE2 recognition modes among coronaviruses and the promiscuity of this receptor.

Caenorhabditis elegans is widely used to study developmental biology, mitochondrial disease, and mitochondrial toxicity. Oxidative phosphorylation generally increases during development in many species, and genetic and environmental factors may alter this normal trajectory. Altered mitochondrial function during development can lead to both drastic, short-term responses including arrested development and death, and subtle consequences that may persist throughout life and into subsequent generations. Understanding normal and altered developmental mitochondrial biology in C. elegans is currently constrained by incomplete and conflicting reports on how mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters change during development in this species. We used a Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux (XF) Analyzer to carry out a comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates (OCR) throughout larval development in C. elegans. We optimized and describe conditions for analysis of basal OCR, basal mitochondrial OCR, ATP-linked OCR, spare and maximal respiratory capacity, proton leak, and non-mitochondrial OCR. A key consideration is normalization, and we present and discuss results as normalized per individual worm, protein content, worm volume, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) count, nuclear DNA (ncDNA) count, and mtDNA:ncDNA ratio. Which normalization process is best depends on the question being asked, and differences in normalization explain some of the discrepancies in previously reported developmental changes in OCR in C. elegans. Broadly, when normalized to worm number, our results agree with previous reports in showing dramatic increases in OCR throughout development. However, when normalized to total protein, worm volume, or ncDNA or mtDNA count, after a significant 2-3-fold increase from L1 to L2 stages, we found small or no changes in most OCR parameters from the L2 to the L4 stage, other than a marginal increase at L3 in spare and maximal respiratory capacity. Overall, our results indicate an earlier cellular shift to oxidative metabolism than suggested in most previous literature.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The MEF system can also be combined with rescue studies to characterize the function of mutant genes/proteins, such as disease-causing variants. However, primary MEFs undergo senescence soon after isolation and passaging, making long-term genetic manipulations difficult. Previously described methods for MEF immortalization are often inefficient or alter the physiological properties of the cells. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for immortalizing MEFs via CRISPR-mediated deletion of the Tp53 gene. This method is highly efficient and consistently generates immortalized MEFs, or iMEFs, within 14 days.

Here, we elucidate the in vivo temporal RNA interactome landscapes of Imp and Syp during larval brain development. Imp and Syp bind a highly overlapping set of conserved mRNAs encoding proteins involved in neurodevelopment. We identify transcripts differentially occupied by Imp/Syp over time, featuring a network of known and novel candidate temporal regulators that are post-transcriptionally regulated by Imp/Syp. Furthermore, the physical and co-evolutionary relationships between Imp and Syp binding sites reveal a combinatorial, rather than competitive, mode of molecular interplay.

Using somatic embryogenesis in maritime pine, we found that temperature during the maturation phase affects embryo development and post-embryonic tree growth for up to three years. We examined whether this somatic stress memory could stem from temperature- and/or development-induced changes in DNA methylation. To do this, we developed a 200 Mb custom sequence capture bisulfite analysis of genes and promoters to identify differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) between temperature treatments (18, 23, and 28{degrees}C) and developmental stages (immature and cotyledonary embryos, shoot apical meristem of 2-year-old plants) and investigate if these differences can be mitotically transmitted from embryonic to post-embryonic development (epigenetic memory). We revealed a high prevalence of temperature-induced DMCs in genes (8-14%) compared to promoters (less than 1%) in all 3 cytosine contexts. Developmental DMCs showed a comparable pattern but only in the CG context, and with a high trend towards hypo-methylation, particularly in the promoters. A high percentage of DMCs induced by developmental transitions were found memorized in genes (up to 45-50%) and promoters (up to 90%). In contrast, temperature-induced memory was lower and confined to genes after both embryonic (up to 14%) and post-embryonic development (up to 8%). Using stringent criteria, we identified ten genes involved in defense responses and adaptation, embryo development and chromatin regulation that are candidates for the establishment of a persistent epigenetic memory of temperature sensed during embryo maturation in maritime pine.

These processes leave unique signatures in patterns of trait evolution, impacting the tempo and mode of morphological macroevolution. While there is a broad understanding of the history of some organismal traits (e.g. body size), there is little consensus about the evolutionary mode of most others. This includes the relative contribution of prolonged (Darwinian gradualist) and episodic (Simpsonian jump) changes towards the evolution of novel morphologies. Here we use new exon-capture and linear morphological datasets to investigate the tempo and mode of morphological evolution in Australo-Melanesian Tiliquini skinks. We generate a well-supported time-calibrated phylogenomic tree from [~]400 nuclear markers for more than 100 specimens including undescribed diversity, and provide unprecedented resolution of the rapid Miocene diversification of these lizards. By collecting a morphological dataset that encompasses the lizard body plan (19 traits across the head, body, limb, and tail) we are able to identify that most traits evolve conservatively but infrequent evolutionary bursts result in morphological novelty. These phenotypic discontinuities occur via rapid rate increases along individual branches, inconsistent with both gradualistic and punctuated equilibrial evolutionary modes. Instead, this  punctuated gradualism has resulted in the rapid evolution of blue-tongued giants and armored dwarves in the [~]20 million years since colonizing Australia. These results outline the evolutionary pathway towards new morphologies and highlight the heterogeneity of evolutionary tempo and mode, even within individual traits.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The development of quick, easy, and low cost methods to quantify field level variation is essential to successful implementation of precision agriculture at scale. Temporal plant height and growth rates collected with unoccupied aerial vehicles mounted with red, green, blue sensors have the potential to predict end of season grain yield, which could facilitate mid-season management decisions. Image-based plant height data was collected weekly from commercial maize fields in three growing seasons to assess variation within fields and the relationship with grain yield variation. Plant height, growth rate, and grain yield had variable relationships depending on the time point and growth environment. Models developed using temporal traits predicted grain yield variation within a commercial field up to r = 0.7, though insufficient water affected the prediction accuracy in one field due to the limited representation of drought environments in the model development. In the future, with more data from stress environments, such as drought, this method has potential for high accuracy grain yield prediction across a range of environmental conditions. This study demonstrates the potential of using unoccupied aerial vehicles to derive vegetative growth patterns and model within field variations, and has application in making mid-season management decisions.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

This study investigated the genetic basis of a canonically parallel trait: pelvic spine reduction in sticklebacks. Pelvic reduction has a highly parallel genetic basis in threespine stickleback in populations around the world, always involving a deletion of the pel1 enhancer of Pitx1. In three populations of brook stickleback in Alberta, Canada, pelvic reduction did not involve Pitx1. Instead, pelvic reduction in one population involved a mutation in an exon of Tbx4, and it involved a mutation in an intron of Lmbr1 in the other two populations. Hence, the parallel phenotypic evolution of pelvic spine reduction across stickleback genera, and among brook stickleback populations, has a non-parallel genetic basis. This suggests that there is redundancy in the genetic basis of this adaptive polymorphism, but it is not clear whether this indicates a lack of constraint on the evolution of this adaptive trait. Whether the different pleiotropic effects of different mutations have different fitness consequences, or whether certain pelvic reduction mutations confer specific benefits in certain environments, remains to be determined.

Lay SummaryIn this study, I looked for the genetic basis of a well-studied trait in stickleback fish: the pelvic spines. This structure (i.e. the pelvic girdle and attached spines) has a shared developmental basis (and is homologous to) the pelvic bones and hind limbs of all tetrapods (including humans). We know, from studying mice, fish, humans, and even manatees, that there are several genes that could affect the development of pelvic spines and hind limbs. In one species of stickleback, the threespine stickleback, however, a single gene called Pitx1 is always involved in the loss of pelvic spines in populations that have adapted to freshwater lakes. This replicated evolution of the same trait in the same environmental conditions is called parallel evolution. Its remarkable that Pitx1 is always the gene underlying this adaptive loss of spines in freshwater threespine stickleback populations. I was interested in whether this ""genetic parallelism"" extended to other species of stickleback that have also evolved the loss of pelvic spines. I looked at three populations of brook stickleback (which are never found in the ocean), each of which contains individuals with and without pelvic spines. I found that the Pitx1 genetic parallelism does not extend to brook stickleback, and, in fact, the genetic basis of pelvic spine loss differs between populations. In Muir Lake and Astotoin Lake, pelvic spine loss results from a mutation in the Lmbr1 gene, and in Shunda Lake, pelvic spine loss results from a mutation in the Tbx4 gene.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

However, the mechanisms that make certain tissues more susceptible to defects in these universal pathways remain mysterious. In this study, we provide the first investigation of RFC1 gene function in vivo using zebrafish. We showed that RFC1 is expressed in neural progenitor cells within the developing cerebellum and that it is necessary to maintain these cells genomic integrity during neurogenic maturation. Accordingly, RFC1 loss-of-function leads to a severe cerebellar phenotype due to impaired neurogenesis of both Purkinje and granule cells. Our data thus point to a specific role of RFC1 in the developing cerebellum, paving the way for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying RFC1-related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

It is unclear which molecular mechanisms are at the basis of this defect in humans as the few mechanistic studies performed so far were done in animals. Here, we leveraged human embryonic stem cell- derived forebrain organoids as a model for human corticogenesis. Organoids were X-irradiated with a moderate and a high dose at different time points, representing very early and mid corticogenesis. Irradiation caused a dose- and developmental-timing-dependent reduction in organoid size, which was more prominent in developmentally younger organoids. This coincided with a dose-dependent canonical p53-DREAM-dependent DNA damage response (DDR), consisting of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis. The DDR was delayed and less pronounced in the older organoids. Besides the DDR, we observed radiation-induced premature differentiation of neural progenitors and changes in metabolism. Importantly, our transcriptomic analysis furthermore demonstrated a concerted p53-E2F4-dependent repression of primary microcephaly genes. We found that this was a human-specific feature, as it was not observed in mouse embryonic brains or primary mouse neural progenitor cells. Thus, human forebrain organoids are an excellent model to investigate prenatal DNA damage-induced microcephaly and to uncover potentially targetable human-specific pathways.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Upregulation of auxin signaling by genetic mutations or exogenous auxin treatment can induce seedless fruit formation from unpollinated ovaries, termed parthenocarpy. Recent studies suggested that the class A AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ARF6) and ARF8 in Arabidopsis play dual functions by first inhibiting fruit initiation when complexed with unidentified corepressor IAA protein(s) before pollination, and later promoting fruit growth after fertilization as ARF dimers. However, whether and how posttranslational modification(s) regulate ARF6- and ARF8-mediated fruit growth were unknown. In this study, we reveal that both ARF6 and ARF8 are O-fucosylated in their middle region (MR) by SPINDLY (SPY), a novel nucleocytoplasmic protein O-fucosyltransferase, which catalyzes the addition of a fucose moiety to specific Ser/Thr residues of target proteins. Epistasis, biochemical and transcriptome analyses indicated that ARF6 and ARF8 are downstream of SPY, but ARF8 plays a more predominant role in parthenocarpic fruit growth. Intriguingly, two ARF6/8-interacting proteins, the co-repressor IAA9 and MED8, a subunit of the coactivator Mediator complex, were also O-fucosylated by SPY. Biochemical assays demonstrated that SPY-mediated O-fucosylation of these proteins reduced ARF-MED8 interaction, which led to enhanced transcription repression activity of the ARF6/8-IAA9 complex but impaired transactivation activities of ARF6/8. Our study unveils the role of protein O-fucosylation by SPY in attenuating auxin-triggered fruit growth through modulation of activities of key transcription factors, a co-repressor and the coactivator MED complex.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The loss of liver mass affects tissue-specific mitogenic inhibitors in the blood, which in turn regulate the proliferation of remaining hepatocytes and liver regeneration. Although well described in a number of publications, which inhibitory substances or ""sensor molecules"" control the regeneration mechanisms to properly maintain liver size remain unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized, membrane-limited structures secreted by cells into the extracellular space. Their proposed role is stable intercellular carriers of proteins and RNAs, mostly micro-RNA, from secreted to recipient cells. Taken up by the recipient cells, EVs can significantly modulate their biological functions. In the present study, using in vivo and in vitro models, we demonstrate that hepatocyte proliferation and liver regeneration are regulated by EVs secreted by hepatocytes into the bloodstream. This regulation is carried out through a negative feedback mechanism, which explains the very precise regeneration of liver tissue after massive damage. We also demonstrate that an essential component of this mechanism is RNA carried by hepatocyte-derived EVs. These findings open up a new and unexplored area of biology regarding the mechanisms involved in the homeostasis regulation of various constantly renewing tissues by maintaining the optimal size and correct ratio between differentiating and proliferating cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The Irregular facet mutation, which alters Kr expression, and neuroblast-specific Kr depletion allow MBNBs, but not other neuroblasts, to persist beyond development and generate neurons in adult brains. Persisting MBNBs express Imp, an RNA-binding protein that promotes neuroblast proliferation and survival. Our results underscore a critical role for Kr in the developmental control of a specific progenitor population, uncovering a novel mechanism controlling adult neurogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The correct distribution of auxin carrier proteins relies on the intracellular trafficking of these proteins aided by filamentous actin as a track. However, the precise role of actin in lateral root development is still elusive. Here, using vegetative class actin isovariant mutants, we revealed that loss of actin isovariant ACT8 led to an increase in lateral root formation. The distribution of auxin within pericycle cells was altered in act8 mutant, primarily due to the altered distribution of AUX1 and PIN7. Interestingly, incorporation of act2 mutant in act8 background (act2act8) effectively nullified the LR phenotype observed in act8 mutant, indicating that ACT2 plays an important role in LR development. To explore further, we investigated the possibility that the act8 mutants LR phenotype and cellular auxin distribution resulted from ACT2 overexpression. Consistent with the idea, enhanced lateral root formation, altered AUX1, PIN7 expression and auxin distribution in pericycle cells were observed in ACT2 overexpression lines. Collectively, these results suggest that actin isovariant ACT2 but not ACT8 plays a pivotal role in regulating source to sink auxin distribution during lateral root organogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

ObjectiveThis study reveals the role of Decorin (DCN) contributes to the mature and vascularized COs and assesses the biological mechanism responsible for CO maturation.

Methods and ResultsDCN-treated COs exhibit structural maturation involving aligned sarcomere, mitochondria, and t-tubule structures, and vessel formations, as well as functional maturation involving synchronized contraction-relaxation, Ca2+ transient, and increases ion channel expressions. DCN-treated COs also show metabolic maturation, including enhanced fatty acid oxidation and increased mitophagy. Transcriptional profiling results indicate that DCN-treated COs have increased levels of AMPK signaling and mitophagy. In DCN-treated COs, AMPK knockdown affects mitochondrial biogenesis, cardiac metabolism, ion channels, and mitophagy.

ConclusionsThese findings indicate that DCN is crucial for development of mature, vascularized COs and that CO maturation is primarily regulated through AMPK signaling, which is triggered by DCN.

The single-cell transplantation assay and our own paired daughter cell assay of phenotypic HSCs has revealed the presence of HSCs with reconstitution capacity whose differentiation potential is restricted to the myeloid lineage (MySCs) and the presence of novel direct differentiation pathway form HSCs to MySCs (named myeloid bypass pathway). However, how HSCs differentiate in vivo during hematopoiesis has remained unclear since the paired daughter cell assay was performed partially ex vivo. Aiming to characterize HSCs, including the myeloid bypass pathway, we examined the kinetics of HSC differentiation using a mathematical model. We analyzed data from single-cell transplantation assays in which five blood cell lineages were followed successively after transplantation. An age-related skewing to the myeloid lineage was quantitatively indicated as the production of B cells reduced with age. Dependence on platelet bypass increased with aging and consistently high dependence was associated with long-term reconstitution capacity of the HSCs. Focusing on the ratio of chimerism among cell lineages, the characteristics of dependence on platelet bypass can be accurately determined by the ratio of erythrocyte to platelet chimerism at 8 weeks after transplantation. This new identification criterion is an indicator of long-term reconstitution of HSCs that does not rely on observation of long-term transplantation experiments. These findings reveal the novel characteristics of HSCs related to aging and stemness and highlight the importance of the bypass pathway in HSC differentiation.

Significance statementIn vivo differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is important for understanding blood cell production. Here we investigated the differentiation kinetics of HSCs in single-cell transplantation assays by using a mathematical model. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the bypass pathway in platelet production for the long-term reconstitution capacity of HSCs. These results also suggest the utility of studying time changes in HSC differentiation. The new HSC characteristics and its detection criteria identified in this study are expected to be useful in understanding HSC diversity and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

With over 50% of arable land projected to become saline by 2050, understanding tomato responses to saline environments is essential. Soil salinization, prevalent in arid regions, leads to salt stress. Roots are primary salinity sensors and integrate stress responses like nutrient deficiency. Understanding the molecular processes maintaining root growth is vital for crop resilience. While salt stress impacts on tomato seed germination, shoot growth, and fruit yield are documented, root development remains underexplored. Most studies have focused on a limited number of cultivars and their physiological responses, not the genetic basis of salt resilience. Wild tomato relatives, such as Solanum pimpinellifolium, offer traits that are beneficial for breeding resilient crops. However, few studies have examined the genetics of salinity tolerance in S. pimpinellifolium. This study characterizes salt stress-induced changes in root system architecture (RSA) using a natural diversity panel of 220 wild tomato accessions. We identified natural variation in lateral root development and several candidate loci through Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) revealed 22 candidate genes overlapping with GWAS findings. Exploring root transcriptome reprogramming in two accessions with differing lateral root responses highlighted genotype-specific changes. Integrating GWAS, BSA, and RNA sequencing data identified four key genes underlying differential lateral root development under salt stress. These findings offer novel genetic targets for improving salt resilience in tomatoes, providing opportunities for future research and breeding programs to enhance crop sustainability and productivity.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

The huge number of scientific articles using the term arousal ([~]50.000) highlights the importance of the concept, but also explains why such a vast literature had never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. Meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature further reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a domain-general cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we found that dysgranular insular area 7, the region with highest convergence across varieties of arousal, also shows activation specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

When applied to unicellular eukaryotes such as Plasmodium parasites, scRNA-seq provides a single-cell resolution particularly valuable to study complex infections which are often comprised of mixed life stages and clones. Until now, the application of scRNA-seq has been mainly limited to in vitro and animal malaria models, despite known transcriptional differences as compared to circulating parasite populations. This is primarily due to the challenges of working with Plasmodium natural infections in endemic settings. We validated sample preparation methods and a novel single-cell RNA sequencing technology for the first time in P. knowlesi parasites which can be effectively implemented to analyze natural infections in low-resource settings. We recovered 22,345 P. knowlesi single-cell transcriptomes containing all asexual blood stages from 6 in vitro culture samples, with conditions mimicking natural infections, and generated the most extensive P. knowlesi single-cell dataset to date. All 6 samples produced reproducible circular UMAP projections with consistent cluster localization and high gene expression correlation, regardless of the sample preparation methods used. Biomarker expression and life stage annotation using the Malaria Cell Atlas P. knowlesi reference dataset further confirmed these results. In conclusion, the combination of adaptable sample preparation methods with novel preservation and scRNA-seq technology has the potential to fundamentally transform the study of natural infections. This approach unlocks the use of scRNA-seq in field studies which will lead to new insights into Plasmodium parasite biology.

ImportanceSequencing unicellular organisms, such as malaria parasites, at the single-cell level is important to understand the diversity present in cell populations. Until now, single-cell sequencing of malaria has been primarily limited to laboratory models. While these models are key to understanding biological processes, there are known differences between lab models and parasite populations circulating in natural human infections. This study presents sample preparation methods and a new single-cell RNA sequencing technology that enables sample collection from natural infections in low-resource settings. Using a mock natural infection, we validated this new single-cell RNA sequencing technology using marker genes with known expression patterns and a reference dataset from the Malaria Cell Atlas. We demonstrate that high-quality single-cell transcriptomes with consistent expression patterns can be recovered using various sample preparation methods, thereby unlocking single-cell sequencing for field studies and leading to additional insights into parasite biology in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

However, a significant and yet unexplained branch length variation of Y chromosome lineages has been observed, notably amongst those that are highly diverged from the human reference Y chromosome. Understanding the origin of this variation, which has previously been attributed to changes in generation time, mutation rate, or efficacy of selection, is important for accurately reconstructing human evolutionary and demographic history.

Here, we analyze Y chromosomes from present-day and ancient modern humans, as well as Neandertals, and show that branch length variation amongst human Y chromosomes cannot solely be explained by differences in demographic or biological processes. Instead, reference bias results in mutations being missed on Y chromosomes that are highly diverged from the reference used for alignment. We show that masking fast-evolving, highly divergent regions of the human Y chromosome mitigates the effect of this bias and enables more accurate determination of branch lengths in the Y chromosome phylogeny. Finally, we show that this approach allows us to estimate the age of ancient samples from Y chromosome sequence data and provide updated TMRCA estimates using the portion of the Y chromosome where the effect of reference bias is minimised.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

However, how the diversity of centromeres evolved, ranging from localized centromeres in monocentric species to complex chromosome-wide distributed centromere regions in holocentric species, remains elusive. Our cellular and genomic analyses in Timema stick insects reveal that within cell variation of the major centromere protein CenH3 recapitulates the variation typically observed across species. While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or small groups of chromosomes, they exhibit a holocentric-like distribution on the sex chromosome and bind to more complex intergenic regions. Despite this contrasting distribution, all chromosomes, including the sex chromosome, attach to spindle microtubules at a single location, marking the first instance of a functionally monocentric species with holocentric-like attributes. Together, our findings highlight the potential for gradual transitions towards holocentricity or CenH3-independent centromere determination, and help to understand the rapid centromere sequence divergence between species.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

This study aimed to determine the potential quantities of infectious HPAIV in raw milk in affected states where herds were confirmed positive by USDA for HPAIV (and therefore were not representative of the entire population), and to confirm that the commonly used continuous flow pasteurization using the FDA approved 72{degrees}C (161{degrees}F) for 15 s conditions for high temperature short time (HTST) processing, will inactivate the virus. Double-blinded raw milk samples from bulk storage tanks from farms (n=275) were collected in four affected states. Samples were screened for influenza A using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qrRT-PCR) of which 158 (57.5%) were positive and were subsequently quantified in embryonating chicken eggs. Thirty-nine qrRT-PCR positive samples (24.8%) were positive for infectious virus with a mean titer of 3.5 log10 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) per mL. To closely simulate commercial milk pasteurization processing systems, a pilot-scale continuous flow pasteurizer was used to evaluate HPAIV inactivation in artificially contaminated raw milk using the most common legal conditions in the US: 72{degrees}C (161{degrees}F) for 15s. Among all replicates at two flow rates (n=5 at 0.5L/min; n=4 at 1L/min), no viable virus was detected. A mean reduction of [&ge;]5.8 {+/-} 0.2 log10 EID50/mL occurred during the heating phase where the milk is brought to 72.5{degrees}C before the holding tube. Estimates from heat-transfer analysis support that standard U.S. continuous flow HTST pasteurization parameters will inactivate >12 log10 EID50/mL of HPAIV, which is ~9 log10 EID50/mL greater than the mean quantity of infectious virus detected in raw milk from bulk storage tank samples. These findings demonstrate that the milk supply is safe.","NA","medrxiv",1720649178791

We reasoned that the typical use of a confocal detection pinhole in MINFLUX nanoscopy, suppressing background and providing optical sectioning, should facilitate the detection and resolution of single fluorophores even amid scattering and optically challenging tissue environments.

How this coordination is established is unknown. Here we use quantitative live cell imaging combined with computational inference to determine how changes in global protein synthesis rates alter protein decay rates. We identified two modes of adaptation hinging on differential responses of the cell cycle to changes in protein synthesis rates. A passive adaptation of protein degradation and dilution rates operates in cells tightly coupling proliferation rate to protein synthesis rates, allowing to partially buffer changes in proteome concentrations with increased loss of short-lived proteins. In contrast, the proliferation rate of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is hyposensitive to moderate changes in protein synthesis. mESCs uncouple protein degradation and dilution rates and robustly maintain their protein levels. Our work illuminates the complex interplay between protein synthesis, degradation, and cell division to regulate proteome homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

Here we characterise the growth of isolated Nitrobacter strain NHB1 as a function of pH and nitrite (NO2-) concentration, and its influence on the activity of acidophilic soil ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) in co-culture. NHB1 is acidotolerant and grows optimally at pH 6.0 (range 5.0 - 7.5) at initial NO2- concentrations of 500 {micro}M. However, the optimum decreases to pH 5.0 at lower initial NO2- concentrations closer to those found in soil, with detectable growth down to pH 3.5. NHB1 has a comparatively high affinity for NO2- with an apparent-half-saturation constant (54 {micro}M) one order of magnitude lower than its closest relative, the neutrophilic strain Nitrobacter hamburgensis X14. In co-culture, NHB1 enhances the growth of acidophilic AOA. Specifically, Nitrosotalea devaniterrae Nd1 and Nitrosotalea sinensis Nd2 are sensitive to NO2--derived compounds and only oxidise [~]200-300 {micro}M ammonia (NH3) in batch cultures. However, in co-culture with NHB1, pH ranges were lowered by [~]0.5 pH units and both strains could oxidise up to 2.7-2.9 mM NH3, only limited by buffering capacity. NHB1 possesses a cyanase facilitating reciprocal cross-feeding via generating cyanate-derived NH3 and utilising AOA-derived NO2-. Removal of NO2- is likely crucial for nitrifier growth in acidic soils and this study highlights the importance of considering substrate and metabolic product concentrations when characterising physiology. Genome analysis reveals that NHB1 is distinct from validated species and the name  Nitrobacter laanbroekii is proposed.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

However, empirical evidence for such flicker-induced standing waves in the visual cortex was missing. We recorded cortical responses to flicker in awake mice using high spatial resolution widefield imaging in combination with high temporal resolution glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter (iGluSnFR). The temporal frequency tuning curves in the mouse V1 were similar to those observed in humans, showing a banded structure with multiple resonance peaks (8 Hz, 15 Hz, 33 Hz). Spatially, all flicker frequencies evoked responses in V1 corresponding to retinotopic stimulus location, but some evoked additional peaks. These flicker-induced cortical patterns displayed standing wave characteristics and matched linear wave equation solutions in an area restricted to the visual cortex. Taken together, the interaction of traveling waves with cortical area boundaries leads to spatiotemporal activity patterns that may affect perception.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178791

One of the best-understood systems for division site selection is the Min system in Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the Min system displays remarkable pole-to-pole oscillation, creating a time-averaged minimum at the cell`s geometric center, which marks the future division site. Interestingly, the Gram-positive model species Bacillus subtilis also encodes homologous proteins: the cell division inhibitor MinC and the Walker-ATPase MinD. However, B. subtilis lacks the activating protein MinE, which is essential for Min dynamics in E. coli. We have shown before that the B. subtilis Min system is highly dynamic and quickly relocalizes to active sites of division. This raised questions about how Min protein dynamics are regulated on a molecular level in B. subtilis. Here, we show with a combination of in vitro experiments and in vivo single-molecule imaging that the ATPase activity of B. subtilis MinD is activated solely by membrane binding. Additionally, both monomeric and dimeric MinD bind to the membrane, and binding of ATP to MinD is a prerequisite for fast membrane detachment. Single-molecule localization microscopy data confirm membrane binding of monomeric MinD variants. However, only wild type MinD enriches at cell poles and sites of ongoing division, likely due to interaction with MinJ. Monomeric MinD variants and locked dimers remain distributed along the membrane and lack the characteristic pattern formation. Single-molecule tracking data further support that MinD has a freely diffusive population, which is increased in the monomeric variants and a membrane binding defective mutant. Thus, MinD dynamics in B. subtilis do not require any unknown protein component and can be fully explained by MinD`s binding and unbinding kinetics with the membrane. The generation of MinD patterns relies on the short-lived temporal residence of MinD dimers at the membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

While the factors responsible for this ""lipid divide"" remain unclear, this has important implications for understanding the evolutionary history of eukaryotes, which likely originated from within the Archaea and therefore changed membrane composition from isoprenoid-based to fatty acid-based lipids. Here, using 13C labelling studies, we demonstrate that the archaeal model organisms Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Haloferax volcanii are capable of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Biochemical characterization and in vitro pathway reconstitution identify the key enzymes of a newly proposed fatty acid synthesis pathway in S. acidocaldarius and show that ketothiolase, ketoacyl-CoA reductase, and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase form a stable assembly mediated by a DUF35 domain protein, which represents the first characterization of an archaeal fatty acid synthase complex. The final step is catalysed by an NADPH-dependent enoyl-CoA reductase. Deletion of the enoyl-CoA reductase demonstrate that this pathway operates in vivo in S. acidocaldarius. The presented results including phylogenetic analysis reveal that the potential to synthesize fatty acids is widespread across archaeal lineages. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that archaea are capable of synthesizing fatty acids, elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process and provide additional insights into the evolutionary histories of fatty acid synthesis in archaea.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

Texture, however, remains a surprisingly unexplored aspect, despite providing key information about the state of the food through properties such as hardness, liquidity, and granularity. Food perception is achieved by specialised sensory neurons, which themselves are defined by the receptor genes they express. While it was assumed that sensory neurons respond to one or few closely-related stimuli, more recent findings challenge this notion and support evidence that certain sensory neurons are more broadly tuned. In the Drosophila taste system, gustatory neurons respond to cues of opposing hedonic valence or to olfactory cues. Here, we identified that larvae ingest and navigate towards specific food substrate hardnesses, and probed the role of gustatory organs in this behaviour. By developing a genetic tool targeting specifically gustatory organs, we show that these organs are major contributors for evaluation of food texture and ingestion decision-making. We find that ablation of gustatory organs not only results in loss of chemosensation, but also navigation and ingestion preference to varied substrate textures. Furthermore, we show that certain neurons in the primary taste organ exhibit varied and concurrent physiological responses to mechanical and multimodal stimulation. We show that individual neurons house independent mechanisms for multiple sensory modalities, challenging assumptions about capabilities of sensory neurons. We propose that further investigations, across the animal kingdom, may reveal higher sensory complexity than currently anticipated.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans. Furthermore, hippocampal activity scaled with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area (SMA) represented individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans. Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and SMA was modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation. These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria.

We developed molecular, optical, and analytical tools to map sub-millisecond voltage dynamics throughout the dendritic trees of CA1 pyramidal neurons under diverse optogenetic and synaptic stimulus patterns, in acute brain slices. We observed history-dependent spike back-propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes). Dendritic depolarization created a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation. Collisions of dSpikes with synaptic inputs triggered calcium channel and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent plateau potentials, with accompanying complex spikes at the soma. This hierarchical ion channel network acts as a spike-rate accelerometer, providing an intuitive picture of how dendritic excitations shape associative plasticity rules.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.

MethodsSurveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.

ResultsThe Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.

ConclusionsUrgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak.","10.1038/s41591-024-03130-3","medrxiv",1720649178792

Here we introduce Nanotiming, a nanopore sequencing-based method producing high-resolution, telomere-to-telomere replication timing (RT) profiles of eukaryotic genomes by interrogating changes in intracellular dTTP concentration during S phase through competition with its analogue bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUTP) for incorporation into replicating DNA. Nanotiming solely demands the labelling of asynchronously growing cells with an innocuous dose of BrdU during one doubling time followed by BrdU quantification along nanopore reads. We demonstrate in yeast S. cerevisiae that Nanotiming precisely reproduces RT profiles generated by reference methods in wild-type and mutant cells inactivated for known RT determinants, for one-tenth of the cost. Nanotiming is simple, accurate, inexpensive, amenable to large-scale analyses, and is capable of unveiling RT at individual telomeres, revealing that Rif1 iconic telomere regulator directly delays the replication only of telomeres with specific subtelomeric elements.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

Most miniaturized neural interfaces require a wired connection for external power and data acquisition systems. The wires are required to be commutated through a slip ring to accommodate for twisting of the wire or tether and alleviate torsional stresses. The increased trend towards long term continuous neural recordings have spurred efforts to realize active commutators that can sense the torsional stress and actively rotation the slip ring to alleviate torsional stresses. Current solutions however require addition of sensing modules. Here we report on an active translating commutator that uses computer vision (CV) algorithms on behavioral imaging videos captured during the experiment to track the animals position and heading direction in real-time and uses this information to control the translation and rotation of a slipring commutator to accommodate for accumulated mouse heading orientation changes and position. The CV guided active commutator has been extensively tested in three separate behavioral contexts and we show reliable cortex-wide imaging in a mouse in an open-field with a miniaturized widefield cortical imaging device. Active commutation resulted in no changes to measured neurophysiological signals. The active commutator is fully open source, can be assembled using readily available off-the-shelf components, and is compatible with a wide variety of miniaturized neurophotonic and neurophysiology devices.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024.

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates host cell infection and cell-cell fusion that causes stabilization of tumor suppressor p53 protein. In-silico analysis previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 spike interacts with p53 directly but this putative interaction has not been demonstrated in cells. We examined the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike, p53 and MDM2 (E3 ligase, which mediates p53 degradation) in cancer cells using an immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interrupts p53-MDM2 protein interaction but did not detect SARS-CoV-2 spike bound with p53 protein in the cancer cells. We further observed that SARS-CoV-2 spike suppresses p53 transcriptional activity in cancer cells including after nutlin exposure of wild-type p53-, spike S2-expressing tumor cells and inhibits chemotherapy-induced p53 gene activation of p21(WAF1), TRAIL Death Receptor DR5 and MDM2. The suppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike on p53-dependent gene activation provides a potential molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact tumorigenesis, tumor progression and chemotherapy sensitivity. In fact, cisplatin-treated tumor cells expressing spike S2 were found to have increased cell viability as compared to control cells. Further observations on {gamma}-H2AX expression in spike S2-expressing cells treated with cisplatin may indicate altered DNA damage sensing in the DNA damage response pathway. The preliminary observations reported here warrant further studies to unravel the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and its various encoded proteins including spike on pathways of tumorigenesis and response to cancer therapeutics.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (20 June 2024), we have tested 84 retail milk samples from all ten Canadian provinces (NL, NS, PEI, NB, QC, ON, MB, SK, AB, and BC) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner.

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720649178792

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720649178792

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
