However, recent and heavily disputed debates on data quality have raised questions on the accuracy of demographic data at older ages. Here, we catalogue late-life survival patterns of every country in the world from 1970-2021 using comprehensive estimates of old-age populations provided by global governments and curated by the United Nations. Analysis of 236 nations or states across 51 years reveals that late-life survival data is dominated by anomalies at all scales and in all time periods. Life expectancy at age 100 and late-life survival from ages 80 to 100+, which we term centenarian attainment rate, is highest in a seemingly random assortment of states. The top 10  blue zone regions with the best survival to ages 100+ routinely includes Thailand, Kenya and Malawi - respectively now 212th and 202nd in the world for life expectancy, the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara, and Puerto Rico where birth certificates are so unreliable they were recently declared invalid as a legal document. These anomalous rankings are conserved across long time periods and multiple non-overlapping cohorts, and do not seem to be sampling effects. Instead these patterns suggest a persistent inability, even for nation-states or global organisations, to detect or measure error rates in human age data, with troubling implications for epidemiology, demography, and medicine.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

The frequency and pace of these major genome structural changes are unknown, and it remains unclear whether or how they impact long-term genome evolution. Here, we compare whole chromosomal sequences of 3,631 genomes from 2,291 species spanning all major animal clades and show that animal karyotypes evolve primarily via karyotype contraction, associated with increased rates of chromosomal fusion-with-mixing and dispersion that largely obey chromosomal algebra1, or karyotype expansion, which breaks up ancestral linkage groups and forms new chromosomal elements via non-algebraic changes. We show that chromosomal changes can be associated with major extinction events. Using a multi-scale encoding of pan-animal genome homology and a manifold representation of genomic changes, we find that genome evolution is not only driven by changes at the chromosomal level, but that subchromosomal mixing and irreversibility define clade-specific evolution. Using this  evolutionary genome topology approach, we calculate extrema of irreversible genomic configurations and identify species that occupy intermediate manifold positions, providing evidence for distinct macro-evolutionary trajectories. We propose that investigation of mixed state accumulation around important gene loci (such as Hox) will be crucial in capturing and further study of clade-specific regulatory innovations.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

The unique insights from a genome-level perspective have revealed a striking pattern of conserved macrosynteny within chromosomes across huge evolutionary distances in animals, yet progress in many lineages has been hampered by the absence of genome-level data. Here, we show that the tectonics of genome evolution in clitellates, a clade composed of most freshwater and all terrestrial species of the phylum Annelida, is characterised by extensive genome-wide scrambling that resulted in a massive loss of macrosynteny between marine annelids and clitellates, to the point that ancient bilaterian linkage groups (ie, groups of genes inherited as a block in most bilaterian phyla) are fully disrupted. These massive rearrangements included the formation of putative neocentromeres with newly-acquired transposable elements, and preceded a further period of genome-wide reshaping events including whole-genome duplications and massive macrosyntenic reshuffling between clitellate lineages, potentially triggered by the loss of genes involved in genome stability or homeostasis of cell division. Notably, while these rearrangements broke short-range interactions observed between genes in marine annelids (including Hox), they were reformed as long-range interactions in clitellates. These genomic rearrangements gave rise to new genetic elements that may have facilitated the adaptation to freshwater and terrestrial environments in clitellates. Our findings provide evidence of a massive genomic reshaping through genome-wide chromosome scrambling in clitellates consistent with the punctuated equilibrium model, which sharply contrasts with the highly conserved chromosomal architecture observed in most animal taxa. Our study thus suggests that the genomic landscape of this animal lineage resulted from a rare burst of genomic changes that ended a long period of stability that persists across large evolutionary distances.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

We hypothesized that the numerous genomic rearrangements could reposition active enhancers near proto-oncogenes, leading to their aberrant expression. We developed pyjacker, a computational tool for the detection of enhancer hijacking events, and applied it to a cohort of 39 ckAML samples. Pyjacker identified motor neuron and pancreas homeobox 1 (MNX1), a gene aberrantly expressed in 1.4% of AML patients, often as a result of del(7)(q22q36) associated with hijacking of a CDK6 enhancer. MNX1-activated cases show significant co-occurrence with BCOR mutations and a gene signature shared with t(7;12)(q36;p13) pediatric AML. We demonstrated that MNX1 is a dependency gene, as its knockdown in a xenograft model reduces leukemia cell fitness. In conclusion, enhancer hijacking is a frequent mechanism for oncogene activation in AML.

Statement of significanceThis study examines the consequences of structural alterations and demonstrates that proto-oncogene activation by enhancer hijacking is an overlooked pathomechanism in AML. MNX1 overexpression demonstrates that deletions on chromosome 7q can not only lead to haploinsufficiency, but also to activation of oncogenes by enhancer hijacking, providing a novel leukemogenic mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

As the foundation for lifelong mental health is established during childhood and adolescence, early prevention and treatment of mental health problems, such as through psychotherapy, are crucial. In Germany, current outpatient psychotherapeutic care capacities appear inadequate, while systematic evaluations of the care situation are lacking. This study investigates the state of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany and evaluates various methodological approaches for its assessment. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Publications from January 2018 to December 2023 were sourced from PubPsych, PubMed, APA PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. Included studies reported quantitative primary data on the mental health of community samples of children and adolescents in Germany or their outpatient psychotherapeutic care. We included 41 publications comprising epidemiological studies, administrative data, and psychotherapist and patient reports. A lack of systematic and standardized research approaches resulted in significant variance in data. Nonetheless, qualitative analysis revealed that approximately one four children and adolescents in Germany is affected by mental health problems, while one in six to seven children and adolescents requires psychotherapeutic treatment. Yet, only up to one in fifty receives guideline-based psychotherapy. Most requests for initial psychotherapeutic consultations are unmet, with waiting times for guideline-based psychotherapy exceeding six months for at least half of the patients. Overall, our findings suggest that outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany is still insufficient. They advocate for a systematic, multimodal, and longitudinal assessment of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care, along with an expansion of treatment capacities to enhance access for children and adolescents in Germany.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

We aimed to examine if a diverse set of biomarkers in the REHAB-HF trial would predict improvement in physical function following a 12-week tailored physical therapy rehabilitation intervention compared to attention control. Methods: The study population consisted of participants [&ge;]60 years of age who were hospitalized with acute HF and randomized to a subsequent multidomain outpatient physical rehabilitation intervention vs. attention control with outcomes of 12-week functional change including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Blood was collected prior to randomization and at 12-weeks for cardiac, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers. Linear trends across progressively higher biomarker values versus improvement in functional outcomes based on treatment assignment were evaluated. Classification and regression trees (CART) were created to estimate optimal biomarker levels associated with differential improvement in the two functional outcomes. Results: A total of 242 of 349 participants (69%) had baseline biomarkers measured. In an adjusted regression model, higher baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) I and T were associated with greater gains in SPPB and 6MWD respectively with the rehabilitation intervention (P=0.04 and 0.03 for interaction) versus attention control. In the CART analysis of the physical rehabilitation and attention control participants, those with baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and hs-cTnT [&ge;]36 ng/L receiving the rehabilitation intervention had a 129 m (95% CI 78-180m) greater 12-week 6MWD increase vs attention control. In contrast, for participants with CRP<9.9 mg/L there was no significant incremental 6MWD difference (30m, 95% CI -0.5m, 60.2m). For SPPB, a CRP [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and creatinine [&ge;]1.4 mg/dL optimally identified a differential improvement with the rehabilitation intervention versus attention control. The biomarkers (except for creatinine) decreased by 12 weeks post hospitalization but with no differences based on treatment assignment. Conclusion: Higher baseline levels of biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and renal dysfunction identified older adults after a HF hospitalization with the greatest differential improvement in physical function with a rehabilitation intervention. Biomarkers may help clinicians predict the benefits of this treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

This study aimed to estimate the extent to which genetic pathways that are direct (via child genotype) and indirect (e.g., via parental phenotype) explain the well-established association between parent and child emotional problems. We leveraged data from seven European cohort studies with a combined population of Ntrios=15,475. Polygenic scores were calculated for parental and offspring neuroticism, as it represents a dispositional trait underlying emotional problems. Emotional problems in offspring were measured using validated scales across various developmental stages from early childhood to adulthood. We used neuroticism polygenic scores within a structural equation modelling framework to distinguish between direct genetic pathways from parental genotype to offspring outcome (acting through offspring genotype), and indirect genetic pathways (acting through parental phenotype and associated environment). Standard errors for direct genetic, indirect genetic and total effects were bootstrapped and meta-analyses pooled effect estimates at three developmental stages (childhood: 3-4 years, adolescence: 11-13 years, adulthood: 18+ years). We found evidence suggesting an indirect genetic pathway between mothers and child emotional problems during early childhood (pooled estimate, mean difference in child emotional problems score per 1SD increase in maternal PGS for neuroticism=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07). This association attenuated over child development, while direct genetic pathways strengthened. High attrition rates, measurement error and low variance explained by polygenic scores may have altered precision of the estimates, influencing the interpretation of the results. However, we provide the first multi-cohort study to provide evidence for an indirect genetic pathway from maternal neuroticism to early child emotional problems. This suggests that there are likely processes other than direct genetic pathways involved in the intergenerational transmission of emotional problems, highlighting the importance of timely support to prevent and reduce emotional issues in mothers as a preventative strategy for emotional difficulties.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

The symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not all specific to SARS-CoV-2. They can be triggered by a host of other conditions, such as influenza virus infection.

One strategy to obtain high yielding strains is to enhance the expression level of the gene(s) responsible for production of the product by inserting multiple copies of the gene-expression cassette. Typically, this is achieved by transforming non-homologous end-joining proficient strains with large amounts of a DNA vector, which randomly integrates in multiple copies at different loci, or more often, into a single locus with copies arranged as mixed orientation repeats. The majority of strains produced in this manner are unstable and substantial screening is necessary to identify strains with high and stable production. Moreover, the randomness of the insertion processes makes it difficult to determine how and where the copies are positioned in the genome. To this end, we envisioned that the instability of gene clusters made by the classical method is mostly due to the presence of a mixture of directly and inverted repeats. In such clusters, hairpins formed by inverted repeats may cause frequent recombinogenic lesions during replication to induce gene-expression cassette copy-loss by direct-repeat recombination. It is therefore possible that strains with gene-expression cassette clusters made solely by direct repeats would be more stable. Using Aspergillus nidulans as a model, we tested this idea and developed RoCi, a simple and efficient method to facilitate integration of multiple directly repeated gene-expression cassettes into a defined genomic locus through rolling-circle replication without pre-engineering requirements for strain preparation. In addition, we demonstrate that RoCi can be performed without E. coli based cloning, making it compatible with medium-high throughput experiments. Analyzing strains produced by RoCi, we have constructed strains bearing up to 68 mRFP GECs and we show that an mRFP multi-copy gene-array supports high and stable mRFP production for at least [~]150 generations on solid medium. In liquid culture we observed a minor average copy loss at 1 L scale. This loss could be eliminated by extending the gene-expression cassette with a crippled selection marker.

By applying this to 8433 West Eurasians who lived over the past 14000 years and 6510 contemporary people, we find an order of magnitude more genome-wide significant signals than previous studies: 347 independent loci with >99% probability of selection. Previous work showed that classic hard sweeps driving advantageous mutations to fixation have been rare over the broad span of human evolution, but in the last ten millennia, many hundreds of alleles have been affected by strong directional selection. Discoveries include an increase from ~0% to ~20% in 4000 years for the major risk factor for celiac disease at HLA-DQB1; a rise from ~0% to ~8% in 6000 years of blood type B; and fluctuating selection at the TYK2 tuberculosis risk allele rising from ~2% to ~9% from ~5500 to ~3000 years ago before dropping to ~3%. We identify instances of coordinated selection on alleles affecting the same trait, with the polygenic score today predictive of body fat percentage decreasing by around a standard deviation over ten millennia, consistent with the Thrifty Gene hypothesis that a genetic predisposition to store energy during food scarcity became disadvantageous after farming. We also identify selection for combinations of alleles that are today associated with lighter skin color, lower risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, slower health decline, and increased measures related to cognitive performance (scores on intelligence tests, household income, and years of schooling). These traits are measured in modern industrialized societies, so what phenotypes were adaptive in the past is unclear. We estimate selection coefficients at 9.9 million variants, enabling study of how Darwinian forces couple to allelic effects and shape the genetic architecture of complex traits.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

In this updated systematic review, we evaluate new evidence since our 2019 systematic review on the effect of outdoor air pollution exposure on childhood and adolescent brain structure and function as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: Using PubMed and Web of Science, we conducted an updated literature search and systematic review of articles published through March 2024, using key terms for air pollution and functional and/or structural MRI. Two raters independently screened all articles using Covidence and implemented the risk of bias instrument for systematic reviews informing the World Health Organization Global Air Quality Guidelines. Results: We identified 222 relevant papers, and 14 new studies met our inclusion criteria. Including six studies from our 2019 review, the 20 publications to date include study populations from the United States, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Studies investigated exposure periods spanning pregnancy through early adolescence, and estimated air pollutant exposure levels via personal monitoring, geospatial residential estimates, or school courtyard monitors. Brain MRI occurred when children were on average 6-14.7 years old; however, one study assessed newborns. Several MRI modalities were leveraged, including structural morphology, diffusion tensor imaging, restriction spectrum imaging, arterial spin labeling, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as resting-state and task-based functional MRI. Air pollutants were associated with widespread brain differences, although the magnitude and direction of findings are largely inconsistent, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions. Conclusion: Prenatal and childhood exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with structural and functional brain variations. Compared to our initial 2019 review, publications doubled - an increase that testifies to the importance of this public health issue. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of developmental timing, along with the downstream implications of outdoor air pollution exposure on children's cognitive and mental health.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Even when effective vaccines became available, many communities remained at high risk of surges in COVID-19-related hospitalizations due to waning immunity, low uptake of booster vaccinations, and the continual emergence of new variations of SARS-CoV-2. Some risk metrics, such as the CDCs Community Levels, were developed to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the community-level healthcare system based on routine surveillance data. However, they had limited utility as they were not routinely updated based on accumulating data and were not directly linked to specific outcomes, such as surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations beyond local capacities. Regression models could resolve these limitations, but they have limited interpretability and do not convey the reasoning behind their predictions. In this paper, we evaluated decision tree classifiers that were developed in ""real-time"" to predict surges in local hospitalizations due to COVID-19 between July 2020 and November 2022. These classifiers would have provided visually intuitive and interpretable decision rules for local decision-makers to understand and act upon, and by being updated weekly, would have responded to changes in the epidemic. We showed that these classifiers exhibit reasonable predictive ability with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) > 80%. These classifiers maintained their performance temporally (i.e, over the duration of the pandemic) and spatially (i.e., across US counties). We also showed that these classifiers outperformed the CDCs Community Levels for predicting high hospital occupancy.

Significance StatementA major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic was the risk of exceeding local healthcare capacity due to COVID-19-related hospitalizations. To assess this risk and inform mitigating strategies, several risk assessment tools were developed during the pandemic. Many of these tools, however, did not predict local outcomes, were not updated as the pandemic progressed, and/or were not interpretable by decision-makers. We propose an adaptive framework of decision tree classifiers to predict whether COVID-19-related hospital occupancy would exceed a given capacity threshold. This framework would provide interpretable classification rules to predict surges in local hospitalizations,and maintained its performance over time and across US counties, and outperformed the CDCs Community Level tool.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Improved understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases is required to develop novel biomarkers and targeted treatments. Moreover, it is unclear whether shared or distinct pathogenic processes underpin the LVV spectrum. To address this, we performed plasma proteomic profiling, quantifying 184 plasma proteins using Olink immunoassays in two independent cohorts totalling 405 individuals. In Cohort 1, comparison of patients with TAK (N=96) and large vessel-GCA (LV-GCA) (N=35) versus healthy controls (HCs) (N=35) revealed 52 and 72 significant differentially abundant proteins, respectively. Correlation with disease activity status identified novel TAK and LV-GCA disease activity markers. Cohort 2 consisted of patients presenting acutely with possible cranial GCA (C-GCA); C-GCA was subsequently confirmed (n=150) or excluded (n=89). 31 proteins were associated with C-GCA. Analyses stratified by temporal artery biopsy results revealed enrichment of the proteomic signal in biopsy-proven GCA, suggesting the presence of distinct endotypes within C-GCA. Cross-disease comparison revealed that active TAK, LV-GCA and biopsy-proven C-GCA had highly similar plasma proteomic profiles. Twenty-six proteomic associations were shared across all three groups including IL6, monocyte/macrophage related proteins (CCL5, CCL7, CSF1), tissue remodelling proteins (VEGFA, TIMP1, TNC) and proteins not previously linked to LVV (TNFSF14, IL7R). We also observed disease-specific associations including increased CXCL9 in LV-GCA and C-GCA but not in TAK and decreases in the extracellular matrix protein COMP in TAK but not in LV-GCA or C-GCA. Evaluation of publicly available transcriptomic data from LV-GCA aortic tissue revealed that 47 of the 112 proteins significantly altered in [&ge;]1 LVV type had significantly altered mRNA expression in LVV aortic tissue. Similarities in LVV proteomic profiles suggest shared pathobiology involving innate immunity, particularly monocyte/macrophages, lymphocyte homeostasis and tissue remodelling processes. Our results highlight a signature of immune-stromal cross talk in LVV and identify potential novel therapeutic targets in this axis (e.g. TNFSF14). The correspondence of plasma signatures to tissue phenotype highlights the potential for non-invasive monitoring of arterial inflammation and injury.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Considerable disagreement exists in who is most at risk of developing Long COVID, driven in part by incomplete coding of a Long COVID diagnosis in medical records.

MethodsThis was a retrospective observational cohort study using an integrated primary and secondary care dataset from North West London, covering over 2.7 million patients. Patients with Long COVID were identified through clinical terms in their primary care record. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with having Long COVID diagnosis, while multivariate quantile regression was used to identify factors predicting the time a Long COVID diagnosis was recorded.

FindingsA total of 6078 patients were identified with a Long COVID clinical term in their primary care record, 0.33% of the total registered adult population. Women, those aged 41 to 70 years or of Asian ethnicity were more likely to have a recorded Long COVID diagnosis, alongside those with pre-existing anxiety, asthma, depressive disorder or eczema and those living outside of the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Men, those aged 41 to 70 years, or of black ethnicity were diagnosed earlier in the pandemic, while those with depressive disorder were diagnosed later.

InterpretationLong COVID is poorly coded in primary care records, and significant differences exist between patient groups in the likelihood of receiving a Long COVID diagnosis. Long COVID is more likely in those with pre-existing long-term conditions and is also associated with the frequent incidence of new long-term conditions. The experience of patients with Long COVID provides a crucial insight into inequities in access to timely care for complex multisystem conditions, and the importance of effective health informatics practices to provide robust, timely analytical support for front-line clinical services.

PINK1 is activated upon mitochondrial damage to phosphorylate Ubiquitin and Parkin to trigger removal of damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy). PINK1 also indirectly phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases including Rab8A. We have performed an siRNA screen targeting all human Ser/Thr kinases in HeLa cells and discovered that knockdown of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 1 (EIF2AK1), also known as heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, a branch of the integrated stress response (ISR), selectively enhances mitochondrial depolarization-induced stabilization of PINK1 and increased phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Rab8A. We confirm our findings in multiple human cell lines, including SK-OV-3, U2OS and ARPE-19 cells. Knockdown of the upstream mitochondrial-cytosol relay component, DELE1, enhanced PINK1 stabilisation and activation similar to EIF2AK1 knockdown. Strikingly, we demonstrate that the small molecule ISR inhibitor, ISRIB, also enhances PINK1 activation and signaling under conditions of mitochondrial damage. Using the mito-QC mitophagy reporter in human cells, we observe that EIF2AK1 knockdown or ISRIB treatment significantly enhances PINK1-dependent mitophagy but does not alter deferiprone-induced mitophagy. Our findings indicate that the DELE1-EIF2AK1 ISR signaling relay is a negative regulator of PINK1-dependent mitophagy and suggest that inhibitors of DELE1-EIF2AK1 and/or ISRIB analogues could have therapeutic benefits in PD and related disorders.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

Lacking recent comprehensive reviews, the field of Hill-type modelling is, however, dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of Hill-type muscle modelling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and critically discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential future directions in Hill-type modelling. For this purpose, fifty-seven criteria-abiding Hill-type models were assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle properties, and a modelling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the models, as well as their modelling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance beyond historical gold standards, (2) neglect the importance of parameter identification, (3) lack robust validation, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary material for navigating the literature, the results of this review highlight the need for global recommendations in Hill-type modelling to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transfer, and model reusability.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

This systematic review aims to summarize the central nervous system manifestations linked to monkeypox virus infection. Methods: We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched up to September 2024. Inclusion criteria focused on monkeypox virus-positive patients with confirmed central nervous system inflammatory disorders, including encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis, and related neuroimmune diseases. Results: From 770 screened articles, 38 studies were included. Of the 20 reported monkeypox virus-infected cases with central nervous system involvement, the most common manifestations were encephalitis (40%), encephalomyelitis (30%), and meningoencephalitis (10%). Additional rarer presentations included Guillain-Barre syndrome (5%) and transverse myelitis (5%). The mean age of affected individuals was 27.9 years, and 75% were male. Fever, fatigue, and myalgia were the predominant systemic symptoms, with neurological complications often appearing within 4.6 days post-infection. Diagnoses were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Treatment strategies varied, with antivirals (e.g., tecovirimat) and immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., methylprednisolone, immunoglobulins, and rituximab) utilized. Conclusions: Monkeypox virus infection is associated with severe neuroinflammatory disorders, with varying outcomes from complete recovery to mortality. Increased awareness, comprehensive diagnostic approaches, and targeted therapeutic interventions are critical in managing these cases. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in the monkeypox virus and establish standardized treatment protocols.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Recent work has highlighted the role of circulating lipoproteins in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We sought to triangulate human observational and genetic evidence to evaluate the role of Lp(a) in AAA. Methods: We tested the association between circulating levels of Lp(a) and clinically diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms while controlling for traditional AAA risk factors and levels of ApoB using logistic regression among 795 individuals with and 374,772 individuals without AAA in the UK Biobank (UKB). Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was used to test for putatively causal associations between Lp(a) and AAA controlling for ApoB. Genetic instruments for Lp(a) and ApoB were created from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Lp(a) and ApoB comprising 335,796 and 418,505 UKB participants, respectively. The instruments were tested for association with AAA using data from a GWAS of 39,221 individuals with and 1,086,107 without AAA. Results: Elevated Lp(a) levels were observationally associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.04 per 10 nmol/L Lp(a); 95%CI 1.02-1.05; P<0.01). Clinically elevated Lp(a) levels (>150nmol/L) were likewise associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.15-1.88; P < 0.01) when compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels <150nmol/L. MVMR confirmed a significant, ApoB-independent association between increased Lp(a) and increased risk of AAA (OR 1.13 per SD increase in Lp(a); 95%CI 1.02-1.24; P<0.02). Conclusion: Both observational and genetic analyses support an association between increased Lp(a) and AAA risk that is independent of ApoB. These findings suggest that Lp(a) may be a therapeutic target for AAA and drive the inclusion of AAA as an outcome in clinical trials of Lp(a) antagonists.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Here, we report the first introductions of Clade Ib into North Kivu province, including within internal displacement camps, with suspected close contact transmission that includes non-intimate contacts and children. These findings demonstrate that mpox case investigations and community messaging campaigns should include considerations for non-sexual contact-mediated transmission of Clade Ib that includes children <15 years.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and inflammatory proteins may contribute to the development of FM. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins (cytokines/chemokines), and FM using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and meta-analysis approaches. Methods: MR analyses were conducted using genetic data from European populations, employing methods such as MR-IVW, MR-Egger, and MR-weighted median. Reverse MR was also performed, with FM treated as the exposure. A meta-analysis was conducted to consolidate the findings. Results: Ruminococcus gauvreauii was identified as a risk factor for FM, while Enterorhabdus, Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, and Prevotella 9 were found to be protective. Five inflammatory proteins C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), S100-A12, Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), Monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2/CCL8), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-) exhibited protective associations, while Natural killer cell receptor 2B4 (NKCR-2B4/CD244) and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL-12{beta}) were associated with an increased risk of FM. Conclusion: This study highlights the role of gut microbiota and inflammatory proteins (cytokines/chemokines) in the pathogenesis of FM. Through Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, the findings suggest their involvement in immune regulation, inflammatory responses, and viral pathways. These findings provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for modulating gut health and immune responses, opening new avenues for future research and clinical interventions.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

We have previously reported that higher dose corticosteroids cause harm in patients with hypoxia but not receiving ventilatory support (non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation), but the balance of efficacy and safety in patients receiving ventilatory support is uncertain.

MethodsThis randomised, controlled, open-label platform trial (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy [RECOVERY]) assessed multiple possible treatments in patients hospitalised for COVID-19. Eligible and consenting adult patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated (1:1) to either usual care with higher dose corticosteroids (dexamethasone 20 mg once daily for 5 days followed by 10 mg once daily for 5 days or until discharge if sooner) or usual standard of care alone (which includes dexamethasone 6 mg once daily for 10 days or until discharge if sooner). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation and (among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline) the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding for the trial ended. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).

FindingsBetween 25 May 2021 and 9 January 2024, 477 COVID-19 patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids versus usual care alone (of whom 99% received corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomised, 221 (46%) were in Asia, 245 (51%) in the UK and 11 (2%) in Africa. 143 (30%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 86 (35%) of 246 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 86 (37%) of 231 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI 0.64-1.18; p=0.37). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (128 [52%] in the higher dose corticosteroids group vs 120 [52%] in the usual care group; RR 1.04, 0.81-1.33]; p=0.78). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (76 [37%] of 206 vs 93 [45%] of 205; RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63-1.00]; p=0.05).

InterpretationIn patients hospitalised for COVID-19 receiving ventilatory support, we found no evidence that higher dose corticosteroids reduced the risk of death compared to usual care, which included low dose corticosteroids.

However, SDOHs have often been studied in isolation.

ObjectiveTo identify distinct exposure profiles, estimate their associations with persistent distressing psychotic-like experiences (PLE), and evaluate whether involvement with physical activities partially explains this association.

Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis population-based study used data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Participants were recruited from 22 US sites between September 2016 and January 2022. Data from baseline and three follow-ups were included.

ExposuresArea-level geocoded variables spanning various domains of SDOH, including socioeconomic status (SES), education, crime, built environment, social context, and crime, were clustered using a self-organizing map method to identify exposure profiles.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresPersistent distressing PLE was derived from the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child Version across four years. Generalized linear mixed modeling tested the association between exposure profiles and persistent distressing PLE as well as physical activities (i.e., team and individual sports), adjusting for individual-level covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, highest level of parent education, family-relatedness, and study sites.

ResultsAmong 8,145 participants (baseline mean [SD] age, 9.92 [0.63] years; 3,868 (47.5%) females; 5,566 (68.3%) White, 956 (11.7%) Black, 159 (2.0%) Asian, and 1,480 (18.4%) Hispanic participants), five exposure profiles were identified. Compared to the reference Profile 1 (suburban affluent areas, 2521 children, 30.9%), Profile 3 (rural areas with low walkability and high ozone; 1459 children, 17.9%; adjusted OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.09--1.64) and Profile 4 (urban areas with high SES deprivation, high crime, and high pollution; 715 children, 8.8%; adjusted OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.08--1.81), were associated with persistent distressing PLE. Team sports mediated 6.14% of the association for Profile 3.

Conclusion and RelevanceThis study found that neighborhoods characterized by rural areas with low walkability and urban areas with high socioeconomic deprivation, air pollutants, and crime were associated with persistent distressing PLE. Further research is needed to explore the pathways through which different environmental factors may impact the development of psychosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

However, the current gold standard of short-read, Illumina-based WGS is labor and time-intensive. In light of recent improvements in long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, we sought to establish a low resource utilization approach capable of providing accurate WGS-based comparisons of HAI pathogens within a time frame allowing for infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions.

MethodsWGS was prospectively performed on antimicrobial-resistant pathogens at increased risk of potential healthcare transmission using the ONT MinION sequencer with R10.4.1 flow cells and Dorado basecalling algorithm. Potential transmission was assessed via Ridom SeqSphere+ for core genome multilocus sequence typing and MINTyper for reference-based core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms using previously published cut-off values. The accuracy of our ONT pipeline was determined relative to Illumina-based WGS data generated from the same genomic DNA sample.

ResultsOver a six-month period, 242 bacterial isolates from 216 patients were sequenced by a single operator. Compared to the Illumina gold-standard data, our ONT pipeline achieved a Q score of 60 for assembled genomes, even with a coverage rate of as low as 40X. The mean time from initiating DNA extraction to complete genetic analysis was 2 days (IQR 2-3.25 days). We identified five potential transmission clusters comprising 21 isolates (8.7% of all sequenced strains). Combining ONT WGS data with epidemiological data, >70% (15/21) of the isolates originated from patients with potential healthcare transmission links.

ConclusionsVia a stand-alone ONT pipeline, we detected potentially transmitted HAI pathogens rapidly and accurately, aligning closely with epidemiological data. Our low-resource method has the potential to assist in the efficient detection and deployment of preventative measures against HAI transmission.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

""Pegasus"" volans is an extremely elongate and slender animal, with long anal and dorsal fins and a very well-developed first dorsal-fin ray reminiscent to the vexillum of some modern teleost larvae. Most striking is its extreme ventral projection of the pelvic girdle (basipterygium), associated with an element of the pectoral girdle (a long process of the coracoid) and developed pelvic-fin rays. The strongly reduced abdominal region suggests that ""Pegasus"" volans had an external gut, once again reminiscent of those of certain larval teleosts. The unique character state combination displayed by ""Pegasus"" volans make it impossible to assign it to a specific subclade within perch-like spiny-rayed fishes (Percomorpha). Nevertheless, it offers a valuable perspective on the diversity of morphologies and ecological niches occupied by teleost fishes of the early Eocene Bolca fauna.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

Recent advances in wholemount immunolabelling and 3D imaging have provided insights into organ-specific heterogeneity of lymphatic structure and function. However, the visualisation of lymphatic vessels deep within an intact organ remains a challenge. We hypothesised that nanobodies, single-domain antibodies raised in camelid species, would result in improved labelling of lymphatics in intact mouse organs, without loss of information due to organ sectioning or inadequate penetration. We generated and characterised nanobody clones targeting lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), a marker of lymphatic capillaries. Nanobodies were superior at penetrating whole mouse organs and enhanced labelling of lymphatics compared with a conventional anti-LYVE1 polyclonal antibody. Utilising this new tool, we found that kidney lymphatics; an organ in which labelling of lymphatics is challenging, have spatially restricted LYVE1 expression compared with lymphatics of skin, heart, and lung. The timing of this LYVE1 spatial restriction coincides with the early postnatal period in mice.

In particular, clustering remains one of the most common tools to dissect the chemical space. Unfortunately, most current approaches present unfavorable time and memory scaling, which makes them unsuitable to handle million- and billion-sized sets. Here, we propose to bypass these problems with a time- and memory-efficient clustering algorithm, BitBIRCH. This method uses a tree structure similar to the one found in the Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies (BIRCH) algorithm to ensure O(N) time scaling. BitBIRCH leverages the instant similarity (iSIM) formalism to process binary fingerprints, allowing the use of Tanimoto similarity, and reducing memory requirements. Our tests show that BitBIRCH is already > 1,000 times faster than standard implementations of the Taylor-Butina clustering for libraries with 1,500,000 molecules. BitBIRCH increases efficiency without compromising the quality of the resulting clusters. We explore strategies to handle large sets, which we applied in the clustering of one billion molecules under 5 hours using a parallel/iterative BitBIRCH approximation.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

We address this central issue by investigating the RNA binding activity of the Drosophila Hox TF Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in alternative splicing and morphogenesis. Relying on molecular and genetic interactions, we uncover a homodimerization-dependent mechanism by which Ubx regulates splicing. Notably, this mechanism enables the decoupling of Ubx-DNA and -RNA binding activity in splicing. We identify a critical residue for Ubx-RNA binding and demonstrate the essential role of Ubx-RNA binding ability for its homeotic functions. Overall, we uncover a unique mechanism for Ubx-mediated splicing and underscore the critical contribution of synergistic DNA/RNA binding for its morphogenetic functions. These findings advance our understanding of co-transcriptional regulation and highlight the significance of TF-DNA/RNA synergistic function in shaping gene regulatory networks in living organisms.

MR relies on a set of assumptions to obtain unbiased effect estimates, one of these assumptions is that there is no pathway from the genetic variants to the outcome that does not act through the exposure. Increasing genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes for the exposure enables discovery of instrumental variables with smaller effect sizes. We illustrate through simulations how smaller effect sizes could arise from genetic variants that act through traits that have greater liability to confound an exposure-outcome relationship. When such genetic variants are selected as instruments this can bias the MR effect estimate obtained from that instrument in the same direction as the confounded observational association but with larger magnitude. Through simulation we illustrate how the total bias of the MR estimates increases across a range of standard MR estimation methods increases as the proportion of the genetic instruments that are associated with the confounder increases. However, if such heritable confounders are known and can be instrumented, the confounder free effect estimate can be obtained through applying a pre-estimation filtering to standard MR methods, removing instruments that explain more variation in that confounder than the exposure, or by estimating effects through multivariable MR. We highlight the potential for SNPs identified in GWAS to be associated with potential confounders through examination of a recent GWAS of C-Reactive Protein. Finally, we illustrate our approach through estimation of the causal effect of age at menarche on type 2 diabetes, hypothesising that the MR effect estimate may be biased by confounding due to the inclusion of genetic variants associated with early life adiposity as instruments.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

DesignRetrospective cross-sectional study.

Participants5,351 patients (9,564 eyes) who underwent macular OCT imaging and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) tests (24-2 or 10-2 test patterns) at a university hospital from 2006 to 2023. The dataset included 47,653 paired OCT-VF data points, including various ocular conditions.

MethodsWe trained a segmentation-free 3DCNN model based on the EfficientNet3D-b0 architecture on a comprehensive OCT dataset to estimate VF. We evaluated the models performance using Pearsons correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. We assessed residual variability using a jackknife resampling approach and compared OCT-VF and HFA datasets using generalized estimating equations (GEE), adjusting the number of VF tests, follow-up duration, age, and clustering by eye and patient.

Main Outcome MeasuresCorrelations between estimated and measured VF thresholds and mean deviations (MDs), and residual variability of OCT-VF and HFA.

ResultsWe observed strong correlations between the estimated and measured VF parameters (Pearsons r: 24-2 thresholds 0.893, MD 0.932; 10-2 thresholds 0.902, MD 0.945; all p < 0.001). Bland-Altman analysis showed good agreement between the estimated and measured MD, with a slight proportional bias. GEE analysis demonstrated significantly lower residual variability for OCT-VF than for HFA (24-2 thresholds: 1.10 vs. 2.48 dB; 10-2 thresholds: 1.20 vs. 2.48 dB; all p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected), with lower variability across all test points, severities, and ages, thus highlighting the robustness of the segmentation-free 3DCNN approach in a heterogeneous clinical sample.

ConclusionsA segmentation-free 3DCNN model objectively estimated VF from OCT images with high accuracy and significantly lower residual variability than subjective HFA measurements in a heterogeneous clinical sample, including patients with glaucoma and individuals with other ocular diseases. The improved reliability, lower variability, and objective nature of OCT-VF highlight its value for enhancing VF assessment and monitoring of various ocular conditions, potentially facilitating earlier detection of progression and more efficient disease management.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to be about spelling (0% vs 23.6%), locations (1.2% vs 16.3%), or title/degree (0% vs 10.6%), and more likely to be about a vaccine/vaccination (21.2% vs 0.3%), incidence/cases of conditions (12.2% vs 0.3%), or disease testing (7.8% vs 0.3%; p<0.001).

Compared to corrections not pertaining to COVID-19, corrections pertaining to COVID-19 were less likely to result in an equivocal tone (16.7% vs 88.8%), but they were more likely to both overstate (54.7% vs 8.5%) and understate (23.7% vs 2.4%) the situation in the original text (p<0.001). Ten reporters (of 346) accounted for 24% of the corrections. The reporter with the single most corrections accounted for 7% of the corrections.

ConclusionsDifferential tone of the corrections suggests bias in the reporting of COVID-19 topics in a top news outlet. The reporting of unbiased information is a first step in addressing issues of misinformation in public health messaging.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

To date, the cnidarian Turritopsis dohrnii is the only known species capable of undergoing reverse development after the onset of sexual reproduction. Here, we demonstrate that the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi is capable of reversal from mature lobate to early cydippid when fed following a period of stress. Our findings illuminate central aspects of ctenophore development, ecology, and evolution, and show the high potential of M. leidyi as a new model system to study reverse development and rejuvenation. Besides shedding light on the plasticity of developmental programs, our results raise fundamental questions about early animal development, body plans and life cycles.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971
"The aging musician: Evidence of a downward trend in song tempo as a function of artist age","10.1101/2024.06.29.601154","biorxiv",42.5,0,0,8,16,"Luck, G.; Ansani, A.","Geoff Luck","University of Jyväskylä","2024-07-02","1","new results","cc_by","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/07/02/2024.06.29.601154.source.xml","Correspondences between the timing of motor behavior and that of musical performance are well-established. Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed. Our findings highlight a significant gap in understanding of creative performance across the lifespan, particularly the role of age as a mediating factor in musical tempo. Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

Traditional dynamic disease modeling is an essential tool for characterization and prediction, but often requires extensive expertise and specialized software, which may not be readily available in low-resource environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an AI-powered modeling assistant that utilizes advanced capabilities from OpenAIs latest models and functionality. This tool enhances the accessibility and usability of infectious disease models and simulation frameworks by allowing users to generate or modify model configurations through intuitive natural language inputs or by importing explicit model descriptions. Our prototype integrates with an established open-source disease simulation framework called the Compartmental Modeling Software (CMS) to provide a seamless modeling experience from setup to analysis. The AI assistant efficiently interprets disease model parameters, constructs accurate model files, executes simulations in a controlled environment, and assists in result interpretation using advanced analytics tools. It encapsulates expert knowledge and adheres to best practices to support users ranging from novices to expert modelers. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of this AI assistant, particularly its performance in complex scenarios where it might generate inaccurate specifications. By enhancing the ease of disease modeling and supporting ongoing capacity-building initiatives, we believe that AI assistants like this one could significantly contribute to global health efforts by empowering researchers, especially in regions with limited resources, to develop and refine their disease models independently. This innovative approach has the potential to democratize disease modeling in global health, offering a scalable solution that adapts to diverse needs across a wide-range of geographies, languages, and populations.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

DWV infects bees at all life stages, but is most noticeable in adult bees, where clinical symptoms include shriveled, non-functional wings, and a drastically shortened lifespan. DWV is recorded in upwards of 90% of honey bee colonies worldwide, and has been linked to colony loss in symptomatic hives. DWV is primarily spread by Varroa destructor mites, who feed on the fat bodies of honey bee adults and pupae. There is currently no direct treatment or preventative for DWV, with the primary method of reduction being vector control using acaracides. In this study, we tested the effect that vaccinating honey bee queens using killed Paenibacillus larvae bacterin, the causative agent of the honey bee disease American Foulbrood, had on deformed wing virus load in honey bee colonies. We placed vaccinated queens in 200 honey bee colonies, and unvaccinated queens in 200 colonies, and measured quantities of DWV-B in both groups immediately before, and 4 months after vaccination. We found that levels of DWV-B were identical before vaccination, but were significantly reduced in colonies 4 months post vaccination. This change was found despite no difference in mite quantities between groups. Overall, these data provide evidence that vaccination of queens with P. larvae bacterin is an effective method for reduction of DWV-B quantities in honey bee colonies in a commercially relevant field setting.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

ME diagnosis is hindered by the absence of robustly-defined and specific biomarkers that are easily measured from available sources such as blood, and unaffected by ME patients low level of physical activity. Previous studies of blood biomarkers have not yielded replicated results, perhaps due to low study sample sizes (n < 100). Here, we use UK Biobank (UKB) data for up to 1,455 ME cases and 131,303 population controls to discover hundreds of molecular and cellular blood traits that differ significantly between cases and controls. Importantly, 116 of these traits are replicated, as they are significant for both female and male cohorts. Our analysis used semi-parametric efficient estimators, an initial Super Learner fit followed by a one-step correction, three types of mediators, and natural direct and indirect estimands, to decompose the average effect of ME status on molecular and cellular traits. Strikingly, these trait differences cannot be explained by ME cases restricted activity. Of 3,237 traits considered, ME status had a significant effect on only one, via the ""Duration of walk"" (UKB field 874) mediator. By contrast, ME status had a significant direct effect on 290 traits (9%). As expected, these effects became more significant with increased stringency of case and control definition. Significant female and male traits were indicative of chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and liver disease. Individually, significant effects on blood traits, however, were not sufficient to cleanly distinguish cases from controls. Nevertheless, their large number, lack of sex-bias, and strong significance, despite the  healthy volunteer selection bias of UKB participants, keep alive the future ambition of a blood-based biomarker panel for accurate ME diagnosis.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Debates about feather evolution hinge upon whether filamentous integument has evolved once or multiple time independently on the lineage leading to modern birds. These contradictory results stem from subjective methodological differences in statistical ancestral state estimates. Here we conduct a comprehensive comparison of ancestral state estimation methodologies applied to stem-group birds, testing the role of outgroup inclusion, tree time scaling method, model choice and character coding strategy. Models are compared based on their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), mutual information, as well as the uncertainty of marginal ancestral state estimates. Our results demonstrate that ancestral state estimates of stem-bird integument are strongly influenced by tree time scaling method, outgroup selection and model choice, while character coding strategy seems to have less effect on the ancestral estimates produced. We identify the best fitting models using AIC scores and a leave-one-out cross-validation approach (LOOCV). Our analyses broadly support the independent origin of filamentous integument in dinosaurs and pterosaurs and support a younger evolutionary origin of feathers than has been suggested previously. More generally, our study highlights that special care must be taken in selecting the outgroup, tree and model when conducting ASE analyses. With respect to model selection, our results suggest that considering a LOOCV approach, may yield more reliable results than simply comparing AIC scores when the analyses involve a limited number of taxa.","NA","biorxiv",1726524461971

METHODS170 plasma samples from University of British Columbia Hospital Clinic for Alzheimers (AD) and Related Disorders were analyzed for p-tau217 using Fujirebio and ALZpath assays. Decision points were determined using CSF testing and autopsy findings as the standard.

RESULTSFujirebio and ALZpath p-tau217 had similar overall analytical and clinical performance, with distinct decision points for each assay. Based on autopsy finding, both p-tau217 assays identified individuals with AD from other neurodegenerative diseases (ALZpath AUC = 0.94, Fujirebio AUC= 0.90). The ALZpath assay detected AD pathology at milder disease stages compared to the Fujirebio assay.

DISCUSSIONOur study reinforces the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as an AD biomarker. Differences in test performance and clinical decision points suggest an assay specific diagnostic approach is required for plasma p-tau217 in clinical practice.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

As IP occurs only in recall immune responses, we investigated the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of unvaccinated individual to determine whether their immune response aligned with the primary or recall immune response patterns.

Analysis of the Ig isotype response trajectories to the Mpro, NP, and S structural proteins and the S RBD in this group of 191 patients and 44 controls revealed a pattern of recall response in 94.2 % of cases. The levels of antibodies correlated positively with the severity of the condition rather than a milder course. High-resolution flow cytometry of fresh PBMNCs showed trajectories of plasmablasts, B cell subsets, and cTfh, suggesting a recall response. The transcriptomic profile demonstrated that this group was directly comparable to other contemporary cohorts. Overall, these findings support the idea that the response to SARS-CoV-2 is, in most cases, a recall response, likely due to B and T memory cells to CCCV, and therefore susceptible to immune imprinting and antibody-dependent enhancement.","NA","medrxiv",1726524461971

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.
