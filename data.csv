The results indicate that Omicron BA.1.1 and its pure reverse mutants were widely distributed throughout the United States from the early days of their emergence, showing a statistically significant difference compared to other major variants, which spread from a small number of sources. The peak emergence of BA.1.1 and BA.1.1.18 pure reverse mutants occurred a few weeks before the peak of all collected samples, whereas the peak of pure reverse mutants in major BA.1 variants and BA.2 coincides with the overall sampling peak. Although the peaks of BA.1.x collections are not all synchronous, the peaks of pure reverse mutants in the BA.1 lineage completely overlap, with the number of such mutants declining abruptly after the peak. These regional and temporal anomalies in the Omicron BA.1 lineage, especially in the BA.1.1 lineage, are virtually impossible to explain by current theories of natural mutation and spread by human-to-human infection.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

MethodsWe used Australian census data linked to the Australian Immunisation Register and death registrations to estimate COVID-19 booster effectiveness according to booster type and recency in adults aged 65+ years in Australia during August 2023-February 2024, a period dominated firstly by XBB-related SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants and then the BA.2.86-related JN.1. Survival analysis, adjusted for age, sex, and other sociodemographic and health measures, was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness.

ResultsWe followed 4.12 million adults aged 65+ years from 1 August 2023 to 29 February 2024. By 29 February, 581146 doses of the XBB.1.5 vaccine were administered, and 1620 COVID-19-specific deaths occurred. COVID-19 mortality rates were 72/100000 person-years in people who received a COVID-19 booster >365 days earlier, and 21/100000 in those who received the XBB.1.5 booster in the last 3 months. The relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of XBB.1.5 booster receipt in the last 3 months against COVID-19 mortality was 74.7% (95%CI 59.9-84.1%). The rVE for those receiving other booster types in the last 3 months was 51.6% (39.3-61.4%). Booster rVE against COVID-19 mortality waned. Compared to those who received a COVID-19 booster >365 days earlier, rVE for a booster within 3-6 months earlier was 31.2% (18.9-41.6%) and for a booster received 6-12 months earlier rVE was 13.1% (1.8-23.2%). rVE estimates were similar in analyses restricted to 1 December 2023 to 29 February 2024 when the dominant Omicron subvariant was JN.1.

ConclusionsRecent booster vaccination with the XBB.1.5 monovalent COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing COVID-19 mortality including in the period when the JN.1 subvariant circulated, supporting recommendations for 6-monthly boosting in older adults. Evaluation of vaccination effectiveness against other health outcomes, such as COVID-19 hospitalisations and ICU admission, would help further document vaccination benefits.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

During REM sleep, the brain's internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal? Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

In March 2024, the Food and Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use Authorization for pemivibart (Permagard/VYD222), an engineered human monoclonal antibody, for pre-exposure prophylaxis in this vulnerable population. However, SARS-CoV-2 has since evolved extensively, resulting in multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages. We therefore evaluated the in vitro neutralizing activity of pemivibart against the prevalent forms of JN.1, including KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, LB.1, and, importantly, KP.3.1.1, which is now expanding most rapidly. A panel of VSV-based pseudoviruses representing major JN.1 sublineages was generated to assess their susceptibility to pemivibart neutralization in vitro. Structural analyses were then conducted to understand the impact of specific spike mutations on the virus-neutralization results. Pemivibart neutralized both JN.1 and KP.2 in vitro with comparable activity, whereas its potency was decreased slightly against LB.1, KP.2.3, and KP.3 but substantially against KP.3.1.1. Critically, the 50% inhibitory concentration of pemivibart against KP.3.1.1 was [~]6 {micro}g/mL, or [~]32.7 fold higher than that of JN.1. Structural analyses suggest that Q493E and the S31-deletion mutations in viral spike contribute to the antibody evasion, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Our findings show that pemivibart has lost substantial neutralizing activity in vitro against KP.3.1.1, the most rapidly expanding lineage of SARS-CoV-2 today. Close monitoring of its clinical efficacy is therefore warranted. These results also highlight the imperative to expand our arsenal of preventive agents to protect millions of immunocompromised individuals who could not respond robustly to COVID-19 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

AlphaFold2 predictions revealed that RPA and TPP1 interact with telomerase at distinct binding sites. Using separation-of-function mutants, we discovered that RPA-mediated telomerase stimulation is indispensable for telomere elongation, while TPP1-POT1 primarily functions in recruiting telomerase to telomeres. Furthermore, we demonstrated that short telomere disease-associated telomerase mutations compromise RPA's ability to stimulate telomerase, establishing a link between impaired RPA-dependent processivity and telomeropathies. Our findings redefine human telomerase regulation by establishing RPA as a critical regulator and provide new insights into the molecular basis of telomere-related diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Large-scale studies have been able to detect genetic variants with contributions to height in the range of approximately 1.2 millimetre per allele copy on average. Non-additive genetic interactions may, in part, account for the difference between broad-sense and narrow-sense heritability estimates. However, prior studies have failed to identify variants with non-additive effects, possibly due to the lack of statistical power. Leveraging 3.6M individuals of European genetic ancestry in the 23andMe research cohort, we performed a genome-wide analysis study (GWAS) to select 1,063 independent common SNPs associated with height (p-value < 5e-8), and then screened for evidence of non-additive effects by analysing 564,453 models including a pairwise SNP-SNP interaction term. We identified 69 pairwise models with suggestive evidence of SNP-SNP interaction (p-value < 1e-4) and, for each SNP pair, we evaluated a fully saturated model including additive, dominant, and epistatic (additive-by-additive, additive-by-dominance and dominance-by-dominance) terms. We tested for the presence of epistatic interactions by comparing models with and without epistatic terms using a likelihood ratio test. Assuming a strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 8.9e-8 (0.05/564,453), we found no evidence of epistatic interactions (Likelihood ratio test (LRT) p-value < 9e-07 for all models). Our analysis rules out the existence of epistatic interactions between alleles of >1% frequency with effect sizes larger than 2.42mm. Our large-scale analysis provides further evidence of the minimal contribution of non-additivity in the genetic architecture of adult human height.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

One limitation of using TPD therapeutically is that most E3 ligases have broad tissue expression, which can contribute to toxicity via target degradation in healthy cells. Many pathogenic and oncogenic viruses encode E3 ligases (vE3s), which de facto have strictly limited expression to diseased cells. Here, we provide proof-of-concept for Viral E3 Pan-Essential Removing Targeting Chimeras (VIPER-TACs) that are bi-functional molecules that utilize viral E3 ubiquitin ligases to selectively degrade pan-essential proteins and eliminate diseased cells. We find that the human papillomavirus (HPV) ligase E6 can degrade the SARS1 pan-essential target protein in a model of HPV-positive cervical cancer to selectively kill E6 expressing cancer cells. Thus, VIPER-TACs have the capacity to dramatically increase the therapeutic window, alleviate toxicity concerns, and ultimately expand the potential target space for TPD.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Dysfunction in different networks is proposed to associate with distinct symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the specific networks targeted by current clinical transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) approaches are unclear. While standard-of-care TMS relies on scalp-based landmarks, recent FDA-approved TMS protocols use individualized functional connectivity with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to optimize TMS targeting. Leveraging previous work on precision network estimation and recent advances in network-level TMS targeting, we demonstrate that clinical TMS approaches target different functional networks between individuals. Homotopic scalp positions (left F3 and right F4) target different networks within and across individuals, and right F4 generally favors a right-lateralized control network. We also modeled the impact of targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) zone anticorrelated with the sgACC and found that the individual-specific anticorrelated region variably targets a network coupled to reward circuitry. Combining individualized, precision network mapping and electric field (E-field) modeling, we further illustrate how modeling can be deployed to prospectively target distinct closely localized association networks in the dlPFC with meaningful spatial selectivity and E-field intensity. Lastly, our findings emphasize differences between selectivity and maximal intensity, highlighting the need to consider both metrics in precision TMS efforts.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

Individuals with pathological MAPT variants exhibit behavioural changes, cognitive impairment and signs of parkinsonism. Missense mutations of residue P301, which are the most common MAPT mutations associated with FTDP-17, give rise to the assembly of mutant four-repeat tau into filamentous inclusions, in the absence of extracellular deposits. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of tau filaments from five individuals belonging to three unrelated families with mutation P301L and from one individual belonging to a family with mutation P301T.

Two different tau folds were found in the case with mutation P301T, the less abundant of which was a variant of the three-lobed fold. The major P301T tau fold was V-shaped, with partial similarity to the four-layered tau folds of corticobasal degeneration and argyrophilic grain disease.

Manual scoring of liver biopsies, currently the gold standard for clinical trial enrollment and endpoint assessment, suffers from high reader variability. This study represents the most comprehensive multi-site analytical and clinical validation of an AI-based pathology system, Artificial Intelligence-based Measurement of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (AIM-NASH), to assist pathologists in MASH trial histology scoring. AIM-NASH demonstrated high repeatability and reproducibility compared to manual scoring. AIM-NASH-assisted reads by expert MASH pathologists were superior to unassisted reads in accurately assessing inflammation, ballooning, NAS >= 4 with >=1 in each score category, and MASH resolution, while maintaining non-inferiority in steatosis and fibrosis assessment. These findings suggest AIM-NASH could mitigate reader variability, providing a more reliable assessment of therapeutics in MASH clinical trials.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

To better understand the molecular and functional changes associated with TREM2 signalling, we generated a TREM2 reporter mouse model and observed a gradual upregulation of reporter expression with increasing plaque proximity. Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA-sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of A{beta} pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, we performed chronic treatment with a brain penetrant TREM2 agonist and identified a window of TREM2 expression where microglia are most responsive. Thus, our data provide novel insights into TREM2-mediated regulation of microglial metabolic function and informs current efforts to bring TREM2 agonists into clinical application.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

This has led to breakthrough infections (BTI) in vaccinated individuals, with a large proportion of the neutralizing antibody response targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein. Immune imprinting, where prior exposure of an antigen to the immune system can influence the response to subsequent exposures, and its role in a population with heterogenous exposure histories has important implications in future vaccine design. Here, we develop an accessible approach to map epitope immunodominance of the neutralizing antibody response in sera. By using a panel of mutant Spike in a pseudovirus neutralization assay, we observed distinct epitope usage in convalescent donors infected during wave 1, or infected with the Delta, or BA.1 variants, highlighting the antigenic diversity of the variant Spikes. Analysis of longitudinal serum samples taken spanning 3 doses of vaccine and subsequent breakthrough infection (BTI), showed the influence of immune imprinting from the ancestral-based vaccine, where reactivation of existing B cells elicited by the vaccine resulted in the enrichment of the pre-existing epitope immunodominance. However, subtle shifts in epitope usage in sera were observed following BTI by Omicron sub-lineage variants. Antigenic distance of Spike, time after last exposure, and number of vaccine boosters may play a role in the persistence of imprinting from the vaccine. This study provides insight into RBD neutralizing epitope usage in individuals with varying exposure histories and has implications for design of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Author SummaryThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants has resulted in a rise in breakthrough infections (BTIs). Infection with different variants has led to varying exposure histories in the general population. Although the neutralizing response to Spike has been thoroughly characterized, with several key epitopes identified, there is a lack of knowledge of the proportion each epitope contributes to the neutralizing response in sera and how this is affected by exposure history. Here, we use a panel of mutant Spike pseudoviruses to screen epitope usage and immunodominance in polyclonal sera. In a cohort of unvaccinated donors infected with different variants, distinct epitope usage was observed, highlighting the antigenic diversity between the variant Spikes. Furthermore, samples collected spanning multiple vaccine doses and BTI showed the influence of prior immunity from the vaccine on epitope usage. Although a large proportion of the immune response following BTI could be attributed to enrichment of pre-existing immunodominance from the vaccine, subtle shifts in epitope usage were observed with infection by more mutated variants. This work gives more detailed insight into differences in the neutralizing response of individuals with varying exposure histories that may inform next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

How such mutualism has evolved between originally unrelated organisms is of interest. Here we report that, using an experimental symbiotic system between the stinkbug Plautia stali and the model bacterium Escherichia coli, disruption of a single bacterial gene tnaA encoding tryptophanase makes E. coli mutualistic to P. stali. Survey of natural bacterial mutualists across wild populations of P. stali and other stinkbug species uncovered that their Pantoea-allied symbionts consistently lack tnaA gene. Some Pantoea species like P. ananatis retain tnaA gene and cannot establish symbiosis with P. stali, but tnaA-disrupted P. ananatis partially restored the symbiotic capability. When a natural Pantoea mutualist of P. stali was transformed with a functional tna operon, its symbiotic capability reduced significantly. Our finding suggests that tryptophanase disruption may have facilitated the evolution of gut bacterial mutualists in insects.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Pallatom directly learns and models the joint distribution P(structure, seq) by focusing on P(all-atom), effectively addressing the interdependence between sequence and structure in protein generation. To achieve this, we propose a novel network architecture specifically designed for all-atom protein generation. Our model employs a dual-track framework that tokenizes proteins into token-level and atomic-level representations, integrating them through a multi-layer decoding process with traversing representations and recycling mechanism. We also introduce the atom14 representation method, which unifies the description of unknown side-chain coordinates, ensuring high fidelity between the generated all-atom conformation and its physical structure. Experimental results demonstrate that Pallatom excels in key metrics of protein design, including designability, diversity, and novelty, showing significant improvements across the board. Our model not only enhances the accuracy of protein generation but also exhibits excellent training efficiency, paving the way for future applications in larger and more complex systems.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Scatter pie plots are one type of commonly used data visualization for such data but present perceptual challenges that may lead to difficulties in interpretation.

We developed scatterbar, an open-source R package that extends ggplot2, to visualize proportional data across many spatially resolved coordinates using scatter stacked bar plots. We apply scatterbar to visualize deconvolved cell-type proportions from a spatial transcriptomics dataset of the mouse olfactory bulb to demonstrate how scatter stacked bar plots can enhance the distinguishability of proportional distributions compared to scatter pie plots.

However, it is unclear how recent WGDs may contribute to evolvability within recent polyploids. Hybridization accompanying some WGDs may combine divergent gene content among diploid species. Some theory and evidence suggest that polyploids have a greater accumulation and tolerance of gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation, but it is unclear to what extent either is true. To test how recent polyploidy may influence pangenomic variation, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated twelve complete, chromosome-scale genomes of Camelina sativa, an allohexaploid biofuel crop with three distinct subgenomes. Using pangenomic comparative analyses, we characterized gene presence-absence and genomic structural variation both within and between the subgenomes. We found over 75% of ortholog gene clusters are core in Camelina sativa and <10% of sequence space was affected by genomic structural rearrangements. In contrast, 19% of gene clusters were unique to one subgenome, and the majority of these were Camelina-specific (no ortholog in Arabidopsis). We identified an inversion that may contribute to vernalization requirements in winter-type Camelina, and an enrichment of Camelina-specific genes with enzymatic processes related to seed oil quality and Camelina's unique glucosinolate profile. Genes related to these traits exhibited little presence-absence variation. Our results reveal minimal pangenomic variation in this species, and instead show how hybridization accompanied by WGD may benefit polyploids by merging diverged gene content of different species.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

We conducted city-wide metagenomic surveillance of food-centre microbiomes in Singapore (16 centres, n=240 samples) to provide a detailed map of microbial (bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses) as well as non-microbial DNA abundances across two timepoints. Food-centre microbiomes were found to be enriched in food-related DNA signatures compared to other environments such as hospitals and offices, with specific food-microbe associations (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae and fish) and food DNA providing a partial explanation for the microbial profiles observed (44% of variation explained). Machine learning analysis identified a small set of microbial species (n=22) that serve as highly accurate (>80%) location-specific signatures for various food centres, some of which persist even after 3 years. Profiling of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens identified a surprising enrichment of ARGs in food centres relative to other non-healthcare environments (>2.5{xi}), and an order of magnitude enrichment of key pathogenic species (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp) even compared to hospital environments. These results highlight the contribution of diverse biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the unique microbiome profiles of different food-centre environments, and the potential for using metagenomic surveillance to understand the risk for infections and antibiotic resistance gene transmission.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

We introduce CauFinder, an advanced framework designed to accurately identify causal regulators of these transitions and further precisely steer such transitions by integrating causal disentanglement modelling with network control based solely on observed data. By leveraging do-calculus and optimizing information flow metrics, CauFinder can distinguish causal factors from spurious ones, ensuring precise control over desired state transitions. One significant advantage of CauFinder is its ability to identify those variables causally affecting the cell-state/phenotype transitions among all observed variables, both theoretically and computationally, leading to the identification of their master regulators when combined with network control. Consequently, by employing a counterfactual algorithm, CauFinder is able effectively to facilitate desirable state transitions or steer these transitional trajectories/paths by modulating these causal drivers. Beyond its theoretical advantages, CauFinder outperforms existing approaches computationally in both simulated and real-world settings. CauFinder is able to not only reveal natural biological transition processes such as (a) cell differentiation, (b) lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) transdifferentiation and (c) drug-sensitive to drug-resistant transitions but also identify the causal regulators of their reverse transition processes, such as (A) cell dedifferentiation, (B) LUSC to LUAD transdifferentiation and (C) drug-resistant to drug-sensitive transitions.

During development, as soon as myotubes are formed, myonuclei at muscle tips facing developing tendons display their own molecular program. In addition to molecular heterogeneity, a subset of tip myonuclei has a fibroblastic origin different to the classical somitic origin, highlighting a cellular heterogeneity of myonuclei in foetal myotubes. To gain insights on the functional relevance of myonucleus heterogeneity during limb development, we used 2D culture and co-culture systems to dissociate autonomous processes (occurring in 2D-cultures) from 3D-spatial environment of tissue development. We also assessed the role of mechanical parameters in myonucleus heterogeneity in paralysed limb muscles. The regionalisation of cellular heterogeneity was lost in 2D cell culture systems and paralyzed muscles. The molecular signature of MTJ myonuclei was also lost a dish and paralysed muscles indicating a requirement of spatial and mechanical input for MTJ formation. Tip genes that maintain their expression in a dish are involved in myofibrillogenesis and myotube attachments. The behaviour of regionalized markers in cultured myotubes and paralyzed muscles allows us to deduce whether the genes intervene in myogenesis, myotube attachment or MTJ formation.

Oral semaglutide was initiated postoperatively at 1.5 mg and scaled up in 2 weeks to 3 mg in treatment animals (SEM, n=8) for a total of 5 weeks, while control animals (CON, n=9) received no drug. All then underwent myocardial harvest with acquisition of perfusion and functional data using microsphere injection and pressure-volume loop catheterization. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed on the most ischemic myocardial segments for mechanistic elucidation. SEM animals exhibited improved left ventricular ejection fraction, both at rest and during rapid myocardial pacing (both p<0.03), accompanied by increased perfusion to the most ischemic myocardial region at rest and during rapid pacing (both p<0.03); reduced perivascular and interstitial fibrosis (both p <0.03); and apoptosis (p=0.008). These changes were associated with increased activation of the endothelial-protective AMPK pathway (p=0.005), coupled with downstream increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p=0.014). Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal the capacity of oral semaglutide to augment cardiac function in the chronically ischemic heart in a highly translational large animal model, likely through AMPK-mediated improvement in endothelial function and perfusion to the ischemic myocardium.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

In combination with phylogenomics analyses, hybrid zone studies may illuminate the role of ancient and contemporary gene flow in shaping variation of phylogenetic signals across the genome, but this avenue has not been explored yet. We combined phylogenomic and geographic cline analyses in a Pogoniulus tinkerbird clade to determine whether contemporary introgression through hybrid zones contributes to gene-tree heterogeneity across the species ranges. We found diverse phylogenetic signals across the genome with the most common topologies supporting monophyly among taxa connected by secondary contact zones. Remarkably, these systematic conflicts were also recovered when selecting only individuals from each taxons core range. Using analyses of derived allele sharing and ""recombination aware"" phylogenomics, we found that introgression shapes gene-tree heterogeneity, and the species tree most likely supports monophyletic red-fronted tinkerbirds, as recovered in previous reconstructions based on mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, by fitting geographic clines across two secondary contact zones, we found that introgression rates were lower in genomic regions supporting the putative species tree compared to those supporting the two taxa in contact as monophyletic. This demonstrates that introgression through narrow contact zones shapes gene-tree heterogeneity even in allopatric populations. Finally, we did not find evidence that mitochondria-interacting nuclear genes acted as barrier loci. Our results show that species can withstand important amounts of introgression while maintaining their phenotypic integrity and ecological separation, raising questions regarding the genomic architecture of adaptation and barriers to gene flow.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

H2 gas is produced in large quantities during bacterial fermentation and consumed as an energy source by bacteria and archaea. Disruption of H2 cycling is linked to gastrointestinal disorders, infections, and cancers, with H2 used as an indicator of gut dysfunction through breath tests. Despite this, the microorganisms, pathways, and enzymes mediating H2 production remain unresolved. Here we show that a previously uncharacterised enzyme, the group B [FeFe]-hydrogenase, drives most fermentative H2 production in the human gut. Analysis of stool, biopsy, and isolate (meta)genomes and (meta)transcriptomes show this hydrogenase is encoded by most gut bacteria and is highly expressed. Through analysis of 19 taxonomically diverse gut isolates, the group B [FeFe]-hydrogenase produces large amounts of H2 gas and supports fermentative growth of both Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Bacteroides particularly dominate H2 production. Biochemical and spectroscopic characterisation shows purified group B [FeFe]-hydrogenases are catalytically active and bind a di-iron active site. These hydrogenases are highly enriched in the guts of healthy individuals, but significantly depleted in favour of other fermentative hydrogenases in Crohns disease. Furthermore, we show that metabolically flexible respiratory bacteria are the most abundant H2 oxidizers in the gut, not sulfate reducers, methanogens, and acetogens as previously thought. This combination of enzymatic, cellular, and ecosystem-level analysis provides the first detailed understanding of H2 cycling in the human gut and reveals new links between microbiota function and gastrointestinal health.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

The genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha encodes single homologs for SERK and BIR, namely MpSERK and MpBIR.9 We here show that Mpserk disruptants display growth and developmental defects with no observable sexual or vegetative reproduction. Complementation analysis revealed a contribution of the conserved Y residue of MpSERK to growth. Proximity labelling-based interactomics identified MpBIR as a MpSERK interactor. Mpbir disruptants displayed defects in reproductive organ development. Patterns of development- and immunity-related gene expression in Mpserk and Mpbir were antagonistic, suggesting that MpBIR functions as a MpSERK repressor. The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 grew poorly on Mpbir, indicating a significant role of the MpSERK1MpBIR module in immunity.

Both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium responsible for TB, and HIV-1 target macrophages. Understanding how Mtb subverts these cells may facilitate the identification of new druggable targets. Here, we explored how TB can induce macrophages to form tunneling nanotubes (TNT), promoting HIV-1 spread. We found that TB triggers metabolic rewiring of macrophages, increasing their glycolytic ATP production. Using pharmacological inhibitors and glucose deprivation, we discovered that disrupting aerobic glycolysis significantly reduces HIV-1 exacerbation in these macrophages. Glycolysis is essential for tunneling nanotubes (TNT) formation, which facilitates viral transfer and cell-to-cell fusion and induces the expression of the sialoadhesin Siglec-1, enhancing both HIV-1 binding and TNT stabilization. Glycolysis did not exacerbate HIV-1 infection when TNT formation was pharmacologically prevented, indicating that higher metabolic activity is not sufficient per se to make macrophages more susceptible to HIV-1. Overall, these data might facilitate the development of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting glycolytic activity in TB-induced immunomodulatory macrophages to ultimately halt HIV-1 dissemination in co-infected patients.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

However, a mechanistic correlation between these risk factors has not been fully established. Using a historical birth cohort from Chile, we delve into the relationship between obesity and accelerated aging, spanning cellular to systemic levels. The cohort, comprising men and women in their late 20s, had their BMI recorded since birth, with 57% having obesity since childhood or adolescence. Our aim was to investigate if persistent obesity since childhood or adolescence leads to the display of molecular aging features in young adulthood. We also sought to determine whether cardiometabolic health issues accompanied this early aging phenotype. We used inferential statistics and data mining for analysis. Results show that persistent obesity since childhood or adolescence leads to epigenetic changes, telomere shortening, chronic inflammation, impaired nutrient sensing, mitochondrial stress, and diminished intercellular communication, resembling a compound network of interactions. This obesity-induced accelerated aging phenotype coincided with persistent decline of the cardiometabolic profile. Implications of our findings are significant and suggest that integrating molecular markers with clinical and epidemiological data could be valuable in identifying individuals at increased disease risk due to accelerated aging.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733714

To address this question, we optogenetically silenced the dHPC or the vHPC while simultaneously recording from the PFC of mice performing a SWM task. We found that whereas both HPC subregions were necessary during the encoding phase of the task, only the dHPC was necessary during the choice phase. Silencing of either subregion altered the spatial firing patterns of PFC neurons. However, only silencing of the vHPC affected their coding of spatial goals. These results thus reveal distinct contributions of the dorsal and ventral HPC poles to SWM and the coding of behaviorally-relevant spatial information by PFC neurons.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Unfortunately, for higher taxonomic ranks such as genus, establishing a generally accepted approach based on genome analysis is challenging. While core-genome phylogenies depict the evolutionary relationships among species, determining the correspondence between clades and genera may not be straightforward. For genotypic divergence, percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) and genome-wide average amino acid identity (AAI) are commonly used, but often do not provide a clear threshold for classification. In this work, we investigated the utility of global comparisons and data visualization in identifying clusters of species based on their overall gene content, and rationalized that such patterns can be integrated with phylogeny and other information such as phenotypes for improving taxonomy. As a proof of concept, we selected 177 representative genome sequences from the Mycoplasmatales-Entomoplasmatales clade within the class Mollicutes for a case study. We found that the clustering patterns corresponded to the current understanding of these organisms, namely the split into three above-genus groups: Hominis, Pneumoniae, and Spiroplasma-Entomoplasmataceae-Mycoides (SEM). However, at the genus level, several important issues were found. For example, recent taxonomic revisions that split the Hominis group into three genera and Entomoplasmataceae into five genera are problematic, as those newly described or emended genera lack clear differentiations in gene content from one another. Moreover, several cases of mis-classification were identified. These findings demonstrated the utility of this approach and the potential application for other bacteria.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Here we introduce machine learning-assisted genomics-and-imaging convergence (MAGIC), an autonomously operated platform that integrates automated live-cell imaging of micronucleated cells, machine learning in real-time, and single-cell genomics to investigate de novo CA formation at scale. Applying MAGIC to near-diploid, non-transformed cell lines, we track CA events over successive cell cycles, highlighting the common role of dicentric chromosomes as an initiating event. We determine the baseline CA rate, which approximately doubles in TP53-deficient cells, and show that chromosome losses arise more rapidly than gains. The targeted induction of DNA double-strand breaks along chromosomes triggers distinct CA processes, revealing stable isochromosomes, amplification and coordinated segregation of isoacentric segments in multiples of two, and complex CA outcomes, depending on the break location.

Understanding how environmental factors shape the genetic differentiation of natural populations and identifying the genetic basis of local adaptation will provide insights into how species may cope with environmental changes. The buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) has a wide natural distribution range and has been successfully domesticated to produce commercial colonies for greenhouse pollination. Previous population genetics studies on B. terrestris have mainly focused on populations in Europe; however, populations in Asia, representing the eastern side of its natural distribution, have been less thoroughly sampled. To fill this gap, we collected wild B. terrestris samples from Asia, as well as wild B. terrestris from Europe and samples from domesticated colonies. We conducted whole-genome resequencing for 77 collected B. terrestris workers and performed population genomics analysis. Our results indicated distinct genetic differentiation (FST=0.076) exists between buff-tailed bumblebees in Europe and Asia, with substantial morphological and physiological differences detected between them; B. terrestris in Asia likely represents a new subspecies. Demographic analysis suggested that the population size of buff-tailed bumblebees had increased during historic cold periods, confirming their cold-adapted characteristics. Selective sweep analysis identified 331 genes under selection in the genomes of Asian B. terrestris, likely involved in their adaptation to high ultraviolet radiation, low temperature, and low precipitation in their habitats.

In terms of reconstruction loss, our proposed AE models with orthogonal constraints have a slightly better reconstruction loss. All AE models achieve higher classification accuracy than the original features, demonstrating the usefulness of the embeddings extracted by the model. Particularly, we show that the proposed models have consistently high classification accuracy on both training and testing sets. In comparison, the recently proposed MOCSS model that imposes an orthogonality penalty in the post-processing step has lower classification accuracy that is on par with JIVE.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Although the genetic networks coordinating intra-embryonic mesodermal subtype specification are well-studied, the mechanisms driving ExEM diversification are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that embryoid body in vitro differentiation generates two distinct lineages of mesodermal cells matching YS and allantois respectively. Combining in vitro models with in vivo chimeric embryo analysis, we discover that Eomesodermin (Eomes) regulates the formation of a subset of YS-fated ExEM but is dispensable for allantois formation. Furthermore, simultaneous disruption of Eomes and T impedes the specification of any YS or allantois mesoderm, indicating compensatory roles for T during allantois formation when Eomes is disrupted. Our study highlights previously unrecognized functional and mechanistic diversity in ExEM diversification and endothelial development and introduces a tractable EB model to dissect the signaling pathways and transcriptional networks driving the formation of key extraembryonic tissues.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

In contrast, plants that use the derived and more efficient C4 photosynthetic pathway have a significant chloroplast compartment in both bundle sheath and mesophyll cells. Accordingly, the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from the ancestral C3 state requires an increase in the chloroplast compartment of the bundle sheath. Here we investigated the potential to increase chloroplast compartment size in rice bundle sheath cells by manipulating brassinosteroid signalling. Treatment with brassinazole, a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor, increased leaf chlorophyll content and increased the number but decreased the area of chloroplasts in bundle sheath cells. Constitutive overexpression of the BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1 (OsBZR1) transcription factor increased bundle sheath chloroplast area by up to 45% but plants became chlorotic. However, when OsBZR1 was placed under the control of a bundle sheath specific promoter, the negative effects on growth and viability were removed whilst chloroplast area still increased. In summary, we report a role for brassinosteroids in controlling chloroplast area and number in rice and conclude that cell-specific manipulation of brassinosteroid signalling can be used to manipulate the chloroplast compartment in rice bundle sheath cells.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Contractile forces generated by myosin motor proteins mediate these mechanical signal transduction processes through unclear protein structural mechanisms. Here, we show that myosin forces elicit structural changes in actin filaments (F-actin) that modulate binding by the mechanosensitive adhesion protein -catenin. Using correlative cryo-fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography, we identify F-actin featuring domains of nanoscale oscillating curvature at cytoskeleton-adhesion interfaces enriched in zyxin, a marker of actin-myosin generated traction forces. We next introduce a reconstitution system for visualizing F-actin in the presence of myosin forces with cryo-electron microscopy, which reveals morphologically similar superhelical F-actin spirals. In simulations, transient forces mimicking tugging and release of filaments by motors produce spirals, supporting a mechanistic link to myosin's ATPase mechanochemical cycle. Three-dimensional reconstruction of spirals uncovers extensive asymmetric remodeling of F-actin's helical lattice. This is recognized by -catenin, which cooperatively binds along individual strands, preferentially engaging interfaces featuring extended inter-subunit distances while simultaneously suppressing rotational deviations to regularize the lattice. Collectively, we find that myosin forces can deform F-actin, generating a conformational landscape that is detected and reciprocally modulated by a mechanosensitive protein, providing a direct structural glimpse at active force transduction through the cytoskeleton.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Therefore, they are not compatible with fixation and permeabilization, presence of serum, or cell co-culture because of their exchange with the medium. Here, we report a concept of lipid-directed covalent labeling of PM, which exploits transient binding to lipid membrane surface generating high local dye concentration, thus favoring covalent ligation to random proximal membrane proteins. This concept yielded a class of fluorescent probes for PM (MemGraft), where a cyanine dye (Cy3 and Cy5) bears at its two ends low-affinity membrane anchor and reactive group: an activated ester or a maleimide. We found that MemGraft probes with these reactive groups provide efficient PM labelling, in contrast to a series of control compounds, including commercial Cy3-based labels of amino and thiol groups, revealing the crucial role of the membrane anchor combined with high reactivity of activated ester and a maleimide groups. In contrast to conventional PM probes, based on non-covalent interactions, MemGraft labelling approach is compatible with cell fixation, permeabilization, trypsinization and presence of serum. The latter allows long-term cell tracking and video imaging of cell PM dynamics without signs of phototoxicity. The covalent strategy also enables staining and long-term tracking of co-cultured cells labelled in different colors without probes exchange. Moreover, combination of different ratios of MemGraft-Cy3 and MemGraft-Cy5 probes enabled long-term cell barcoding in at least 5 color codes, important for tracking and visualizing multiple cells populations.

This regulation is thought to define the spatio-temporal patterns of Ca2+ signals necessary for the appropriate activation of downstream effectors. The binding of both IP3 and Ca2+ are obligatory for IP3R channel opening, however, Ca2+ regulates IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. Mutational studies have revealed that Ca2+ binding to a high-affinity pocket formed by the ARM3 domain and linker domain promotes IP3R channel opening without altering the Ca2+ dependency for channel inactivation. These data suggest a distinct low-affinity Ca2+ binding site is responsible for the reduction in IP3R activity at higher [Ca2+]. We determined the consequences of mutating a cluster of acidic residues in the ARM2 and central linker domain reported to coordinate Ca2+ in cryo-EM structures of the IP3R type 3. This site is termed the CD Ca2+ binding site and is well-conserved in all IP3R sub-types. We show that the CD site Ca2+ binding mutants where the negatively charged glutamic acid residues are mutated to alanine exhibited enhanced sensitivity to IP3-generating agonists. Ca2+ binding mutants displayed spontaneous elemental Ca2+ events (Ca2+ puffs) and the number of IP3-induced Ca2+ puffs was significantly augmented in cells stably expressing Ca2+ binding site mutants. When measured with on-nucleus patch clamp, the inhibitory effect of high [Ca2+] on single channel-open probability (Po) was reduced in mutant channels and this effect was dependent on [ATP]. These results indicate that Ca2+ binding to the putative CD Ca2+ inhibitory site facilitates the reduction in IP3R channel activation when cytosolic [ATP] is reduced and suggest that at higher [ATP], additional Ca2+ binding motifs may contribute to the biphasic regulation of IP3-induced Ca2+ release.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Here, we identified that moderate low temperature (10C) condition triggers a strong RH elongation response involving several molecular components of the auxin pathway. Then, we have determined that auxin biosynthesis carried out by YUCCAs/TAA1, the auxin transport conducted by PIN2/PIN4 and AUX1/PGP4, and the auxin signaling controlled by TIR1/AFB2 coupled to four specific ARFs (ARF6/ARF8 and ARF7/ARF19), are all crucial for the RH response at moderate low temperature.

We establish interactions between DNAAF9 (human Shulin) and mammalian ODA subunits, IFT proteins and the ciliary small GTPase ARL3 using proteomics and in vitro reconstitutions. Mutagenesis combined with biochemical and structural studies reveal that DNAAF9 and Shulin preferentially bind the active Arl3-GTP state. GTP loaded Arl3 can access, bind and displace Shulin from the packaged ODA-Shulin complex. We propose that once the inhibited ODA complex enters growing cilia, Arl3-GTP displaces Shulin (DNAAF9) and sequesters it away from ODAs promoting the activation of their motility specifically inside cilia.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

HON activity varies rapidly across behavioral and metabolic states: active during periods of high arousal, and silent during quiescence. However, it is unknown whether HON activity tracks specific behaviors, or a general aspect of all behaviors, and whether this depends on metabolic state. After recording HON population dynamics in awake behaving mice, we performed a spectral analysis of HON encoding of spontaneous body movements and behaviors recorded via video-tracking. Multivariate analyses of distinct HON activity bandwidths revealed that movements were encoded at a higher frequency bandwidth than blood glucose, and imposing distinct metabolic states did not interfere with HON movement encoding. HON population activity tracked the total amount of body movement across multiple classified behaviors with a high degree of precision. At key projection targets, orexin/hypocretin peptide outputs correlated with self-initiated movement in a projection-specific manner, indicating functional heterogeneity in HON outputs. Finally, we found that body movement was not encoded to the same extent in other key neural clusters related to arousal or energy. Collectively, these data reveal a general principle behind HON activation in behaving animals, that is orthogonal to their reactions to metabolic shifts. This not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental roles of HONs in brain-body coordination, but also suggests novel non-invasive methods for monitoring HON population activity using video-tracked biometrics, which are pivotal for future investigations into how movement and energy demands are encoded by the brain.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Despite the significance of biofilms in natural and medical settings, in vitro models are very limited in replicating bacterial biofilm physiology during infection. To address this challenge, we have developed a new approach using a surface hydrogel to bring the in vitro studies of biofilms closer to in vivo situations. Our hydrogel substrate combines cross-linked agarose and gelatine. These biogel beads have several attractive properties, such as stability and autoclaving resistance, and can be rapidly colonised by bacterial pathogens when submerged in liquid culture. We tested this new substrate using three model bacterial pathogens: E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus. The biofilms formed on the agarose-gelatine beads exhibited more robust growth than those on glass beads for all three species. Moreover, biofilms formed on the agarose-gelatine beads exhibited increased virulence factor production, as indicated by their distinct proteomic signatures. In addition, these beads also acted as a reservoir for biofilm quorum sensing molecules, such as acyl-homoserine lactone. These unique features closely resemble clinical situations, suggesting that our new substrate provides a more accurate representation of biofilm-associated infections than current approaches, such as glass beads. The advantages of our new substrate over current methods are clear, making it an up-and-coming model for studying biofilms of bacterial pathogens and offering a practical and convenient solution to the research community.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

We believe that these results encourage scientific community to study PPL/PHR2 proteins which seems to play a special role in plants.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Despite their importance, comprehensive patterns within chromatin state sequences, which could provide insights into key biological functions, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce ChromBERT, a BERT-based model specifically designed to detect distinct patterns of chromatin state annotation data sequences. Notably, ChromBERT was pre-trained on promoter regions across a diverse range of epigenomes and subsequently fine-tuned using a dataset from multiple cell lines where RNA-seq data were available, highlighting the models ability to discern conserved chromatin state patterns within these regions. In addition to its predictive powers across tasks, evidenced by high AUC scores, ChromBERT provides further analysis through the incorporation of motif clustering using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). This method enhances the models ability to dissect chromatin state sequence motifs, typically involving transcription and enhancer sites. The introduction of motif clustering with DTW into ChromBERTs workflow is poised to facilitate the discovery of genomic regions linked to novel biological functions, deepening our understanding of chromatin state dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

In this context, a major transcriptional response of microglia is the upregulation of APOE, the strongest late-onset AD risk gene. Of its three isoforms, APOE2 is thought to be protective, while APOE4 increases AD risk. We hypothesised that the isoforms functionally alter microglia by shaping their transcriptomic and chromatin landscapes. We used RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility of human microglia isolated from a xenotransplantation model of AD. We identified widespread transcriptomic and epigenomic differences which are dependent on APOE genotype, and are corroborated across the profiling assays. Our results indicate that impaired microglial proliferation, migration and immune responses may contribute to the increased risk for late-onset AD in APOE4 carriers, while increased DNA-binding of the vitamin D receptor in APOE2 microglia may contribute to the isoforms protective role.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

The Gram-positive soil-dwelling bacterium, Bacillus subtilis produces a variety of secondary metabolites. Here, we investigated the regulatory relationship between the non-ribosomal peptide surfactin and the sactipeptide bacteriocin subtilosin A. We discovered that B. subtilis mutants lacking surfactin production exhibited higher production of subtilosin A compared to their parental wild-type strain. Additionally, spatial visualization of B. subtilis production of metabolites demonstrated that surfactin secreted by a wild-type colony could suppress subtilosin A production in an adjacent mutant colony lacking surfactin production. Reporter assays were performed using mutants in specific transcriptional regulators that confirmed the role of ResD as an activator of the subtilosin A encoding BGC, while removal or Rok and AbrB repressors increased expression of the BGC that was further enhanced by additional deletion of surfactin, suggesting that a so far unidentified regulator might mediate the influence of surfactin on production of subtilosin A. Our study reveals a regulatory influence of one secondary metabolite on another, highlighting that the function of secondary metabolites could be more complex than its influence on other organisms and interactions among secondary metabolites could also contribute to their ecological significance.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Here, we found that an understudied splice isoform of tau termed ""big tau"" is significantly more abundant in the brain regions less vulnerable to tau pathology compared to tau pathology-vulnerable regions. We used various cellular and animal models to demonstrate that big tau possesses multiple properties that can resist AD-related pathological changes.

We have uncovered a sex chromosome in California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) in which males/females have ZZ/ZO karyotypes respectively. We show that the octopus Z chromosome is an evolutionary outlier with respect to divergence and repetitive element content as compared to autosomes and that it is present in all cephalopods that we have examined including Nautilus, the outgroup to squids and octopuses. Our results suggest that the cephalopod Z chromosome system originated before the split of all extant cephalopod lineages, over 480 million years ago and has been conserved to the present, making it the among the oldest conserved animal sex chromosome systems known.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733714

Recent biogeographic work has provided global snapshots of NCLDV diversity and community composition across the worlds oceans, yet little information exists about the guiding  rules underpinning their community dynamics over time. We leveraged a five-year monthly metagenomic time-series to quantify the community composition of NCLDVs off the coast of Southern California and characterize these populations temporal dynamics. NCLDVs were dominated by Algavirales (Phycodnaviruses, 59%) and Imitervirales (Mimiviruses, 36%). We identified clusters of NCLDVs with distinct classes of seasonal and non-seasonal temporal dynamics. Overall, NCLDV population abundances were often highly dynamic with a strong seasonal signal. The Imitervirales group had highest relative abundance in the more oligotrophic late summer and fall, while Algavirales did so in winter. Generally, closely related strains had similar temporal dynamics, suggesting that evolutionary history is a key driver of the temporal niche of marine NCLDVs. However, a few closely-related strains had drastically different seasonal dynamics, suggesting that while phylogenetic proximity often indicates ecological similarity, occasionally phenology can shift rapidly, possibly due to host-switching. Finally, we identified distinct functional content and possible host interactions of two major NCLDV orders-including connections of Imitervirales with primary producers like the diatom Chaetoceros and widespread marine grazers like Paraphysomonas and Spirotrichea ciliates. Together, our results reveal key insights on season-specific effect of phylogenetically distinct giant virus communities on marine protist metabolism, biogeochemical fluxes and carbon cycling.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

Here we survey four commonly used plasmid backbones for occurrence of multimers in cloning (JM109) and wild-type (MG1655) strains. We find that multimers occur appreciably only in MG1655, with the fraction of plasmids existing as multimers increasing with both plasmid copy number and culture passaging.

METHODSWe expressed 74 PSEN2 variants, 21 of which had homologous PSEN1 variants with the same amino acid substitution, in HEK293 cells lacking PSN1/2. A{beta} production was compared to age at symptom onset (AAO) and between homologous PSEN1/2 variants.

We found a bilateral spatial distribution for all three representations, although there was a stronger tuning in the left hemisphere with a more widespread and temporally dynamic distribution than in the right hemisphere.

Using their surface bound T cell antigen receptors (TCRs), these cells, screen millions of antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or MHC-like molecules. In other protein families, the dynamics of protein-protein interactions have important implications for protein function. Case studies ofTCR:class I peptide-MHCs (pMHC-Is) structures have reported mixed results on whether the binding interfaces undergo conformational change during engagement and no robust statistical quantification has been done to generalise these results. It thus remains an open question if movement occurs in the binding interface that enables recognition and activation of T cells. In this work, we quantify the conformational changes in the TCR:pMHC-I binding interface by creating a dataset of 358 structures, comprising 25 TCRs, 20 MHC alleles, and 58 peptide structures in both unbound (apo) and bound (holo) conformations. In support of some case studies, we demonstrate that all complimentary determining region (CDR) loops move to a certain extent but only CDR3 and CDR3{beta} loops modify their shape when binding pMHC-Is. We also map out the contacts between TCRs and pMHC-Is, generating a novel fingerprint of TCRs on MHC molecules and show that the CDR3 tends to bind the N-terminus of the peptide and the CDR3{beta} tends to bind the C-terminus of the peptide. Finally, we show that the presented peptides can undergo conformational changes when engaged by TCRs, as has been reported in past literature, but novelly show these changes depend on how the peptides are anchored in the MHC binding groove.

Using water samples collected from hot springs in the Kunashir Island from the Kuril archipelago and from the Tsaishi and Nokalakevi districts in the Republic of Georgia we isolated several distinct phages infecting laboratory strains of Thermus thermophilus. Genomic sequence analysis of 11 phages revealed both close relatives of previously described Thermus phages isolated from geographically distant sites, as well as phages with very limited similarity to earlier isolates. Comparative analysis allowed us to predict several accessory phage genes whose products may be involved in host defense/interviral warfare, including a putative Type V CRISPR-cas system.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment when the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV2 became the dominant circulating strain, were included. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was examined prospectively. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. The analysis was adjusted for the propensity to get tested, age, sex, pandemic phase when the last prior COVID-19 episode occurred, and the number of prior vaccine doses.

ResultsAmong 47561 employees, COVID-19 occurred in 838 (1.8%) during the 16-week study period. In multivariable analysis, the 2023-2024 formula vaccinated state was associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 while the JN.1 lineage was the dominant circulating strain (hazard ratio [HR], .77; 95% confidence interval [C.I.], .62-.94; P = .01), yielding an estimated vaccine effectiveness of 23% (95% C.I., 6%-38%). Compared to 0 or 1 prior vaccine doses, risk of COVID-19 was incrementally higher with 2 prior doses (HR, 1.46; 95% C.I., 1.12-1.90; P < .005), 3 prior doses (HR, 1.95; 95% C.I., 1.51-2.52; P < .001), and more than 3 prior doses (HR, 2.51; 95% C.I., 1.91-3.31; P < .001).

ConclusionsThe 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine given to working-aged adults afforded a low level of protection against the JN.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, but a higher number of prior vaccine doses was associated with a higher risk of COVID-19.

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733715

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724018733715

Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

As the zebrafish embryo grows into a larva, to improve its heart function, the embryonic myocardial wall transforms into an intricate 3D architecture, composed of an outer compact layer enveloping an inner layer of multicellular trabecular ridges. How these tissue layers acquire their characteristic form suited for their function remains an open question. Here, we find that multiscale mechanochemical coupling and an emergent tissue-scale morphological transition steer functional maturation of the developing zebrafish heart. Single-celled trabecular seeds recruit outer compact layer cells to mature into clonally heterogenous multicellular ridges, thereby amplifying cardiac contractile forces. In response, remaining compact layer cells are stretched, which impedes their further recruitment, thereby constraining trabecular ridge density. Concomitantly, Notch-dependent actomyosin dampening triggers a sharp transition in myocardial tissue area, activating rapid organ growth that expands blood filling capacity. Thus, multiscale self-organizing interactions optimize heart size and contractile efficiency to support embryonic life.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

To date, the United States Centers for Disease Control reports that there have been 13 humans infected with H5N1 in 2024. The broader potential impact on human health remains unclear. In this study, we computationally model 1,804 protein complexes consisting of various H5 isolates from 1959 to 2024 against 11 HA1-neutralizing antibodies. This study shows a trend of weakening of the binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape of our medical defenses. We also found that based on the wide variety of host species and geographic locations in which H5N1 was observed to have been transmitted from birds to mammals, there is not a single central reservoir host species or location associated with H5N1's spread. These results indicate that the virus is well on its way to moving from epidemic to pandemic status in the near future. This study illustrates the value of high-performance computing to rapidly model protein-protein interactions and viral genomic sequence data at-scale for functional insights into medical preparedness.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1724018733715
