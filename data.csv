However, there remains concern regarding public health and an unmet need for therapeutic options. Herein, we report the discovery of S-892216, a second-generation SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor, to treat COVID-19. S-892216 is a reversible covalent 3CLpro inhibitor with highly potent antiviral activity and an EC50 value of 2.48 nM against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Structure-based design of a covalent modifier for compound 1 revealed that introducing a nitrile warhead increased 3CLpro inhibition activity by 180-fold. Subsequent optimization efforts yielded S-892216, which combined a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and high off-target selectivity. S-892216 exhibited antiviral activity against diverse SARS-CoV-2 variants, with no cross-resistance to major mutations reducing antiviral activities of nirmatrelvir and ensitrelvir. In SARS-CoV-2-infected mice, S-892216 inhibited viral replication in the lungs similar to ensitrelvir, although at a 30-fold lower dose.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Design Retrospective online survey. The survey was co-designed with Long COVID patients and carers. Setting Respondents were recruited from representative online panels in the U.S. and U.K. maintained by the data firm Dynata in early 2024. Participants After data cleaning, the final dataset comprised 1,816 respondents, 352 (19.4%) who reported Long COVID and 1,464 (80.6%) who did not. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was self-reported Long COVID, defined as experiencing symptoms related to a COVID-19 infection at least three months after the infection began. Participants were also asked to indicate whether they experienced no, mild or severe initial symptoms during each COVID-19 infection and to respond to nine questions that assessed different aspects of hypermobility: the Hakim and Grahame 5-part questionnaire (5PQ) and four additional co-produced questions. The 5PQ was used to identify individuals with generalized joint hypermobility (GJH). All nine questions were used to develop a measure of extreme hypermobility, based on the top 10th percentile of hypermobility among respondents in each of six groups sorted by age and gender. Results In separate binomial logistic regressions of the dataset controlling for sex assigned at birth, age, number of infections, and number of vaccine doses, both GJH (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.65) and extreme hypermobility (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.16) were found to be predictive of Long COVID. Hypermobility influences the odds of getting Long COVID through two pathways. First, both GJH and extreme hypermobility increase the risk that individuals with no or moderate initial symptoms from a COVID-19 infection experience Long COVID. Second, both GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant predictors of developing severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID-19 infection(s), which is independently associated with increased Long COVID risk. A mediation analysis confirmed that extreme hypermobility influences the odds of developing Long COVID in part by increasing the likelihood that individuals experience severe initial symptoms from (a) COVID infection(s). Conclusions Both GJH and extreme hypermobility are significant risk factors for Long COVID. People with extreme hypermobility are at particularly high risk of developing Long COVID after an initial COVID-19 infection. Further research is needed to replicate these findings with other datasets and clarify the pathophysiology that explains why people with hypermobility may be at greater risk of Long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1740953284526

Yet, a small fraction of the population reports a chronic debilitating condition after COVID-19 vaccination, often referred to as post-vaccination syndrome (PVS). To explore potential pathobiological features associated with PVS, we conducted a decentralized, cross-sectional study involving 42 PVS participants and 22 healthy controls enrolled in the Yale LISTEN study. Compared with controls, PVS participants exhibited differences in immune profiles, including reduced circulating memory and effector CD4 T cells (type 1 and type 2) and an increase in TNF+ CD8 T cells. PVS participants also had lower anti-spike antibody titers, primarily due to fewer vaccine doses. Serological evidence of recent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation was observed more frequently in PVS participants. Further, individuals with PVS exhibited elevated levels of circulating spike protein compared to healthy controls. These findings reveal potential immune differences in individuals with PVS that merit further investigation to better understand this condition and inform future research into diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.","NA","medrxiv",1740953284526

However, between 3 and 2 thousand years before present (BP) Celtic was widely spoken across most of Europe. While often associated with Bell Beaker-related populations, the spread of this prominent Indo-European linguistic cluster remains debated1--7. Previous genomic investigations have focused on its arrival to specific regions: Britain8, Iberia9 and Southwestern Germany10. Here, we utilize new genomic data from Bronze and Iron Age Europe to investigate the population history of historically Celtic-speaking regions, and test different linguistic theories on the origins and early spread of the Celtic languages. We identify a widespread demographic impact of the Central European Urnfield Culture. We find ancestry associated with its Knoviz subgroup in the Carpathian Basin to have formed between 4--3.2 kyr BP, and subsequently expanded across much of Western Europe between 3.2 and 2.8 kyr BP. This ancestry further persisted into the Hallstatt Culture of France, Germany and Austria, impacting Britain by 2.8 kyr BP and Iberia by 2.5 kyr BP. These findings support models of an Eastern Central rather than a Western European center of spread for a major component of all the attested Celtic languages. Our study demonstrates, yet again, the power of ancient population genomics in addressing long-standing debates in historical linguistics.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Asymptomatic colonization by S. aureus presents a significant risk for subsequent infection of the colonized infant and for patient-to-patient transmission. Transmission of more virulent S. aureus strains in the NICU could increase infection risk in this vulnerable population.

MethodsWe performed a three-year, unit-wide screening for S. aureus in the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) NICU, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 1,670 isolates from patient colonization surveillance, blood cultures from both NICU and non-NICU patients, and environmental surfaces. We used comparative genomic epidemiological approaches to investigate the transmission dynamics of S. aureus in the NICU setting.

FindingsOur analyses revealed 490 unique strains with multiple, highly related, clones among NICU S. aureus genomes. We identified sixty-nine transmission clusters, of which 87% (60/69) were methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), and 28% (19/69) included isolates from both colonizing sites and bacteremia. The largest invasive cluster persisted over 2 years, involved 30 infants, and caused 4 cases of bacteremia. Spatial and temporal epidemiological links were found in 88% of clusters, and suggest that shared spaces served as the predominant means of transmission in the NICU setting. NICU environmental surveillance revealed S. aureus on surfaces; 3 of these isolates were also identified in colonizing and invasive clusters, suggesting potential environmental reservoirs. Remarkably, transmission clusters with both colonizing and invasive isolates were associated with higher rates of transmission, suggesting that specific transmission clusters pose a significantly higher risk for invasive infections in the NICU.

InterpretationsGenomic temporal-spatial epidemiologic analyses revealed high levels of S. aureus transmission in the NICU with multiple transmission clusters that persisted over long periods of time. Our findings demonstrate a strong association amongst colonization, transmission, and the development of invasive infections, underscoring the importance of targeted measures to prevent S. aureus infections in the NICU setting.

Despite their significance, plasmids are underrepresented in genomic databases due to challenges in assembling them, caused by mosaicism and micro-diversity. Current plasmid assemblers rely on detecting circular paths in single-sample assembly graphs, but face limitations due to graph fragmentation and entanglement, and low coverage. We introduce PlasMAAG (Plasmid and organism Metagenomic binning using Assembly Alignment Graphs), a framework to recover plasmids and organisms from metagenomic samples that leverages an approach that we call ""assembly-alignment graphs"" alongside common binning features. On synthetic benchmark datasets, PlasMAAG reconstructed 50-121% more near-complete plasmids than competing methods and improved the Matthews Correlation Coefficient of geNomad contig classification by 28-106%. On hospital sewage samples, PlasMAAG outperformed all other methods, reconstructing 33% more plasmid sequences. PlasMAAG enables the study of organism-plasmid associations and intra-plasmid diversity across samples, offering state-of-the-art plasmid reconstruction with reduced computational costs.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

While the FDA considers 6-8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment. This raises questions about the evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices. Objective: To systematically compare the duration of placebo-controlled randomized trials of commonly prescribed antidepressants with real-world usage patterns. Design, Setting, and Participants: This descriptive review analyzed 52 eligible placebo-controlled randomized trials (n=10,116 participants) investigating the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, selected based on 2022 United States prescription data. Trials were sampled at 5-year intervals from 1978 through 2023. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the comparison between trial duration and real-world antidepressant use duration based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Secondary outcomes included methodological characteristics such as the use of standardized severity scales, withdrawal monitoring, taper protocols, and type of placebo used. Results: The median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years (260 weeks), while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6-12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n=46) had a duration of 12 weeks or less, and only 11.5% (n=6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, with none exceeding 52 weeks. Although 94.2% of antidepressant users are prescribed medication for longer than 60 days, the median trial duration was 56 days. Few trials monitored for withdrawal symptoms (3.8%) or included taper protocols (18.9%), and only 1.9% reported depression or anxiety outcomes during the post-treatment period. No trials used active placebos to mitigate unblinding. Conclusions and Relevance: A substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that monitor for withdrawal, sexual side effects, and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.","NA","medrxiv",1740953284526

Within the NRC (NLR Required for Cell Death) network, NLRs operate in complex sensor-helper configurations to confer immunity against a diverse array of pathogens, particularly in Asterids. While helper NLRs are typically conserved and evolve slowly, sensor NLRs tend to evolve more rapidly. However, the functional connections between slow and fast-evolving NLRs remain poorly understood, notably in important crop species. We conducted a comparative analysis of NLRs across 40 Solanales and 29 Asterales genomes to explore NRC network expansion and diversification within the less-studied Asterales order. Our findings reveal that the NRC network has expanded less in Asterales compared to Solanales. We functionally validated a minimal Asterales NRC network with 2 helpers and 9 sensors in common lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Through selection and diversification analysis and structural modeling of NRC helper and sensor subclades in the Lactuca genus, we found varying evolutionary diversification rates between NRC helpers and sensors. We found a correlation between sensor diversification rates and helper dependency, with sensors reliant on a phylogenetically conserved helpers experiencing limited diversification pressure. Our results highlight the lineage- and function-specific evolution of the NRC network, offering insights into the evolutionary pressures shaping plant immune receptor networks.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

While molecular data such as gene expression and methylation profiles offer comprehensive insights, obtaining this data is costly and is slow. Addressing this challenge, here we developed Path2Omics, a deep learning model that predicts gene expression and methylation from histopathology. Path2Omics was trained on 20,497 slides (a combination of 9,456 formalin fixed (FFPE) and 11,041 fresh frozen (FF)) from 8,007 patients across 23 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. When tested on FFPE slides, which are the most readily available in the clinical pathology practice from 15 TCGA cohorts, the integrated Path2Omics model outperformed its individual FF and FFPE trained components, achieving an average of nearly 5,000 genes whose expression is robustly inferred, approximately five times higher than our recently published DeepPT approach, the top extant prediction transcriptomics inference model. Externally evaluated on seven unseen independent patient cohorts, Path2Omics successfully robustly predicted the expression of about 4,400 genes, yielding a 30% increase over the performance of the FFPE model alone. Finally, we demonstrate that inferred gene expression and methylation using Path2Omics is as effective as the actual expression values for further predicting patient survival and treatment response. These results lay the basis for using Path2Omics to advance precision oncology from histopathology slides in a speedy and cost-effective manner, going forward.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

An emerging consensus is to reduce the potential immunogenicity of such therapies by instead using human protein domains. However, as we engineer these human-derived proteins, we create nonhuman peptides at the linkers or junctions between domains and at mutated residues within them, which still pose a risk of immunogenicity that has largely been left unaddressed. Here, we present a modular workflow to simultaneously optimize the functions of proteins and minimize their immunogenic risk using existing machine learning models that predict protein function and nonhuman peptide immunogenicity from their sequences. We first applied this workflow to existing transcriptional activation and bio-orthogonal RNA binding domains. Then we generated a set of small molecule-controllable transcription factors with human-derived zinc finger DNA-binding domains for targeting orthogonal non-genomic DNA sequences. Finally, we established a workflow for creating deimmunized zinc finger arrays to target arbitrary genomic DNA sequences and used it to upregulate expression of two therapeutically relevant genes, UTRN and SCN1A. Our future-proof, modular workflow offers a proof of principle for making cell and gene therapies safer and more efficacious through dual-objective protein optimization using state-of-the-art algorithms.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

However, little is known on the role of CD8 T cells in MS, partially due to the nearly ubiquitous use of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models that are mediated by CD4 T cells, with no CD8 T cell contribution. Importantly, MS and EAE differ in both their distribution of CNS lesions and their symptoms, indicating differences in CNS inflammation. MS lesions are more prevalent in the brain, while EAE lesions are more frequent in the spinal cord. Additionally, neurologic deficits in MS rarely parallel the paralysis typical for CD4 T cell-mediated EAE (CD4-EAE). In contrast, CD8-EAE models suggest that CD8 T cells preferentially cause brain inflammation, but little is known regarding how brain and spinal cord inflammation may differ, and how CD8 T cells may contribute to those differences. We have established an adoptive CD8-EAE mouse model characterized by brain-centered inflammation, severe ataxia, and weight loss. CNS inflammation in the brain and spinal cord differed in immune cell numbers, cellular composition, and inflammatory signatures. CD8-EAE could be suppressed by blocking IFN-g, and exacerbated by blocking PD-1, with concomitant changes in numbers of CNS-infiltrating monocytes. Most CD8 T cells in the CNS were CD11c+, suggesting that they are the pathogenic subset.

Using multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we analyzed transcript distribution and morphology simultaneously in young and aged mouse brains. Our approach revealed how mRNA spatial organization varies across microglial states. We identified distinct transcript localization patterns within microglial processes and uncovered morphological heterogeneity within transcriptomically defined populations. Notably, we found a subpopulation of disease-associated microglia with a ramified morphology (displaying numerous processes), challenging the conventional assumption between morphology and microglial states. Finally, we found that aging not only alters the distribution of compartmentalized mRNAs but also reshapes their colocalization networks, shifting microglial functions from synaptic maintenance and phagocytic processes in younger brains to migration and catabolic pathways in older brains. Our findings highlight the role of subcellular transcript organization in shaping microglial morphology and function, offering new avenues for studying and modulating microglial states in health, disease, and aging.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

These oscillations serve as a single-cell carrier signal, with frequency and amplitude controlled by GEO component levels and activity. We systematically characterize 169 ATPase/activator GEO pairs and engineer composite GEOs with multiple competing activators to develop a comprehensive platform for waveform programming. Using these principles, we design circuits that modulate GEO frequency in response to cellular activity and decode their responses using a calibrated machine-learning model to demonstrate sensitive, real-time FM streaming of transcription and proteasomal degradation dynamics in single cells. GEOs establish a dynamically controllable biochemical carrier signal, unlocking noise-resistant FM data-encoding paradigms that open new avenues for dynamic single-cell analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

However, our study reveals a systematic failure of both technologies to sequence and assemble specific exons of Drosophila melanogaster genes, indicating an overlooked limitation. Namely, multiple Y-linked exons are nearly or completely absent from raw reads produced by deep sequencing with state-of-the-art Nanopore (10.4 flow cells, 200x coverage) and PacBio (HiFi 50x). The same exons are accurately assembled using Illumina 65x coverage. We found that these missing exons are consistently located near simple satellite sequences, where sequencing fails at multiple levels: read initiation (very few reads start within satellite regions), read elongation (satellite-containing reads are shorter on average), and base-calling (quality scores drop as sequencing enters a satellite sequence). These findings challenge the assumption that long-read technologies is unbiased and reveal a critical barrier to assembling sequences near repetitive regions. As large-scale sequencing projects move towards telomere-to-telomere assemblies in a wide range of organisms, recognizing and addressing these biases will be important to achieving truly complete and accurate genomes. Additionally, the underrepresented Y-linked exons provides a valuable benchmark for refining those sequencing technologies while improving the assembly of the highly heterochromatic and often neglected Drosophila Y chromosome.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

However, gaps remain in our understanding of the ecological factors that shape the bat virome and influence the diversity, circulation and persistence of viral infections. Flying foxes (Pteropodidae) are representative of the chiropteran fauna in Australia, holding significant ecological, cultural, and social importance. However, some species have also been linked to the circulation of mammalian pathogens such as Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. Here, we characterised the virome of the Christmas Island flying fox (Pteropus melanotus natalis), an endemic and endangered species only found on the remote Australian territory of Christmas Island. Through metatranscriptomic sequencing of 46 samples, including faeces, blood, urine and tissue lesions, we found that these bats exhibit limited RNA virus diversity dominated by dietary viruses. The paucity of RNA viruses likely results from their small population size (between 1500 and 2600 individuals) and the virtual geographic isolation from other bat and mammalian species, except for pests and humans. However, we identified a novel alphacoronavirus in urine, related to viruses circulating in microbats in mainland Australia, and a picorna-like virus related to picornaviruses found in invertebrates. Although this novel picorna-like virus may be of a dietary origin, these flying foxes predominantly eat nectar, pollen and fruit, and viral RNA was also present in blood, urine and wing lesion samples, such that a broader tropism cannot be excluded. Overall, these data reveal how ecological factors have a profound impact on RNA virome diversity, highlighting risks to bat conservation, and showing that bats are not always persistent reservoirs for zoonotic viruses.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Unbiased analyses of IDRome-spanning grammars reveals that specialized IDR grammar features direct biological processes, cellular localization preferences, and molecular functions. IDRs with exceptional grammars, defined as sequences with high-scoring non-random features, are harbored in proteins and complexes that enable spatial and temporal sorting of biochemical activities. Protein complexes within the nucleus recruit specific factors through top-scoring IDRs. These IDRs are frequently disrupted via cancer-associated mutations and fusion oncoproteins. Overall, GIN enables the decoding of sequence-function relationships of IDRs and can be deployed in IDR-specific and IDRome-wide analyses.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Recent progress in inference has made ARG-based approaches feasible across of range of applications, and many new methods using inferred ARGs as input have appeared. This progress on the long-standing problem of ARG inference has proceeded in two distinct directions. First, the Bayesian inference of ARGs under the Sequentially Markov Coalescent (SMC), is now practical for tens-to-hundreds of samples. Second, approximate models and heuristics can now scale to sample sizes two to three orders of magnitude larger. Although these heuristic methods are reasonably accurate under many metrics, one significant drawback is that the ARGs they estimate do not have the topological properties required to compute a likelihood under models such as the SMC under present-day formulations. In particular, heuristic inference methods typically do not estimate precise details about recombination events, which are currently required to compute a likelihood. In this paper we present a backwards-time formulation of the SMC and derive a straightforward definition of the likelihood of a general class of ARG under this model. We show that this formulation does not require precise details of recombination events to be estimated, and is robust to the presence of polytomies. We discuss the possibilities for inference that this opens.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Many defense systems were unrecognizable based on sequence or predicted structure, so could only be identified via functional assays. In mechanistic studies, we show that some defense systems encode nucleases that only degrade covalently modified phage DNA, but which accommodate diverse chemical modifications. We also identify outer membrane proteins that prevent phage adsorption and a set of previously unknown defense systems with diverse antiphage profiles and modalities.

Examining the zoonotic emergence of Ebola virus, Marburg virus, influenza A virus, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, we find no evidence of a change in the intensity of natural selection immediately prior to a host switch, compared with typical selection within reservoir hosts. We conclude that extensive pre-zoonotic adaptation is not necessary for human-to-human transmission of zoonotic viruses. In contrast, the reemergence of H1N1 influenza A virus in 1977 showed a change in selection, consistent with the hypothesis of passage in a laboratory setting prior to its reintroduction into the human population, purportedly during a vaccine trial. Holistic phylogenetic analysis of selection regimes can be used to detect evolutionary signals of host switching or laboratory passage, providing insight into the circumstances of past and future viral emergence.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

By investigating the colonisation of Arabidopsis thaliana by the highly polyphagous peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae), we identified cell wall-derived DAMPs, specifically oligogalacturonides (OGs), as key in inducing DTI against aphids. The OG-responsive immune components BAK1/BKK1, CPK5/CPK6, GRP3, and EDS1 collectively contribute to DTI limiting aphid colonisation. We found that aphids limit OG production during feeding. Additionally, the salivary chemosensory protein (CSP) effector Mp10/CSP4, which is known to be delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells early in aphid attack, inhibits OG-induced DTI. While Mp10 suppresses OG-induced DTI, it also interacts with EDS1-mediated defences, enhancing aphid fecundity in the absence of EDS1 but restoring OG responsiveness under attack, revealing its broader role in immune modulation and effector-driven host adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Here, we used synaptic partner matching in the Drosophila olfactory circuit to address this question. By systematically altering the combination of differentially expressed CSPs in a single olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) type, which senses a male pheromone that inhibits male-male courtship, we switched its connection from its endogenous postsynaptic projection neuron (PN) type nearly completely to a new PN type that promotes courtship. To achieve this switch, we deduced a combinatorial code including CSPs that mediate both attractive and repulsive interactions between synaptic partners. The anatomical switch changed the odor response of the new PN partner and markedly increased male-male courtship. We generalized three manipulation strategies from this rewiring to successfully rewire a second ORN type to multiple distinct PN types. This work demonstrates that manipulating a small set of CSPs is sufficient to respecify synaptic connections, paving ways to explore how neural systems evolve through changes of circuit connectivity.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Functional CD8+ T-cell responses against HIV peptides Env, Gag, Nef, and Pol were maintained over three years after treatment initiation. The proliferative capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells at 24 weeks was associated with the decline of total and defective HIV DNA reservoir, suggesting that HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells may at least partially drive the decline of the viral reservoir.

We explore this premise in All of Us Research Program participants with pathogenic variation causal for three Mendelian conditions: autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), Marfan syndrome, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

MethodsWe identified All of Us Research Program participants with putatively pathogenic variation in NF1, FBN1, PKD1, and PKD2. Concept terms were extracted from electronic health records to assess participant diagnosis and phenotype. Variant annotation and participant surveys were evaluated to identify biological and social factors differentiating diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals.

ResultsLarge proportions of individuals with pathogenic variation in NF1, FBN1, or PKD1/PKD2 lack the associated diagnosis of NF1 (47%), Marfan syndrome (58%), or ADPKD (51%), respectively. Pathogenic variants in diagnosed individuals have greater inferred deleteriousness for NF1 and ADPKD, and undiagnosed individuals had less severe phenotypes compared to diagnosed individuals for all three conditions.

Human and mouse esophageal MCs displayed the highest level of Crlf2 (TSLPR) compared to other immune cells. Crlf2-/- mice were nearly-completely protected from EoE, and TSLP neutralization resulted in decreased basal cell proliferation, eosinophilia, lamina propria thickening and vascularization. Induction of experimental EoE in Il33-/- mice resulted in reduced eosinophilia but no alterations in tissue remodeling were observed compared to WT mice. RNA sequencing revealed that TSLP regulates the expression of key genes associated with human EoE (e.g. eotaxins, Il19, Klk5, Flg, Il36rn, Il1r2) and suggest a role for TSLP in regulating IL-1 signaling, barrier integrity and epithelial cell differentiation. Experimental EoE was characterized by a MC-associated gene signature and elevated MCs. Activation of MCs with TSLP resulted in secretion of IL-13. Conclusion: TSLP and IL-33 have non-redundant functions in experimental EoE. This study highlights TSLP as an upstream regulator of IL-13 and a potential therapeutic target for EoE.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Many orthoceratoids contain cameral deposits, which are enigmatic calcareous structures within their chambered shell that presumably balanced their straight conchs in a horizontal position. Since the mid-19th century, palaeontologists have attempted to understand the cameral deposit formation process. The various hypotheses include growth from cameral fluids, precipitation by a cameral mantle or even their dismissal as post-mortem structures. All of these previous interpretations have in common that they are complicated with contradictory evidence. Here, we present evidence from well-preserved Trematoceras elegans specimens from the Late Triassic St. Cassian Formation (Dolomites, northern Italy). We studied the specimens by using optical and electron beam microanalysis techniques and argue that the cameral deposits consist of primary aragonite and calcite fabrics. A fibrous microstructure, which is bilaterally symmetrically arranged with irregularities, is documented. Thin organic sheets originally delimited radial growth sectors. Based on these observations, we propose a new growth model that explicitly involves the cameral sheets. These sheets acted as an extension of the pellicle and held a thin film of supersaturated liquid in the otherwise emptied chambers by the cameral sheets via the capillary effect. Ions were supplied through the siphuncle, such as in living Nautilus, and enabled the precipitation of aragonite and calcite fabrics. This model goes beyond previous interpretations, resolves contradictory observations and has functional implications, suggesting that cameral sheets and deposits were an adaptation to increased growth rates.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

How new KZFPs emerge in response to ERV invasions is currently unknown. Using a combination of long-read sequencing technologies and genome assembly, we present a first detailed comparative analysis of young KZFP gene clusters in the mouse lineage, which has undergone recent KZFP gene expansion and ERV infiltration. Detailed annotation of KZFP genes in a cluster on Mus musculus Chromosome 4 revealed parallel expansion and diversification of this locus in different mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ and CAST/EiJ) and species (Mus spretus and Mus pahari). Our data supports a model by which new ERV integrations within young KZFP gene clusters likely promoted recombination events leading to the emergence of new KZFPs that repress them. At the same time, ERVs also increased their numbers by duplication instead of retrotransposition alone, unraveling a new mechanism for ERV enrichment at these loci.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Here, we present DELi, an open-source DEL informatics platform designed for library design, NGS decoding and calling, and enrichment analysis. To showcase its capabilities, we used DELi to design an in-house custom library (UNC-DEL006), a benzimidazole-based DEL, and performed proof-of-concept selection experiments against Bromodomain-containing Protein 4 (BRD4). The DELi decoding and analysis modules identified top-performing compounds, leading to the off-DNA synthesis of UNC 002-080, which was confirmed as a nanomolar BRD4 binder via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). In contrast, a chemically similar compound not prioritized by DELi, UNC 002-083, showed no measurable binding. These results demonstrate DELi as an effective tool for DEL design and analysis.

Early botanical and comparative morphological research and recent genetic research supported a polyphyletic origin. A monophyletic origin was proposed after the discovery that a single genetic locus controls the presence of hull-less grains in all domesticated barley. Interpreting the origin of domesticated barley is further complicated by the archaeological record showing that the first domesticates had two rows of grain on the inflorescence, as does its wild progenitor. However, these two-rowed types effectively disappeared from the record for thousands of years, and they were replaced by derived six-rowed types that dominated barleys cultivation history and only reappeared in the record around one thousand years ago. Here, we used two independent datasets with large sample sizes and genome-wide genetic markers to re-evaluate barley cultivation history. We unequivocally demonstrate that modern domesticated barley has a monophyletic origin. Phylogenetic reconstruction and examination of current archaeological records suggests that the west Fertile Crescent was most likely where barley was first domesticated. Modern two-rowed types were likely derived from six-rowed domesticated types not earlier than 3,500 years ago in modern Turkiye and Iran. We conclude that the two distinct non-brittle rachis haplotypes, coinciding with distinct row types in cultivated barley, are likely the results of two chronological events along the same evolutionary line. Our results provide a reconcilable framework for explaining genetic and phytogeographic patterns and pave the way for a consensus on the origin of barley domestication.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

We previously showed that morning (AM) exposure to hyperinsulinemia primes the liver for enhanced hepatic glucose uptake and glycogen storage in the afternoon (PM), with no significant effect on PM non-hepatic glucose uptake. Given that meals often trigger both insulin and glucagon secretion, we aimed to determine if AM hyperglucagonemia alters the priming effect of AM hyperinsulinemia on PM hepatic glucose metabolism. To test this, dogs were exposed to a 4h AM hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, with insulin delivered in a pattern mimicking the insulin profile observed earlier during a 4h AM duodenal glucose infusion. This period of hyperinsulinemia was paired with either basal (Prime, n=8) or elevated (Prime + elevated GGN, n=8) glucagon, maintaining a consistent insulin-to-glucagon molar ratio throughout the AM clamp. After a 1.5h rest period, the dogs underwent a 2.5h PM hyperinsulinemic-hyperglycemic clamp, during which glucose, insulin, and glucagon levels, along with the artery-to-portal vein glucose gradient, were carefully controlled to replicate postprandial conditions. During the PM clamp, the mean net hepatic glucose uptake (NHGU) in the Prime + elevated GGN group was only 59% of that in the Prime group (3.6{+/-}0.4 vs. 6.1{+/-}0.6 mg/kg/min, P<0.0027, respectively). Additionally, PM direct glycogen synthesis was two-fold greater in the Prime group compared to the Prime + elevated GGN group (3.2{+/-}0.7 vs. 1.5{+/-}0.2 mg/kg/min, P<0.0014, respectively). The observed difference in PM NHGU between the groups was not due to enhanced PM hepatic glucose uptake (HGU), which was similar in both groups (5.7{+/-}0.5 mg/kg/min in the Prime group vs. 5.2{+/-}0.3 mg/kg/min in the Prime + elevated GGN group), but rather a prolonged effect of AM hyperglucagonemia on PM hepatic glucose production (HGP) (-0.3{+/-}0.3 mg/kg/min in the Prime group vs. 1.7{+/-}0.4 mg/kg/min in the Prime + elevated GGN group, P<0.0072). This increase in PM HGP in the Prime + elevated GGN group was not driven by differences in PM gluconeogenic flux but by futile glucose cycling between glucose and glucose-6-phosphate, as well as hepatic glycogen storage and breakdown. In summary, these findings suggest that morning exposure to elevated glucagon shifts the insulin-driven priming effect on afternoon hepatic glucose metabolism by promoting sustained glucose cycling at the expense of glycogen synthesis and glycolysis, leading to persistent HGP despite identical PM insulin, glucose, and glucagon levels.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

The production of functional eggs in sufficient numbers for a female lifespan requires dynamic and precisely coordinated cellular and developmental programs in early oogenesis. However, our understanding of their underlying regulatory mechanisms is critically lacking. Here, we aimed to identify overlooked essential regulators of early oogenesis in zebrafish. First, we present the establishment of a long-term ovary culture system which enables physiological oocyte development from oogonia to primordial follicles in cultured ovaries, providing an invaluable ex-vivo platform for rapid investigation. Next, we utilized this system for robust functional screening of candidates from stage-specific oocyte transcriptomic data. We identified mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin as novel regulators of oocyte polarity. By using a combination of genetics, pharmacological manipulations ex-vivo, and rescue experiments, we established an essential mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway that orchestrates centrosome regulation and microtubule organization to facilitate oocyte polarity. Microtubules control the localization and condensation of the essential polarity regulator Bucky ball (Buc). Loss of mTOR or Stat3 functions, as well as overactivation of Stathmin (a microtubule destabilizing protein) resulted in aberrant centrosome regulation and destabilization of microtubules, leading to dispersed mis-localized Buc condensates and loss of polarity. We show that mTOR acts upstream of Stat3 in oocytes, and that inhibition of Stathmin in stat3-/- or mTOR deficient ovaries rescued both cytoskeletal and polarity defects. We propose a novel mTOR-Stat3-Stathmin pathway which through cytoskeletal regulation, provides oocytes with polarization competence, a step likely widely conserved in biology. mTOR, Stat3, and Stathmin are known for their roles in cellular growth and cancer. Our work reveals their novel unpredicted functions in cell polarity during animal post-embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Proteomic studies comparing GRP-activated and -inactivated strains derived from diverse Pseudomonas species showed that the pathway regulates a large and variable suite of factors implicated in defense against both bacterial and phage threats. Focusing on P. protegens, we identify profound phenotypic consequences of these factors against multiple forms of bacterial antagonism and several phage.

So far, successful development of efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) has been plagued by undesirable toxicities and inconsequential in vivo efficacy. TAXIS Pharmaceuticals Inc. has discovered an effective anti-pseudomonal therapy involving a novel indole carboxamide class of EPI, TXA11114, with a fluorine substituted diamine sidechain, as an adjunctive to levofloxacin. TXA11114 has demonstrated excellent potentiation of levofloxacin MIC by [&ge;] 8-fold in 90% of Walter-Reed and CDC multi-drug resistant (MDR) isolates. Biophysical and genetic studies with TXA11114 support efflux inhibition while ruling out membrane disruption as a mechanism of action. TXA11114 enhanced the levofloxacin killing and diminished the frequency of resistance emergence to levofloxacin to undetectable levels. Moreover, in murine thigh and lung P. aeruginosa infection models, the TXA11114-levofloxacin combination showed pronounced killing compared to levofloxacin alone, achieving a validated in vivo efficacy milestone that previous EPIs could not. Most importantly, TXA11114 exhibits a safe toxicology profile when screened for cytotoxicity, hERG channel inhibition, in vitro nephrotoxicity, and acute toxicity. Further, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of TXA11114 have a complementary profile with that of levofloxacin in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of infected mice, maximizing pharmacodynamic (PD) benefits. Overall, studies on the TXA11114-levofloxacin combination highlight its potential as an anti-pseudomonal agent for combating multidrug-resistant infections.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

EvoFlow-RNA bridges the gap between RNA sequence representation and design. It outperforms leading RNA models on six BEACON tasks critical to understanding RNA function, such as secondary structure prediction. For unconditional generation, it synthesizes diverse RNA sequences with native-like biophysical properties. Furthermore, EvoFlow-RNA can optimize aptamer sequences while preserving binding recognition sites. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoFlow-RNA in RNA modeling, highlighting the capability and potential of masked discrete diffusion for both recapitulating and enhancing existing RNAs.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Accordingly, helicases are instrumental in maintaining genomic integrity and ensuring genetic diversity. Srs2 is a multi-functional DNA helicase that dismantles Rad51 nucleofilaments and regulates DNA strand invasion to prevent excessive or inappropriate homologous recombination in yeast. Consistently, the deletion of Srs2 has significant consequences for the maintenance of genome integrity in mitotic cells. In contrast, its role in meiotic recombination remains less clear. We present here substantial evidence that SRS2 plays an important role in meiotic recombination in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis srs2 mutants exhibit moderate defects in DNA damage-induced RAD51 focus formation, but SRS2 is dispensable for DNA repair and RAD51-dependent recombination in somatic cells. Meiotic progression and fertility appear unaffected in srs2 plants but strikingly, the absence of SRS2 leads to increased genetic interference accompanied by increased numbers of Class I COs and a reduction in MUS81-dependent Class II COs. SRS2 thus has both anti- and pro-CO roles during meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana - acting as an anti-CO factor by influencing the stability and/or the dissociation of early recombination intermediates, while playing a pro-CO role by promoting MUS81-mediated resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

The inclina-tion of individuals born with low birth weight towards palatable foods indicates a possible modification in the hedonic aspect of their eating behavior. However, our understanding of the ontogenesis of structural organization and function within the brain's reward circuits remains limited. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the preferences for palatable food, molec-ular signatures of reward circuits, and functional properties of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a rat model of perinatal protein restriction (LP). Starting from weaning, continuing into adolescence and adulthood, a longitudinal analysis was conducted on rats born to mothers with protein-restricted diets during gestation and lactation (LP pups), comparing them to pups born from control dams (CD pups). The LP group exhibited an increased preference for palatable food at day 25 after birth (P25), followed by a decreased preference during adolescence (P50), and no significant difference in palatable food preference at P95 (young adult) compared to CD rats. Molecular and electrophysiological assessments of medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the NAc revealed a reorganization of reward circuits during crucial developmental periods, potentially influencing the attractiveness of palatable food for the LP group. This study represents the first exploration of how preferences for palatable food evolve throughout an indi-vidual's lifespan and how these observations correlate with the remodeling of reward circuits. By shedding light on the molecular and functional aspects of reward circuits, we contribute to a better understanding of the link between perinatal nutrition, behav-ioral preferences, and the underlying neural mechanisms.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

INs expressing the neuropeptide vasoactive-intestinal peptide (VIP) have attracted attention recently following the discovery that they predominantly function by inhibiting dendritic-targeting somatostatin (SST) expressing INs, thereby disinhibiting PCs. This VIP-SST disinhibitory circuit motif is observed throughout the neocortex from mice to humans, and serves as a key mechanism for top-down (feedback) and context-dependent information processing. Thus, VIP IN-mediated disinhibition has been found to play an important role in sensory processing, control of executive functions, attention, sensorimotor integration and other cortico-cortical and thalamocortical feedback interactions. Furthermore, VIP INs have been implicated in mediating the effects of reinforcement signals, both reward and aversive, via their responsiveness to neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (ACh), and in facilitating synaptic plasticity and learning. While it is evident from transcriptomic analyses that VIP INs are a molecularly heterogeneous group, the physiological significance of this diversity is unclear at present. Here, we have characterized the functional diversity of VIP INs in the primary somatosensory cortex by leveraging intersectional genetic approaches to study distinct VIP IN subtypes. We found that VIP INs can be divided into four different populations: a group that expresses the Ca2+-binding protein calretinin (CR), two distinct groups that express the neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK), and a group that does not express either CR or CCK (non-CCK non-CR; or nCCK nCR). VIP neurons in each group exhibit different laminar distributions, axonal and dendritic arbors, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, and efferent connectivity, VIP/CR INs target almost exclusively SST INs, VIP/nCCK nCR INs also mainly target SST INs but also have connections to parvalbumin (PV) expressing INs. These two groups have essentially no connectivity to pyramidal cells (PCs). On the other hand, the two types of VIP/CCK INs target PCs, but differ in the degree to which synaptic release from each type is modulated by endocannabinoids. We also found that long-range inputs differentially recruit distinct VIP IN groups. Intriguingly, we find that distinct VIP IN populations target distinct SST INs subtypes in turn, indicating the presence of specialized VIP-SST disinhibitory subcircuits. Activation of distinct VIP IN subpopulations in vivo results in differential effects on the cortical network, thus providing evidence for modularity in VIP IN-mediated actions during cortical information processing.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Most remain uncultured, limiting investigation of their physiology and cell biology. MArine STramenopiles (MASTs) are heterotrophic protists that, although related to well-characterised photosynthetic diatoms and parasitic oomycetes, are poorly studied. The Nanomonadea (MAST-3) species Incisomonas marina has been maintained in co-culture with a bacterial consortium, offering opportunities to investigate the metabolic attributes and nutritional dependencies of the community. Employing a metagenomics approach, the 68 Mbp haploid genome of I. marina was retrieved to an estimated completeness of 93%, representing the most complete MAST genome so far. We also characterised the diversity of, and assembled genomes for, 23 co-cultured bacteria. Auxotrophy of I. marina for B vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B7 and B12), but not vitamins C, B3, B5 and B9 was predicted. Several bacteria also lacked complete B-vitamin biosynthesis pathways, suggesting that vitamins and/or their precursors are exchanged in the consortium. Moreover, I. marina lacked the ability to synthesise half the protein amino acids, although genes encoding the complete urea cycle were identified, like diatoms; this may play a role in recycling organic nitrogen compounds. Unexpectedly, we also identified the gene DSYB for dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) biosynthesis. Biosynthesis of this important stress-protectant and bacterial chemoattractant is typically found in photosynthetic eukaryotes and has not before been identified in heterotrophic stramenopiles.

Hand function can be disrupted by injury to the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves leading to weakness and impaired coordination. Functional MRI (fMRI) can map motor-related neural activity and potentially characterize the mechanisms underlying hand weakness and diminished coordination. Although brain motor control has been extensively studied, spinal cord mechanisms remain less explored. Here we use simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI to map neural activity related to hand strength and dexterity across the central nervous system using force matching and finger tapping tasks. This study pioneers the use of simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI to comprehensively map hand function, offering novel insights into coordinated motor processing across the central nervous system. METHODS: We performed simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI in 28 right-handed healthy volunteers (age: 40.0 {+/-} 13.8 years, 14 females, 14 males) using a 3T GE SIGNA Premier scanner equipped with a 21-channel head-neck coil. Participants performed a force-matching task at 10%, 20%, and 30% of maximum voluntary contraction using a hand dynamometer. For the finger tapping task, participants completed button-presses at 1 Hz with a 5-button response pad for three task levels: single-digit response with the second digit only (low), single-digit response with all digits in a sequential order (medium), single-digit response with all digits in a random order (high). Visual cues and feedback were provided during the tasks. Brain and spinal cord images were processed separately using FSL and the Spinal Cord Toolbox, with motion correction, physiological noise filtering, and spatial normalization to standard templates. Subject level activity maps were generated and entered into group level analyses to explore both activations and deactivations. For the brain, we used a mixed effect design with a voxelwise threshold of Z score > 3.10 and cluster threshold of p < 0.05. For the spinal cord, we used a fixed effect design with a voxelwise threshold of Z score > 1.64 and cluster threshold of p < 0.05. Region of interest (ROI) analyses were conducted to examine localized changes in activation across task levels RESULTS: Both tasks elicited activation in motor and sensory regions of the brain and spinal cord, with graded responses in the left primary motor (M1), left primary sensory (S1) cortex, and right spinal cord gray matter across task levels. Deactivation of the right M1 and S1 was also present for both tasks. Deactivation of the left spinal cord gray matter was present in the high task level of the force matching task. The ROI analysis findings complemented the group level activity maps. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a detailed map of brain-spinal cord interactions in hand function, revealing graded neural activation and inhibition patterns across motor and sensory regions. Interhemispheric inhibition, reflected in right M1 deactivation, likely restricts extraneous motor output during unilateral tasks. For force matching, the deactivation of the left ventral and dorsal horns of the spinal cord, provides the first evidence that the inhibition of motor areas during a unilateral motor task extends to the spinal cord. Whether this inhibition results from direct descending modulation from the brain or interneuronal inhibition in the cord remains to be interrogated. These findings expand our understanding of central motor control mechanisms and could inform rehabilitation strategies for individuals with motor impairments. CONCLUSIONS: Our simultaneous brain-spinal cord fMRI approach provides novel insights into the neural coordination of hand function, enhancing our understanding of motor control and its modulation. This approach may offer a foundation for studying motor dysfunction in conditions such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and neurodegenerative diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Evidence implicates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in deploying schemas in new situations congruent with previously acquired knowledge. But how does this role affect learning of a conflicting behavioral schema? Here we addressed this question by recording single-unit activity in the OFC of rats learning odor problems with identical external information but orthogonal rules governing reward. Consistent with schema formation, OFC representations adapted to track the underlying rules, and both performance and encoding was faster on subsequent than initial problems. Surprisingly however, when the rule governing reward changed, persistent representation of the prior schema was correlated with acquisition of the new. Thus, OFC was not a source of interference and instead supported new learning by accurately and independently representing the old schema as the new was acquired.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) pose a significant public health threat, particularly in children, where infections can lead to bloody diarrhea and progress to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening condition with long-term complications. Antibiotics are contraindicated in STEC infections due to their potential to induce prophages carrying Shiga toxin (stx) genes, triggering toxin production. Here, we present a CRISPR-based antimicrobial strategy that selectively targets and eliminates O157 STEC clinical isolates while preventing toxin release. We designed a Cas12 nuclease to cleave >99% of all stx variants found in O157 strains, leading to bacterial killing and suppression of toxin production. To enable targeted delivery, we engineered a bacteriophage-derived capsid to specifically transfer a non-replicative DNA payload to E. coli O157, preventing its dissemination. In a mouse STEC colonization model, our therapeutic candidate, EB003, reduced bacterial burden by a factor of 3x103. In an infant rabbit disease model, EB003 mitigated clinical symptoms, abrogated stx-mediated toxicity, and accelerated epithelial repair at therapeutically relevant doses. These findings demonstrate the potential of CRISPR-based antimicrobials for treating STEC infections and support further clinical development of EB003 as a precision therapeutic against antibiotic-refractory bacterial pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

PREFFECT uses generative models to fit distributions to observed expression counts while adjusting for technical and biological variables. The framework can exploit multiple expression profiles generated from matched tissues for a single sample (e.g., a tumor and morphologically normal tissue) in order to stabilize profiles and impute missing counts. PREFFECT can also leverage sample-sample adjacency networks that assist graph attention mechanisms to identify the most informative correlations in the data. We demonstrate how PREFFECT uses this information to more accurately compute downstream analyses such as sample clustering in several datasets.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

The spike protein undergoes extensive structural rearrangements, progressing through extended, partially folded, and fully folded intermediates prior to fusion-pore formation, a process that is dependent on protease cleavage and inhibited by the WS6 S2 antibody. Upon interaction with ACE2 receptor dimer, spikes cluster at membrane interfaces and following S2' cleavage concurrently transition to postfusion conformations encircling the hemifusion and pre-fusion pores in a distinct conical arrangement. Subtomogram averaging revealed that the WS6 S2 antibody binds to the spike's stem-helix, crosslinks and clusters prefusion spikes and inhibits refolding of fusion intermediates.

Despite various benchmarking efforts, existing studies remain limited in the number of GRN inference methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics. The absence of a universally accepted ground truth further complicates the evaluation, requiring continuous refinement of benchmarking strategies. In addition, regulatory interactions are highly context-specific and vary between perturbations, cell types, tissues, and organisms. However, current benchmarks do not account for this complexity, limiting their applicability in personalized medicine. Here, we introduce geneRNIB, a comprehensive GRN benchmarking framework built on three key principles: context-specific evaluation, continuous integration, and holistic assessment in the absence of a true reference network. geneRNIB enables the seamless incorporation of new algorithms, datasets, and evaluation metrics to reflect ongoing developments. In the current version, we systematically integrated and assessed ten GRN inference methods, spanning single- and multiomics approaches across five diverse datasets including thousands of perturbation scenarios. We introduced eight novel metrics specifically designed to assess context-specific causal inference. Our findings indicate that simple models with fewer assumptions often outperformed more complex pipelines. Notably, gene expression-based correlation algorithms yielded better results than more advanced approaches incorporating prior datasets or pre-trained on large datasets. In addition, we identified several potential factors that influence the performance of GRN inference and offered actionable guidelines for the future development of the method.

However, wildlife can also be impacted by spillover of viruses transmitted from humans or domestic animals. Many xenarthrans are vulnerable to extinction, underscoring the importance of monitoring potentially life-threatening viruses for conservation efforts. This study investigated the molecular presence of coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and poxviruses in free-ranging anteaters and armadillos from the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Among 236 animals tested, no coronavirus was identified, paramyxovirus was detected in four giant anteaters and one six-banded armadillo, and poxvirus in one giant anteater. All paramyxovirus-positive samples were identified by sequencing as Morbillivirus canis, and the poxvirus sample exhibited 88% identity to Molluscipoxvirus molluscum, indicating a potentially novel species. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of paramyxovirus and poxvirus in armadillos and giant anteaters in the wild, expanding the known host spectrum of both pathogens. Since Morbillivirus canis can be highly pathogenic to wildlife, and Molluscipoxvirus molluscum is a human disease, further studies should estimate the conservation implications and zoonotic risk associated with these pathogens. This underscores the importance of surveillance at the animal-human-environment interface to mitigate conservation threats and safeguard public health.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

MYC is regulated at multiple levels and its stability and activity is modulated by protein phosphorylation; although there is a reasonable knowledge of the kinases required for MYC modifications, the counteracting phosphatases have been understudied. Here we have investigated the role of the chromatin-associated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit CDCA2, also known as Repo-Man, in the regulation of MYC proteins in cancer cells. Using RNA interference and degron-mediated degradation of CDCA2, we have demonstrated that the PP1 subunit is required for MYC and MYCN stabilisation and viability of triple negative breast cancer, neuroblastoma and colon cancer cells. Proximity ligation assays indicate that both MYC and MYCN are in close proximity of CDCA2 in vivo.

Surprisingly, given the ubiquity of fluoride in oral healthcare, the underlying mechanisms by which fluoride kills bacteria remain unknown. Using dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans as a model, we show that fluoride elicits an uncontrolled stress response characterized by upregulation of competence pathways and extensive cell wall degradation. While limited autolysis is adaptive, we show that fluoride subverts the typical tight temporal control of the competence-associated alternative sigma factor ComX by specifically inhibiting assembly and activity of Clp ATPases, thus disrupting proteolytic degradation of ComX. Phenylalanine partially restores Clp protease activity, explaining the frequent presence of a gene encoding chorismate mutase in fluoride-responsive operons. Together, these findings reveal the molecular mechanism that underlie fluoride-dependent lysis in bacteria, and identify new pathways that could be exploited to potentiate the antimicrobial effects of oral fluoride.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

By reconstructing the temporal ordering of individual cells, TI cananalyze the mechanisms underlying development and disease progression. Various TI methods havebeen proposed and applied across diverse fields, including cancer research and immunology. How-ever, most existing methods rely solely on gene expression data and do not incorporate other omicsinformation such as DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and protein expression. To addressthis limitation, approaches that integrate multiple omics datasets for TI have been proposed. Never-theless, these methods typically assume the use of only common variables across datasets, makingit difficult to align heterogeneous data with differing measurement targets across omics layers. Thislimitation can lead to information loss and challenges in capturing interactions between differentomics datasets, which may reduce integration accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel TI methodthat captures interactions among variables across different omics layers and accommodates unpaireddatasets with non-overlapping measurement targets. By effectively capturing relationships betweendifferent omics layers, our approach enables a more comprehensive multi-omics TI framework, thusproviding deeper insights into cellular development.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

While shared phenotypic manifestation of adaptation to serpentine environments has been investigated in many species, it is still unclear whether there may be a common genetic basis underlying such responses. Here we assess local adaptation to serpentine soil and infer the parallel genetic signatures of local adaptation to serpentine environments in two thus far unexplored closely related species, Alyssum gmelinii and Alyssum spruneri (Brassicaceae). Then we measure gene- and function-level convergence with the previously explored Arabidopsis arenosa, to reveal candidate shared adaptive strategies within Brassicaceae. Methods We tested for adaptation using a reciprocal substrate-transplant experiment in A. gmelinii. Then, after assembling a reference genome, we generated population-level sequencing data of four population pairs and performed genome scans for directional selection to infer serpentine adaptive candidate genes in Alyssum. Finally, we compared candidate gene lists with those inferred in similar experiments in Arabidopsis arenosa and used protein-protein interaction networks to discern functional convergence in serpentine adaptation. Key Results Independent colonization of serpentine environments by Alyssum populations is associated with footprints of selection on genes related to ion transport and homeostasis, nutrient and water uptake, and life-history traits related to germination and reproduction. Reciprocal transplant experiments demonstrated that adapted plants germinate sooner and exhibit better growth in serpentine conditions while excluding heavy metals and increasing Ca uptake in their tissues. Finally, a significant fraction of such genes and molecular pathways is shared with Arabidopsis arenosa. Conclusions We show that genetic adaptation to the multi-factorial challenge imposed by serpentine environments involves key pathways that are shared not only between closely related species, but also between Brassicaceae tribes of ~20 Mya divergence.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

This system includes a defense protein, TerI, and two self-immunity proteins, anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2. TerI targets the terminase complex of invading phages to prevent DNA translocation into procapsids without halting the lytic cycle, leading to the release of unpacked non-infectious procapsids upon bacterial lysis. In contrast, the self-immunity proteins, anti-TerI1 and anti-TerI2, counteract TerI during prophage induction to allow virion production. This unique prophage-encoded anti-phage defense system, TERi, is prevalent in Listeria phages, providing population-level host protection without compromising the prophage lytic lifecycle.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This new color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens new opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long-term visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.

Purified mScarlet3 did not show an MFE, but addition of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and simultaneous illumination with blue and yellow light restored the MFE. Through extensive photophysical experiments, we developed a quantitative model of the giant MFE in mScarlet3-FMN mixtures. The key reaction step involved electron transfer from fully reduced FMNH2 to triplet-state mScarlet3, to form a triplet spin-correlated radical pair. The magnetic field then controlled the branching ratio between singlet recombination vs. triplet separation.

By contrast, many biological and environmental settings--ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet--feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially-uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner ""core"" that coexists with a more dilute, highly-motile surrounding ""shell"". By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use theory and simulations to develop quantitative principles describing this interplay--establishing a bio-physical framework that unifies all our experimental observations. Our work thereby sheds new light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations, and other forms of chemically-reactive living and active matter, in confined environments, and provides a way to predict and control these behaviors more broadly.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Here, we developed a bespoke stereochemically-paired spirocyclic oxindole aziridine covalent library and screened this library for degradation of MYC. Through this screen, we identified a hit covalent ligand KL2-236, bearing a unique sulfinyl aziridine warhead, that engaged MYC in vitro as pure MYC/MAX protein complex and in situ in cancer cells to destabilize MYC, inhibit MYC transcriptional activity and degrade MYC in a proteasome-dependent manner through targeting intrinsically disordered C203 and D205 residues.

Premature loss of chromosome cohesion proteins and untimely separation of chromosomes is thought to underly high rates egg aneuploidy during maternal aging. However, because chromosome cohesion loss occurs gradually over female reproductive lifespan and cytoskeletal defects alone can predispose eggs to chromosomal abnormalities, the root causes of exponential rise in egg aneuploidy at advanced reproductive ages remain a mystery. Here, we applied high-resolution live imaging to visualize for the first time cohesion protein dynamics underpinning meiotic chromosome segregation. To discover proteins whose dysfunction accelerates aneuploidies associated with female reproductive aging, we innovated the first experimental system in which chemically induced cohesion reduction rapidly triggers aging-like chromosomal abnormalities in young eggs. By integrating this direct cohesion manipulation system with quantitative high-resolution microscopy and targeted protein degradation tools, we identified the centromeric protein CENP-A as a new factor whose aging-like depletion causes a dramatic rise in premature separation of sister chromatids. Our work illuminates cohesion loss-independent origins of age-related egg aneuploidy and provides new avenues to discover therapeutic targets for extending the female reproductive lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

These responses can drive collective behaviours like photoaccumulation and photodispersion, which play a key role in broader biological functions like photosynthesis. Our understanding of these emergent phenomena is severely limited by difficulties in obtaining data needed to establish accurate models that can serve as a basis for multi-scale analyses. Here, we address this issue by developing an integrated experimental and computational platform to collect large temporal imaging datasets that allow for the inference of 'digital twins' - mathematically precise computational models that accurately mirror the behavior of individual microorganisms - and show that they can replicate the light response of diverse microorganisms in silico. We show that a generalised phenomenological model of movement can be effectively parameterised from experimental data to capture key behavioural traits of two commonly studied photo-responsive microorganisms (Euglena gracilis and Volvox aureus) and demonstrate our model's ability to accurate reproduce patterns of movement for individuals and populations in response to dynamic and spatially varying light patterns. This work takes steps towards the automated phenotyping of multi-scale behaviours in biology and complements high-throughput genome sequencing efforts by allowing for more comprehensive and quantitative genotype-to-phenotype mappings. It also unlocks new opportunities for the design of spatial control algorithms to guide collective microorganism behaviour.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

While various genome mining tools can identify and characterize gene clusters, they often overlook their evolutionary diversity, a crucial factor in revealing novel cluster functions and applications. To address this gap, we developed GATOR-GC, a targeted genome mining tool that enables comprehensive and flexible exploration of gene clusters in a single execution. We show that GATOR-GC identified a diversity of over 4 million gene clusters similar to experimentally validated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that other tools fail to detect. To highlight the utility of GATOR-GC, we identified previously uncharacterized co-occurring conserved genes potentially involved in mycosporine-like amino acid biosynthesis and mapped the taxonomic and evolutionary patterns of genomic islands that modify DNA with 7-deazapurines. Additionally, with its proximity-weighted similarity scoring, GATOR-GC successfully differentiated BGCs of the FK-family of metabolites (e.g., rapamycin, FK506/520) according to their chemistries. We anticipate GATOR-GC will be a valuable tool to assess gene cluster diversity for targeted, exploratory, and flexible genome mining.

These networks are often incomplete due to absent or unobserved information. Predicting these missing links is critical for many applications, including genome-wide association studies and phenotype prediction. Efforts have previously applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to this missing-link prediction problem, but these techniques too have limitations when the sparsity of the networks is very high. Here, we apply a novel feature engineering technique that uses local graph motif incidence to enhance the feature set for variational graph autoencoders (VGAE). We compare the performance of our technique against state-of-the-art approaches, and then progressively hide more and more of the original graph edges. Our results show that VGAEs with our local-area motif prevalence (LAMP) features outperform state-of-the-art node embeddings for a wide range of missing edges on both a benchmark and a biological dataset. We also observe that this combined VGAE and LAMP technique has the potential to facilitate the search for novel genetic interactions in an experimental adaptive sampling context with far fewer samples. Improvements to gene interaction imputation can lower the barrier to new pharmaceutical and epidemiological discoveries by revealing hidden gene interactions that steer the development of potential drug targets.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Lung organoids have emerged as an alternative model that partially overcomes this key disadvantage. Lung organoids can be cultured in various formats that offer potential for studying highly pathogenic viruses. However, the effects of these different formats on virus infection remain unexplored, leaving their relative value unclear. In this study, we generated primary lung organoids from human donor cells and used them to derive monolayers and air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures with the goal of comparing the replication kinetics of two circulating highly pathogenic coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection studies revealed that organoid-derived monolayers displayed limited infection and the innate immune response was impaired against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but not against virus-like double-stranded dsRNA or poly(I:C). Meanwhile, organoids and organoid-derived ALI cultures retained viral permissivity, with ALI cultures displaying diverse antiviral immune responses against both coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV demonstrated differential replication kinetics in organoid and organoid-derived ALI cultures. Therefore, primary organoid-derived cells in two-dimensional monolayer or three-dimensional ALI formats influence virus infection and host antiviral responses. Our study informs the selection of culture conditions for organoid-based respiratory disease research and therapeutic testing.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Past work suggests that imagined states are supported by the reinstatement of activity in sensory cortex, but transmodal systems within the canonical default network are also implicated in mind-wandering, recollection, and imagining the future. We identified brain systems supporting self-generated states using precision fMRI. Participants imagined different scenarios in the scanner, then rated their mental states on several properties using multi-dimensional experience sampling. We found that thinking involving scenes evoked activity within or near the default network, while imagining speech evoked activity within or near the language network. Imagining-related regions overlapped with activity evoked by viewing scenes or listening to speech, respectively; however, this overlap was predominantly within transmodal association networks, rather than adjacent unimodal sensory networks. The results suggest that different association networks support imagined states that are high in visual or auditory vividness.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

In particular, how QDR against a generalist necrotrophic pathogen evolved and whether it is driven by conserved or species-specific regulatory networks remains unclear. Here, we examined the transcriptomic responses of five diverse wild tomato species that span a gradient of QDR. We initially hypothesised that conserved regulatory modules might control QDR. Instead, we use differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to find that species-specific regulatory features, encompassing both infection-induced and constitutively expressed genes, predominantly shape QDR levels. Although we identified an ethylene response factor among candidate genes for QDR-regulation, it did not fully account for the phenotypic variation. To further dissect the evolutionary basis of these regulatory patterns, we performed phylotranscriptomic analyses on gene regulatory networks. Notably, our findings reveal that the conserved NAC transcription factor 29 is pivotal in developing disease resistance only in S. pennellii. The differential regulation and altered downstream signalling pathways of NAC29 provide evidence for its co-option in the resistance mechanisms of S. pennellii. This finding highlights the species-specific rewiring of gene regulatory networks by repurposing a conserved regulatory element to enhance resistance against pathogens effectively. These results offer new insights into the evolutionary and regulatory complexity underlying QDR and emphasise the significance of species-specific gene regulation in shaping resistance against a cosmopolitan necrotrophic pathogen.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

Here, we report a key role of the 2-OH group of ribose sugar in RNA condensation in the presence of divalent cations. We show that 2-deoxyribose inhibits nucleic acid phase separation and suppresses the intra-condensate networking transition, known as percolation, that underlies the condensate dynamical arrest. All-atom simulations reveal increased solvation and compaction of single-stranded DNA compared to RNA, suggesting an unintuitive role of chain flexibility in modulating heat-induced nucleic acid phase separation and percolation transitions. Further, 2-O-methylation (2-O-Me) of RNA, a common sugar modification, lowers the driving force of RNA phase transitions. These results highlight the diverse physicochemical parameters governing nucleic acid phase behavior and suggest how sugar modifications may have evolved to robustly tune the formation and dynamical arrest of RNA condensates.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526

To estimate gene expression heritability, standard models require a single gene expression value per individual, forcing data from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments to be pseudobulked. Here, we show that applying standard heritability models to pseudobulk data overestimates gene expression heritability and produces inflated false positive rates for detecting cis-heritable genes. Therefore, we introduce a new method called scGeneHE (single cell Gene expression Heritability Estimation), a Poisson mixed-effects model that quantifies the cis-genetic component of gene expression using individual cellular profiles. In simulations, scGeneHE has a consistently well-calibrated false positive rate for eGene detection and unbiasedly estimates cis-heritability at many parameter settings. We applied scGeneHE to scRNA-seq data from 969 individuals, 11 immune cell types, and 822,552 cells from the OneK1K cohort to infer cell-type-specificity of genetic regulation at risk genes for immune-mediated diseases and trace the fluctuation of cis-heritability across cellular populations of varying resolution. In summary, we developed a new statistical method that resolves the analytical challenge of estimating gene expression cis-heritability from native scRNA-seq data.","NA","biorxiv",1740953284526
