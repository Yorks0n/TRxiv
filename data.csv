We demonstrate the real world implications of the use of testing and evaluate adverse events and outcomes in individuals who did not receive pharmacogenomic testing for clopidogrel.

MethodsWe analyzed ~100K individuals with paired EHR and exome sequencing data from population health studies administered at multiple medical centers using the Helix Exome+(R) assay. We inferred clopidogrel dosage by processing the prescription with an LLM. We identified all instances of individuals with at least one prescription that is not in concordance with their CYP2C19 genotype. Lastly, we identify instances of thrombosis using a comprehensive codeset based on ICD9, ICD10, and SNOMED terms.

ResultsWe identified 16,140 prescriptions of clopidogrel given to 3,853 participants. We found that 29% of these individuals have a mismatch between the recommended clopidogrel dosage guideline based on their CYP2C19 genotype and their actual prescribed daily dosage. 25% of poor metabolizers experienced thrombosis, with 40% occurring within 2 months of treatment. Poor and intermediate metabolizers receiving clopidogrel are much more likely to experience thrombosis and myocardial infarction (binomial p-value = 0.001).

ConclusionsWe estimate a 38% excess of adverse events occur in poor and intermediate metabolizers relative to normal and rapid metabolizers. The lack of testing may be responsible for 1 thrombosis event per every ~30 people prescribed clopidogrel.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996599

DesignMatched cohort with cumulative and adjusted assessments of risk over 12 month follow up.

SettingFloridas state-level public health databases with records about COVID-19 vaccination, sociodemographic characteristics of vaccine recipients, location of vaccination, and vital statistics.

ParticipantsMatched cohort of 1,470,100 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents receiving at least two doses, less than six weeks apart, of either the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccine between December 18, 2020, and August 31, 2021.

InterventionInitial vaccination with two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273

Main outcome measuresAll-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality within 12 months after the second COVID-19 vaccine dose

ResultsThere were 9,162,484 noninstitutionalized adult Florida residents who met inclusion criteria, including 5,328,226 BNT162b2 vaccine recipients and 3,834,258 mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients. A total of 1,470,100 vaccinees were matched 1-to-1 based on seven criteria, including census tract. Compared with mRNA-1273 recipients, BNT162b2 recipients had significantly higher risk for all-cause mortality (847.2 vs. 617.9 deaths per 100,000; odds ratio, OR [95% CI]: 1.384 [1.331, 1.439]), cardiovascular mortality (248.7 vs. 162.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.540 [1.431, 1.657]), COVID-19 mortality (55.5 vs. 29.5 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.882 [1.596, 2.220]) and non-COVID-19 mortality (791.6 vs. 588.4 deaths per 100,000 persons; OR [95% CI]: 1.356 [1.303, 1.412]). Negative control outcomes did not show any indication of meaningful unobserved residual confounding.

ConclusionFlorida adults who received BNT162b2 had significantly higher risk of 12-month all-cause, cardiovascular, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 mortality compared to matched mRNA-1273 recipients. These findings are suggestive of differential non-specific effects of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, and potential concerning adverse effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

While generally described as positively charged amphipathic helices, presequences lack a consensus motif and thus likely promote the import of proteins into mitochondria with variable efficiencies. Indeed, the concept of presequence ""strength"" critically underlies biological models such as stress sensing, yet a quantitative analysis of what dictates ""strong"" versus ""weak"" presequences is lacking. Furthermore, the extent to which presequence strength affects mitochondrial function and cellular fitness remains unclear. Here, we capitalize on the high-throughput and kinetic nature of the MitoLuc mitochondrial protein import assay to quantify multiple aspects of presequence strength. We find that select presequences, including those that regulate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), are sufficient to impart differential import efficiencies during mitochondrial uncoupling. Surprisingly, we find that presequences beyond those classically associated with stress signaling promote highly variable import efficiency in stressed and basal (i.e., non-stressed) conditions in vitro, suggesting that presequence strength may influence a broader array of processes than currently appreciated. We exploit this variability to demonstrate that only presequences that promote robust import in vitro can fully rescue defects in respiratory growth in Complex IV-deficient yeast, suggesting that presequence strength dictates metabolic potential. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that presequence strength can describe numerous metrics, such as total imported protein, maximal import velocity, or sensitivity to uncoupling, suggesting that the annotation of presequences as ""weak"" versus ""strong"" requires more nuanced characterization than is typically performed. Importantly, we find that such variability in presequence strength meaningfully affects cellular fitness in processes beyond stress signaling, suggesting that organisms may broadly exploit presequence strength to fine-tune mitochondrial import and thus organellar homeostasis.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996599

Throughput can be increased by multiplexing samples in the mass domain with plexDIA, yet multiplexing along one dimension will only linearly scale throughput with plex. To enable combinatorial-scaling of proteomics throughput, we developed a complementary multiplexing strategy in the time domain, termed  timePlex. timePlex staggers and overlaps the separation periods of individual samples. This strategy is orthogonal to isotopic multiplexing, which enables combinatorial multiplexing in mass and time domains when paired together, and thus multiplicatively increased throughput. We demonstrate this with 3-timePlex and 3-plexDIA, enabling the multiplexing of 9 samples per LC-MS run, and 3-timePlex and 9-plexDIA exceeding 500 samples / day with a combinatorial 27-plex. Crucially, timePlex supports sensitive analyses, including of single cells. These results establish timePlex as a methodology for label-free multiplexing and combinatorial scaling of the throughput of LC-MS proteomics. We project this combined approach will eventually enable an increase in throughput exceeding 1,000 samples / day.

However, direct observations of rapid genetic adaptation and population dynamics across climates are rare across species. To fill this gap, we conducted a replicated, globally synchronized evolution experiment with the plant Arabidopsis thaliana for 5 years in over 30 outdoor experimental gardens with distinct climates across Europe, the Levant, and North America. We performed whole-genome sequencing on [~]70,000 surviving reproductive individuals and directly observed rapid and repeatable adaptation across climates. Allele frequency changes over time were parallel in experimental evolution replicates within the same climates, while they diverged across contrasting climates--with some allele frequency shifts best explained by strong selection between -46% to +60%. Screening the genome for signals of rapid climate adaptation identified a polygenic architecture with both known and novel adaptive genetic variants connected to important ecological phenotypes including environmental stress responses, CAM5 and HEAT SHOCK FACTORs, and germination and spring flowering timing, CYTOCHROME P450s and TSF. We found evolutionary adaptation trends were often predictable, but variable across environments. In warm climates, high evolutionary predictability was associated with population survival up to 5 years, while erratic trends were an early warning for population extinction. Together, these results show rapid climate adaptation may be possible, but understanding its limits across species will be key for biodiversity forecasting.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996599

We aimed to investigate appendiceal, proximal colon, distal colon, rectal, and anal cancer incidence trends by age and histology in Australia.

MethodsCancer incidence rate data were obtained from all Australian cancer registries (1990-2020 period). Birth cohort-specific incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and annual percentage change in rates were estimated using age-period-cohort modelling and joinpoint regression.

FindingsAfter excluding neuroendocrine neoplasms, early-onset cancer incidence rose 5-9% annually, yielding 5,341 excess cases (2 per 100,000 person-years; 12% appendix, 45% colon, 36% rectum, 7% anus; 20-214% relative increase). Trends varied by site, period, and age: appendiceal cancer rose from 1990-2020 in 30-49-year-olds; colorectal cancers rose from around 1990-2010 in 20-29-year-olds and from 2010-2020 in 30-39-year-olds; anal cancer rose from 1990-2009 in 40-49-year-olds. Across all sites, IRRs increased with successive birth cohorts since 1960. Notably, adenocarcinoma incidence in the 1990s versus 1950s birth cohort was 2-3-fold for colorectum and 7-fold for appendix. The greatest subtype-specific increases occurred for appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma, colorectal non-mucinous adenocarcinoma, and anal squamous cell carcinoma. Only later-onset (age [&ge;]50) colorectal and anal adenocarcinoma rates declined. Appendiceal tumours, neuroendocrine neoplasms (all sites), anorectal squamous cell carcinomas, and colon signet ring cell carcinomas rose across early-onset and later-onset strata.

InterpretationAppendiceal, colorectal, and anal cancer incidence is rising in Australia with variation across age and histology, underscoring the need to identify factors driving these trends.

Single-cell transcriptomics provides a detailed picture of the cellular states observed during these decisions, but building quantitative and predictive models from these data remains a challenge. Here, we present dynamic landscape analysis (DLA), a framework that applies dynamical systems theory to identify stable cell states, map transition pathways, and generate a predictive cell fate decision landscape from single-cell data. Applying this framework to vertebrate neural tube development, we reveal that progenitor specification by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) can be captured in a landscape with an unexpected circular topology, where initially divergent lineages converge through multiple routes. This landscape accurately predicted cellular responses and cell fate allocation for unseen dynamic signalling regimes. By modelling the dynamic responses that drive cell fate decisions, the DLA framework provides a quantitative and generative framework for extracting mechanistic insights from high-dimensional single-cell data.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Here, we revisit this question using one of the deepest metagenomic sequencing efforts to date, applying 148 Gbp of Nanopore long-read and 122 Gbp of Illumina short-read data to a single forest soil sample.

ResultsOur hybrid assembly reconstructed 837 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 466 high- and medium-quality genomes, nearly all lacking close relatives among cultivated taxa. Rarefaction and k-mer analyses reveal that, even at this depth, we capture only a fraction of the extant diversity: nonparametric models project that over 10 Tbp would be required to approach saturation. These findings offer a quantitative, technology-enabled update to long-standing diversity estimates and demonstrate that conventional metagenomic sequencing efforts likely miss the majority of microbial and biosynthetic potential in soil. We further identify over 11,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), >99% of which have no match in current databases, underscoring the breadth of unexplored metabolic capacity.

However, why do certain images remain unidentifiable while others can be recognized immediately, and what visual features drive subjective clarification? To address these critical questions, we developed a unique dataset of 1,854 ambiguous images and collected more than 100,000 participant ratings evaluating their identifiability before and after seeing undistorted versions of the images. Relating the representations of a brain-inspired neural network model in response to our images with human ratings, we show that subjective identification depends largely on the extent to which higher-level visual features from the original images are preserved in their ambiguous counterparts. Notably, the predominance of higher-level features over lower-level ones softens after participants disambiguate the images. In line with these results, an image-level regression analysis showed that the subjective identification of ambiguous images was best explained by high-level visual dimensions. Moreover, we found that the process of ambiguity resolution was accompanied by a notable decrease in semantic distance and a greater consistency in object naming among participants. However, the relationship between information gained after disambiguation and subjective identification was non-linear, indicating that acquiring more information does not necessarily enhance subjective clarity. Instead, we observed a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that subjective identification improves when the acquired information either strongly matches or mismatches prior predictions. Collectively, these findings highlight fundamental principles underlying the mapping between human visual perception and memory, advancing our understanding on how we resolve ambiguity and extract meaning from incomplete visual information.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

This qualitative study explores the lived experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) following the implementation of Covid-19 vaccine mandates in Alberta s health sector. It draws on 80 responses to a single open-ended question from a survey of 190 HCWs in the province across vaccination statuses. We performed a manual sentiment analysis, classifying entries as positive, neutral, or negative - depending on their normative orientation towards vaccination mandates - using Weberian ideal types as a conceptual framework. Most respondents (82.5%) expressed negative sentiments, with close to one fifth (17.5%) offering positive views; no entries were coded as neutral. Themes within negative responses included coercion, ethical conflict, professional exclusion, institutional betrayal, and suppression of dissent. Many vaccinated HCWs described complying under duress, challenging the assumption that signals endorsement. The most salient theme was that of moral injury - defined as the distress caused by acting against one s conscience, witnessing perceived harm, or remaining silent under institutional pressure. In contrast, positive responses emphasized professional duty and public safety, often rejecting the legitimacy of dissenting perspectives. Our findings underscore the deeply polarizing nature of vaccination mandates and complicate dominant narratives that equate compliance with consent. Further, in contrast to clinical conceptions rooted in combat or bedside trauma, our analysis situates moral injury in the structural conditions created by public health policies, offering a lens for assessing their implications for the wellbeing of HCWs, quality care, and ethical healthcare practice and policy. We conclude that future public health policies, especially those justified under claims of emergency, must include built-in safeguards for ethical integrity and democratic participation","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

Following an isolated report of H5N1 viral RNA being detected in milk from a sheep in the UK, we also carried out similar experiments with a laboratory strain of IAV in sheep's milk. Although the survival of influenza viruses in milk was variable, we consistently found that under laboratory conditions substantial viral infectivity remained over periods when people might reasonably be exposed to infected milk - for over a day at room temperature and for more than 7 days when refrigerated.

CHASERR is a broadly expressed lncRNA located immediately upstream of the promoter of the CHD2 gene. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting conserved motifs in CHASERR's last exon induce the formation of a fusion transcript joining CHASERR to CHD2. This fusion transcript is exported to the cytoplasm and translated into full-length CHD2 protein. Deleting the same motifs in mice mimics the ASO effect, increasing CHD2 protein without causing the deleterious effects associated with full CHASERR ablation. The fusion transcripts are also expressed endogenously, induced in activated neurons, and their constitutive induction affects neuronal gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Perinatal introduction of the ASO into Chd2+/- mice up-regulates CHD2 expression and alleviates behavioral phenotypes caused by CHD2 haploinsufficiency, providing a therapeutic route to CHD2 haploinsufficiency. This concept of targeting upstream genes with ASOs to induce transcript fusion can be extended to other gene pairs, and is thus a broadly relevant approach for increasing haploinsufficient gene expression.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

The full extent of protein dysfunctions in AD and their impact on cellular physiology remains unknown. Here, we used plexDIA, an approach that parallelizes the acquisition of samples and peptides, to characterize proteomic changes in AD. Using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue, we identified 281 differentially abundant proteins in AD. By systematically analyzing cellular compartment-specific shifts in protein abundance, we identified an AD-specific decrease in levels of the 20S proteasome, the catalytic core of the cell's primary protein degradation pathway. This alteration was accompanied by widespread decreases in proteasome subunit stoichiometries. Many proteasome substrate proteins were negatively correlated with 20S levels and increased in AD, suggesting that reduced 20S levels leads to abnormal protein accumulation. By analyzing proteins increased in AD, we identify key properties of such proteins. Namely, they have highly specific subcellular localizations and fast degradation rates, they contain signal sequences that allow them to be targeted for proteasomal degradation, and they are targeted by quality control pathways that recognize mislocalized proteins. Furthermore, we identify coherent sets of ubiquitin system enzymes, proteins that target substrates for proteasomal degradation, whose levels robustly discriminate AD from non-AD samples. One subset exhibited consistent increases in AD, while another exhibited consistent decreases, revealing complex alterations to the ubiquitin system in AD. Taken together, our results suggest that decreased ubiquitin-proteasome system capacity and impaired clearance of short-lived and mislocalized proteins contribute substantially to proteopathic burden in AD.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Label-free approaches are simple to implement but challenging to scale to thousands of samples per day. Multiplexed techniques, such as plexDIA, can address these limitations but remain restricted by the lack of mass tags optimized for data-independent acquisition (DIA) workflows. Here, we present a systematic approach screening a library of 576 compounds that identifies several small molecules that, when conjugated to peptides, improve their detection and sequence identification by mass spectrometry. The lead molecule, PSMtag, substantially increases the detection of fragment b-ions, which increases the confidence of sequence identification and enhances de novo sequencing. PSMtags allow 9-plexDIA, using only stable isotopes of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. As a result, it allows simultaneously increasing proteome coverage and sample throughput for plexDIA workflows without compromising quantitative accuracy. We demonstrate 240 samples-per-day with 9-plexDIA, while acquiring 28,359 protein data points in the same time label-free methods acquire 4,340. Our approach constitutes an expandable framework for designing mass tags to overcome existing limitations in multiplexed proteomics and provides plexDIA reagents capable of analyzing over 1,000 samples per day when using 10 minute runs. By facilitating higher throughput and improved identification, this innovation holds significant potential for accelerating proteomic studies across diverse biological and clinical applications.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Here, we compared whole-body exercise responses and skeletal muscle adaptations after strict 60-day bed rest in healthy people with those in patients with long COVID and ME/CFS, and healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Bed rest altered the respiratory and cardiovascular responses to (sub)maximal exercise, while patients exhibited respiratory alterations only at submaximal exercise. Bed rest caused muscle atrophy, and the reduced oxidative phosphorylation related to reductions in maximal oxygen uptake. Patients with long COVID and ME/CFS did not have muscle atrophy, but had less capillaries and a more glycolytic fibers, none of which were associated with maximal oxygen uptake. While the whole-body aerobic capacity is similar following bed rest compared to patients, the skeletal muscle characteristics differed, suggesting that physical inactivity alone does not explain the lower exercise capacity in long COVID and ME/CFS.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

MethodsEmployees of Cleveland Clinic in employment in Ohio on October 1, 2024, were included. The cumulative incidence of influenza among those in the vaccinated and unvaccinated states was compared over the following 25 weeks. Protection provided by vaccination (analyzed as a time-dependent covariate) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression.

ResultsAmong 53402 employees, 43857 (82.1%) had received the influenza vaccine by the end of the study. Influenza occurred in 1079 (2.02%) during the study. The cumulative incidence of influenza was similar for the vaccinated and unvaccinated states early, but over the course of the study the cumulative incidence of influenza increased more rapidly among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. In an analysis adjusted for age, sex, clinical nursing job, and employment location, the risk of influenza was significantly higher for the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated state (HR, 1.27; 95% C.I., 1.07 - 1.51; P = 0.007), yielding a calculated vaccine effectiveness of -26.9% (95% C.I., -55.0 to -6.6%).

ConclusionsThis study found that influenza vaccination of working-aged adults was associated with a higher risk of influenza during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season, suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza this season.

SummaryAmong 53402 working-aged Cleveland Clinic employees, we were unable to find that the influenza vaccine has been effective in preventing infection during the 2024-2025 respiratory viral season.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

Metacognitive ability is often measured through modeling the relationship between confidence reports and choice behavior in tasks where performance can be objectively measured. Previous work has explored whether metacognitive ability is conserved across different types of tasks, and across different domains such as perception and memory. However, it is unclear whether approaches to the assessment of metacognitive ability that have worked in these contexts can be extended to value-based decision-making where objective accuracy cannot be evaluated. Here, we compare metacognitive ability across different tasks spanning perception and valuation, using Bayesian hierarchical estimation of the parameters of a computational process model of confidence. This model captures metacognitive ability as the uncertainty of an individuals own decision uncertainty, and can do so in the space of any decision variable, regardless of whether it indexes external features or internal, subjective states. We find that metacognitive ability can be reliably estimated in both objective and subjective decision-making tasks, and is relatively well conserved across tasks, especially within domains and similar confidence reporting paradigms.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Deceased donor kidneys usually undergo cold storage until kidney transplantation, leading to cold ischemia injury that may contribute to poor graft outcomes. However, the molecular characterization of potential mechanisms of cold ischemia injury remains incomplete. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged spatial transcriptomics technology to perform full transcriptome characterization of cold ischemia injury (0-48 hours) using a murine model. We developed a computational workflow to identify spatiotemporal transcriptomic changes that accompany the injury pathophysiology in a compartment-specific manner. We identified potential metabolic reprogramming preferentially within the kidney inner medulla displaying strong oxidative phosphorylation signature in an ischemic environment. We found commonalities between the spatiotemporal transcriptomic presentation of cold ischemia and warm ischemia- reperfusion injury, including an induction of an anti-viral like immune response throughout the renal tissue. Altogether, these systems-level biological insights enabled by our full transcriptome temporal characterization unveil a molecular basis for how cold ischemia injury may negatively affect kidney outcomes. Moreover, our spatial analyses highlight pathological developments deep within the renal tissue, suggesting potential opportunities for new insights beyond biopsy-focused superficial tissue examinations. We also developed an interactive online browser at https://jef.works/vitessce-cold-ischemia/ to facilitate exploration of our results by the broader scientific and clinical community.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Consequently, predicting which genes will be affected by a particular genetic perturbation remains a challenge. Here, we analyze changes in genome-wide gene expression profiles caused by single-gene perturbations in bacterial, worm, and human cells and show a simple rule that genes that intrinsically maintain the ratio of expression levels (stoichiometry) with a perturbed gene are more likely to be affected when it is deleted or inactivated. Furthermore, deleting a gene that maintains their stoichiometry with more genes tend to affect the expression levels of other genes genome-wide. Stoichiometry-conserving gene clusters can be found beyond local transcriptional regulatory units and metabolic pathways. Thus, the effects of genetic perturbations are propagated to other genes through a multi-level stoichiometry-conserving architecture in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

However, although chromatin plays an integral role in regulating the function of regulatory elements along the nuclear genome, our understanding of how, or whether, similar chromatin structures form on plasmids transfected into mammalian cells remains limited. We demonstrate that plasmid single-molecule chromatin fiber sequencing (plasmid Fiber-seq) can accurately map chromatin architectures along individual, full-length transfected plasmid molecules at near single-nucleotide resolution. Application of plasmid Fiber-seq to diverse plasmids and cell lines demonstrates that plasmids are chromatinized in a sequence-dependent organized manner and adopt a heterogeneous and incomplete chromatin architecture relative to nuclear-encoded chromatin fibers. We show that the focal occupancy of nucleosomes and transcription factors along transfected plasmids is central to their transcriptional activity within mammalian cells, and demonstrate that plasmids indeed are capable of recapitulating nuclear genome-encoded chromatin architectures, although not always. Finally, we demonstrate that combining plasmid Fiber-seq with high-throughput reporter assays can establish the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenic non-coding variants, including disentangling the effects of transcriptional activators and repressors with near-single-nucleotide resolution. Overall, our findings reveal the principles by which plasmid-based assays can be used for accurate fine-scale mapping of chromatin-dependent regulatory grammar.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

They continue to be important therapeutic targets for multiple disorders including autoimmune diseases, acute and chronic inflammation, and allergy-related conditions. Recent structural coverage has provided important insights into their activation and signaling, however, confounding observations in the literature related to ligand efficacy and functional responses, especially in different model systems, present a major challenge for drug discovery efforts. Here, we systematically and comprehensively profile a broad set of natural and synthetic ligands at C3aR and C5aR1 and discover a previously unanticipated level of functional specialization in terms of species-specific pharmacology and receptor activation. Taking a lead from this, we determine seventeen cryo-EM structures of different ligand-receptor-G-protein complexes and uncover distinct orientation of agonists between the human and mouse receptors despite an overlapping positioning in the orthosteric binding pocket. Combined with extensive mutagenesis and functional assays, these structural snapshots allow us to decode and validate a convergent molecular mechanism involving a ""Five-Point-Switch"" in these receptors that orchestrates the recognition and efficacy of diverse agonists. We also identify species-specific differences at the level of phosphorylation patterns encoded in the carboxyl-terminus of these receptors and directly visualize their impact on {beta}arr binding and activation using cryo-EM structures. Interestingly, we observe that {beta}arrs engage with the mouse C5aR1 using a variation of previously discovered P-X-P-P phosphorylation motif via a ""Sliding-Mechanism"" and also exhibit distinct oligomeric state for the human vs. mouse receptors.

Stable-isotope analysis revealed that organic-carbon uptake dominates CO2 fixation in darkness under mixotrophy, with CO2 an apparent metabolic trigger. Galdieria sulphuraria 5587.1 can consume up to 8.3 g carbon L-1 day-1 from industrial confectionery waste, with C-phycocyanin reaching 3.8% of dry biomass and remaining thermostable at 72{degrees}C. This framework can optimize Galdieria-based bioprocesses for inexpensive waste conversion into high-value biomass and identifies CO2 as a trigger of organic-carbon assimilation, even in heterotrophic conditions.

Research institutions typically respond to this need by providing mandatory or optional training opportunities for their staff. However, there is no established resource for group leaders to improve their lab culture with concrete action points for implementation. Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of thirty ""commitments"" which can be verifiably actioned without requiring institutional support. These commitments were collaboratively developed by thirteen group leaders in life sciences, from institutions across eight countries, instigated through the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop. The importance of each commitment has been scored by more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, from more than twenty countries. Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments. Given the high importance-scores and low-implementation rates, the SAFE Labs Handbook represents a unique, community-driven tool with significant potential to improve lab culture on a global scale.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Primary producers transform this dissolved inorganic carbon into biomass that can subsequently flow into other trophic levels, or be released back into the environment through viral lysis. While there is substantial knowledge about the diversity and activity of viruses infecting photoautotrophic primary producers, little is known about viruses infecting chemoautotrophs, representing a gap in our understanding of key microbial processes driving global carbon cycles. Here, we combine metagenomics with 12/13C stable isotopic probing mesocosm experiments in a marine-derived meromictic pond to quantify lineage-specific carbon cycling activity to identify key microbial populations driving carbon cycling. We then tracked the flow of carbon from active chemoautotrophs to their viruses and found evidence supporting virus-mediated recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass through the production of viral particles. In particular, active populations of hydrogen/sulfur-oxidizing chemoautotrophs (Thiomicrorhabdus, Hydrogenovibrio, Sulfurimonas, Sulfurovum) were targeted by viruses. Considering the widespread distribution of chemoautotrophs on Earth, we postulate that this previously overlooked component of the microbial carbon cycle is a globally relevant process that has implications for our planets carbon cycle. This work provides the foundation for revealing the role of viral lysis in chemoautotrophic primary production and builds toward biogeochemical models that incorporate viral recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass.

Summary statementThe diversity, mechanisms, and processes governing microbial primary production and the recycling of autotrophic biomass are fundamental to our planets carbon cycle. These processes have implications for carbon sequestration, ocean biogeochemistry, and the overall balance of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Beneath the Earths sunlit layer, primary production is driven by microbial chemoautotrophs that derive energy from the oxidation of reduced compounds, such as hydrogen and sulfur, to form the base of the food web. Growing evidence suggests that aquatic ecosystems fueled by chemoautotrophy are widely distributed on Earth, ranging from beneath ice shelves to coastal upwelling regions to oxygen minimum zones, deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, groundwater, and meromictic ponds and lakes2-7. Studying microbial processes regulating chemoautotrophic primary production and the recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass is fundamental to our understanding of global carbon cycles.

While the diversity, function, and activity of viruses targeting photoautotrophs have been well-described across aquatic ecosystems8, we have little understanding of viruses involved in the recycling of chemoautotrophic biomass. Viruses are a major source of cellular mortality and carbon cycling in aquatic environments9-11. Viral lysis is estimated to transform [~]150 gigatonnes of carbon annually from biomass back into the environment, equivalent to [~]25 times that of the oceans biological carbon pump12,13. Despite recognition of the important role of viruses in aquatic habitats, there is a large gap in our understanding of the impact of viruses on globally distributed chemoautotrophs2,4,5,14-18. In this study, we show that viruses are not merely passive players but active agents recycling carbon fixed by productive chemoautotrophs, fundamentally reshaping how we view carbon and nutrient cycling in redox-active ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Our current understanding of prophage activation is largely shaped by a narrow set of traditional DNA-damaging inducers, such as mitomycin C and ciprofloxacin, which trigger the bacterial SOS response. This study employed high-throughput screening of 3,921 compounds to identify novel prophage inducers using model lambdoid prophage HK97. We identified multiple new inducers across diverse pharmacological classes, including dietary supplements and therapeutics. Despite the variety in compounds, all acted through SOS-dependent pathways. However, bleomycin, an antineoplastic antibiotic, demonstrated broad-spectrum and potent prophage induction exceeding standard inducers, with activity validated across multiple phages and bacterial hosts. These findings expand the repertoire of prophage inducers into commonly ingested xenobiotics, and introduce Bleomycin as a powerful, cost-effective tool for prophage research.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) have emerged as key contributors to promoter selectivity, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we use single-molecule optical tweezers to dissect how IDRs influence DNA binding by Msn2, a yeast stress-response regulator. We show that IDRs facilitate initial non-specific association with DNA and promote one-dimensional diffusion toward target motifs, supported by charge-mediated interactions. Remarkably, the IDR-dependent search mechanism displays sequence sensitivity, with promoter-derived sequences enhancing both initial binding and sliding rates, demonstrating that Msn2-DNA interactions alone are sufficient to confer promoter selectivity in the absence of chromatin or cofactors. These findings provide direct mechanistic evidence for how IDRs tune transcription factor search dynamics and expand sequence recognition beyond canonical motifs, supporting a mechanism for promoter selectivity in complex genomic contexts.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Their target genes and focus cell types are often unknown, partially because some effects are hidden in untested cell states. B cells play important roles in IMDs, including autoimmune, allergic, infectious, and cancerous diseases. However, despite this established importance, B cell activation states are underrepresented in functional genomics studies. In this study, we obtained B cells from 26 healthy female donors. We stimulated B cells in vitro with six activation conditions targeting key pathways: the B cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR9, CD40, and a cocktail that promotes differentiation into double negative 2 (DN2) IgD- CD27- CD11c+ CD21- B cells, a likely pathogenic B cell subset for autoimmunity that is also expanded in infectious diseases. We profiled up to 24 human B cell activation states and up to 5 control conditions using RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq coupled with surface protein markers (CITE-seq), and ATAC-seq. We provide an in-depth characterization of how IMD-associated genes responded to stimuli and group into modules with distinct functions. Using high-depth RNA-seq data, we found pervasive splicing effects during B cell activation. Using single-cell data, we describe stimulus-dependent B cell fates. Chromatin data reveal the transcription factors likely involved in stimulus-dependent B cell activation. These open chromatin regions capture a significant proportion of the genetic risk of IMDs and elucidate IMD genetic risk variants with previously unknown function. These data are shared via an interactive browser that can be used to query the dynamics of gene regulation and B cell differentiation during activation by different stimuli, enhancing further investigation of B cells and their role in IMDs.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

These critical satiety neurons are strongly affected by a high-fat diet, yet the impact on their functional properties remains unknown. We used fiber photometry to track PVHMC4R neurons responses to the consumption of drops of milkshake in animals fed a chow diet or a high-fat diet (HFD), both after obesity was established and after its reversal. PVHMC4R neurons in HFD-fed animals showed greater consumption-evoked responses than chow-fed animals at the early stages of meal consumption, and these responses did not increase further during the meal. HFD-fed animals also showed reduced licking vigor and motivation to consume Ensure. Switching HFD-fed obese animals to a normal chow diet (NCD) re-engaged the motivation to consume Ensure, partially restoring early-meal neural responses to a lower level, but did not restore the increase in consumption-evoked response magnitude across the meal.

We demonstrate that ER estrogen signaling upregulates the bacterial metabolite SCFA receptor Olfr78 on colonic L-cells, increasing PYY release and their sensitivity to acetate. Elevated PYY acts on neighboring EC cells via NPY1R, thereby enhancing serotonin release and gut pain.

This ability arises from the signal sent by muscle spindles to the brain. While there is clear evidence for age-related changes in the quantity of muscle spindles and in their sensitivity, behavioral assessment of age-related changes in position sense have produced mixed findings. Yet, study results are difficult to compare since there is no golden standard for assessment of proprioception. Therefore, we measured upper limb proprioception across several standard proprioceptive tasks together with key factors that could influence behavioral results such as touch, motor function, and cognition in 37 young (19-32 years old) and 35 older (53-71 years old) adults. We tested age-related differences in behavioral outcomes and their associations across tasks. Our results showed that age-related effects were very variable across position sense tasks, ranging from tasks where older participants performed better to tasks where they exhibit large age-related differences in position sense. These results were confirmed by meta-analysis based on data from hundreds of participants tested in our laboratory on the exact same tasks. Even within a task, different outcomes exhibit opposite age-related effects. Associations between outcome variables across or within proprioceptive tasks were overall negligible to weak. In conclusion, age-related changes in proprioception are limited, task- and outcome- dependent, and current tasks used to assess proprioception do not provide consistent evidence of age- related impairment in upper limb proprioception.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

These processes are tightly controlled, and one of the key modulators involved is the endocannabinoid system, particularly through the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1). CB1 is widely expressed in various hippocampal cell types. While it is known that CB1 participates in memory processes, its specific roles in different cell types and how these roles may differ between sexes remain unclear.

This study investigates how CB1 signaling in the hippocampus, in both, cell-type-specific and sex-dependent manner, contributes to navigation and memory. To this end, we selectively deleted CB1 receptors from neurons, CAMKII-expressing neurons, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of adult male and female mice. We then assessed its effect on a broad range of behaviors, including innate emotional responses, memory, navigation, and other hippocampus-related functions such as nesting.

Deletion of CB1 in CAMKII-expressing neurons produced a pronounced effect in males, leading to increased anxiety and impairments in both reference and spatial memory. These mice also showed altered performance in the Barnes maze, relying less on spatial strategies. By contrast, females were less affected by this specific deletion. Interestingly, only deletion of CB1 from astrocytes led to spatial memory impairments in females, which also showed reduced LTP and a decreased reliance on spatial strategies in the Barnes maze. In conclusion, our findings show that neuronal CB1 receptors are critical for the spatial navigation strategy in males, while astrocytic CB1 receptors play a key role in memory processes both in males and females.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

We aimed to compare Germany-wide characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized adults with diabetes in diabetes certified vs. non-diabetes certified hospitals.

MethodsWe analyzed in the German Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) statistics for 2021-2023 all inpatient cases aged [&ge;] 20 years with and without diabetes (all types) as a main or secondary diagnosis based on ICD-10 codes. Using Wilcoxon and Chi2-tests, characteristics of inpatient cases with diabetes were compared between diabetes certified hospitals (n=300) and non-diabetes certified hospitals (n=1,103).

ResultsOf 43.4 million total inpatient cases in the period from 2021 to 2023, 8.1 million (18.5%) had a documented diabetes diagnosis (94% of the cases as secondary diagnosis). In certified hospitals, 19.0% of inpatient cases had diabetes compared to 18.3% in non-certified hospitals. Although inpatient cases with diabetes had more hospital-acquired and procedure-related complications (17.2% vs. 16.7%, p<0.001), as well as higher rates of hypoglycemia (3.2% vs. 2.1%, p<0.001) and metabolic disorder (diabetic ketoacidosis: 0,5% vs. 0,4%; acute metabolic disorder with multiple complications: 2.3% vs. 1.0%, p<0.001) in certified hospitals vs. non-certified hospitals, in-hospital mortality for all diabetes cases was similar (4.5% in both). However, among those with diabetes as the main diagnosis, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in diabetes certified hospitals (type 1 diabetes: 0.6% vs. 1.1% and type 2 diabetes: 2.3% vs. 2.9%, both p<0.001), despite a higher complication burden.

ConclusionsHospitalized people with diabetes as the main diagnosis had lower in-hospital mortality in diabetes-certified hospitals, even though they had a higher disease burden. These findings suggest that expanded use of DDG-certified departments, including consultation services for patients whose diabetes is a secondary diagnosis, may further improve clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

This approach offers a new perspective on soft and living matter, revealing how geometry and activity can be harnessed to program synthetic materials, and how Lagrangian strain and principal deformation directions can help uncover mechanosensitive processes and directional cues in morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

H3K4me2 in plants is correlated with transcriptionally repressed states, which can be accounted for by transcription-coupled active H3K4me2 demethylation, but the converse molecular pathway by which H3K4me2 represses transcription remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that H3K4me2 colocalizes with the facultatively repressive marks H2A.Z, H2A ubiquitination (H2Aub), and H3K27me3 in the gene body. Our genetic analyses reveal that H3K4me2 functions upstream but not downstream of these repressive marks. Interestingly, in genes with diurnal H3K4me2 oscillation, H3K4me2 oscillates in antiphase with transcription but in phase with H2A.Z. In addition, the genetic manipulation of H3K4me2 affects the oscillating profiles of H2A.Z, suggesting the efficient relay from H3K4me2 to H2A.Z. Notably, the diurnal oscillation of H2Aub is much weaker than that of H2A.Z despite the overall similarity in their distributions. These results suggest that H3K4me2 orchestrates H2A.Z and H2Aub with distinct dynamics. Our findings reveal that plants employ H3K4me2 to transmit transcriptional cessation into repressive chromatin states.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

To monitor ethylene in plants, analytical methods, phenotypic assays, gene expression analysis, and transcriptional or translational reporters are typically employed. In the model plant Arabidopsis, two ethylene-sensitive synthetic transcriptional reporters have been described, 5xEBS:GUS and 10x2EBS-S10:GUS. These reporters harbor a different type, arrangement, and number of homotypic cis-elements in their promoters and thus may recruit the ethylene master regulator EIN3 in the context of alternative transcriptional complexes. Accordingly, the patterns of GUS activity in these transgenic lines differ and neither of them encompasses all plant tissues even in the presence of saturating levels of exogenous ethylene. Herein, we set out to develop and test a more sensitive version of the ethylene-inducible promoter that we refer to as EBSnew (abbreviated as EBSn). EBSn leverages a tandem of ten non-identical, natural copies of a novel, dual, everted, 11bp-long EIN3-binding site, 2EBS(-1). We show that in Arabidopsis, EBSn outperforms its predecessors in terms of its ethylene sensitivity, having the capacity to monitor endogenous levels of ethylene and displaying more ubiquitous expression in response to the exogenous hormone. We demonstrate that the EBSn promoter is also functional in tomato, opening new avenues to manipulating ethylene-regulated processes, such as ripening and senescence, in crops.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

In the spinal cord, different ""cardinal classes"" of neurons that share a common molecular identity are produced from spatially segregated progenitor domains. Within many such classes, a stereotyped sequence of divergent neuronal types of related function is generated over time, raising the question of the molecular mechanisms that control this process. Here, we show that the successive expression of mouse transcription factors Onecut2, Pou2f2 and Pou3f1 within the cardinal classes giving rise to motor and sensory circuits, correlates with the emergence of sequentially generated subpopulations of neurons within those domains. We demonstrate that the genetic loss of Pou2f2 results in impaired development of two early-born motor neuron columns and re-specification of anterolateral system projection neurons as a later-born subset. Similarly, we show that Pou3f1 expression is required for the normal development of later-born subsets of motor neurons and anterolateral system projection neurons. Together, our observations provide functional evidence that horologic diversification of output neurons of spinal motor and sensory circuits are driven by a conserved sequential order of expression of transcription factors.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

TE silencing is thus critical, and is initiated by maternally loaded piRNAs, leading to their repression.

Consistently, paternally inherited TEs are derepressed in the progeny of Drosophila crosses involving a naive female. TEs have also been found to be derepressed in interspecific crosses, which is proposed to result from suboptimal interactions of piRNA pathway proteins. Fundulus heteroclitus and F. diaphanus hybridize in nature and produce viable and fertile offspring that sometimes reproduce asexually. We characterized the repetitive DNA content of these species and their asexually reproducing hybrids. TE load was slightly higher than expected in hybrids and associated with younger repeats.

The number and identity of vertebrae are ultimately determined by somitogenesis and subsequent anterior-posterior regionalisation, largely governed by hox gene expression. Interspecific variation in vertebral count and regionalisation therefore reflects evolutionary changes in somite number and homeotic identity following species divergence. While many macroevolutionary studies have examined homeotic and non-homeotic changes in the vertebral column, few have explored these dynamics in teleosts, despite their exceptional species richness. Using African cichlids as a model, we show that shifts in vertebral regionalisation can arise through modifications to anterior-posterior patterning, but that much of the observed variation is driven by changes in somite number, with homeotic effects emerging largely as a by-product of somitic changes. Moreover, low intraspecific variation in vertebral count, lacking phylogenetic structure, suggests that somitic count variation within species is strongly canalised and has remained consistent throughout the diversification of African cichlids. In addition, we find no correlation between intraspecific variation in vertebral counts and mean vertebral counts, and this variation does not consistently scale with body aspect ratio among individuals. Therefore, intraspecific variation is decoupled from both macroevolutionary patterns of vertebral count evolution and body shape diversification. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between somitogenesis and homeotic transformations in shaping vertebral diversity and underscore the value of cichlids as a model for understanding the developmental basis of axial evolution in teleosts.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have been extensively studied experimentally, much of our understanding of how plasticity is organized across populations of neurons during task learning comes from training artificial neural networks (ANNs) using computational methods. However, the architectures of modern ANNs and the algorithms used to train them are not compatible with fundamental principles of neuroscience, leaving a gap in understanding how the brain coordinates learning across multiple layers of neural circuitry. Here we leverage recent experimental evidence to test an emergent theory that biological learning depends on specialization of distinct neuronal cell types and compartmentalized signaling within neuronal dendrites. We demonstrate that multilayer ANNs comprised of separate recurrently connected excitatory and inhibitory cell types, and neuronal units with separate soma and dendrite compartments, can be trained to accurately classify images using a fully biology-compatible deep learning algorithm called dendritic target propagation. By adhering to strict biological constraints, this model is able to provide unique insight into the biological mechanisms of learning and to make experimentally testable predictions regarding the roles of specific neuronal cell types in coordinating learning across different brain regions.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

We aimed to identify and validate parsimonious transcriptomic signatures that accurately predict fatal outcomes within 48 hours of hospitalization.

MethodsWe studied 894 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 20 US hospitals and enrolled in the prospective Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and nasal swabs collected within 48 hours of admission. Host gene expression was assessed by RNA sequencing, nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured by RT-qPCR, and mortality was assessed at 28 days. We first defined transcriptional signatures and biological features of fatal COVID-19, which we compared against mortality signatures from an independent cohort of patients with non-COVID-19 sepsis (n=122). Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression in 70% of the COVID-19 cohort, we trained parsimonious prognostic classifiers incorporating host gene expression, age, and viral load. The performance of single and three-gene classifiers was then determined in the remaining 30% of the cohort and subsequently externally validated in an independent, contemporary COVID-19 cohort (n=137) with vaccinated patients.

ResultsFatal COVID-19 was characterized by 4189 differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood, representing marked upregulation of neutrophil degranulation, erythrocyte gas exchange, and heme biosynthesis pathways, juxtaposed against downregulation of adaptive immune pathways. Only 7.6% of mortality-associated genes overlapped between COVID-19 and sepsis due to other causes. A COVID-specific three-gene peripheral blood classifier (CD83, ATP1B2, DAAM2) combined with age and SARS-CoV-2 viral load achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.94). A three-gene nasal classifier (SLC5A5, CD200R1, FCER1A), in comparison, yielded an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.64-0.83). Notably the expression of OLAH alone, a gene recently implicated in severe viral infection pathogenesis, yielded an AUC of 0.86 (0.79-0.93). Both peripheral blood classifiers demonstrated comparable performance in vaccinated patients from an independent external validation cohort (AUCs 0.74- 0.80).

ConclusionsA three-gene peripheral blood signature, as well as OLAH alone, accurately predict COVID-19 mortality early in hospitalization, including in vaccinated patients. These parsimonious blood- and nasal-based classifiers merit further study as accessible prognostic tools to guide triage, resource allocation, and early therapeutic interventions in COVID-19.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

Adaptation of NVJ functions to metabolic cues is mediated by a striking remodeling of the size and the proteome of the contact site, but the extent and the molecular determinants of this plasticity are not fully understood. Using microscopy-based screens, we monitored NVJ remodeling in response to glucose availability. We identified Pex31, Nsg1, Nsg2, Shr5, and Tcb1 as NVJ residents. Glucose starvation typically results in an expansion of the NVJ size and proteome. Pex31 shows an atypical behavior, being specifically enriched at the NVJ at high glucose conditions. Loss of Pex31 uncouples NVJ remodeling from glucose availability, resulting in recruitment of glucose starvation-specific residents and NVJ expansion at glucose replete conditions. Moreover, PEX31 deletion results in alterations of sterol ester storage and a remodeling of vacuolar membranes that phenocopy glucose starvation responses.

We show NPM1c phase separation is necessary and sufficient to coordinate the recruitment of NUP98 and KMT2A to condensates. Through extensive mutagenesis and pharmacological destabilization of phase separation, we find that NPM1c condensates are necessary for regulating gene expression, promoting in vivo expansion, and maintaining the undifferentiated leukemic state. Finally, we show that nucleoporin and KMT2A fusion proteins form condensates that are biophysically indistinguishable from NPM1c condensates.

Through a perturbation analysis we identify a regulatory checkpoint which ensures that the compaction of the genome into two spatially segregated nucleoids only occurs once cells have assembly a division ring - which also defines the axis of DNA segregation. Finally, we show that DNA compaction and segregation depends, in part, on a ParA homologue, SegA, and its partner SegB, whose absence leads to bridging DNA.

Recent studies have suggested that these changes can be partially explained by altered sensory feedback processing when producing speech. Individuals with PD (IwPD) may fail to monitor sensory feedback from their own voice, impairing their ability to adjust voice and speech when sensory input differs from expectations. In this study, we investigated sensory feedback processing in PD by looking at the sensory attenuation typically observed in event-related responses (ERP) to the self-generated voice. When sensory feedback processing is intact, the P50, N100, and P200 ERP responses to the self-generated voice are more attenuated than to an externally-generated voice. Twenty-three IwPD and 23 healthy controls (HCs) participated in a voice playback study that comprised three conditions: self-generated voice (auditory-motor condition; AMC), externally-generated voice (auditory-only condition; AOC), and motor-only. The AMC and AOC conditions also included an amplitude modulation of the voice (0/+15dB). Linear mixed models assessed group differences in ERP morphology. While groups did not differ in their P50 and P200 responses, there was a significant group-condition-loudness interaction for the N100. Follow-up analyses showed that IwPD displayed much larger N100 error responses for unexpected loudness modulations as compared to HC. This observation suggests that IwPD may process voice modulations differently than HC. The hypersensitivity to loudness changes may underlie IwPD's difficulties in processing and adapting their voice acoustics.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Although amyloidosis and aggregation of the 42-amino acid amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}42) have long been considered pathogenic triggers for AD, clinical evidence linking high levels of A{beta}42 with normal cognition challenges this hypothesis. To resolve this conundrum on the role of A{beta}42 in regulating synaptic activity, we used an adeno-associated viral vector approach that triggers extracellular accumulation of A{beta}42 and spatial memory impairment. We show that A{beta}42 leads to an early increase in excitatory and proximal inhibitory synaptic transmission onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and an increased expression of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 in these cells. A{beta}42 accumulation does not cause early cognitive deficits unless accompanied by an increased neuronal GLT-1 expression, suggesting this transporter is a critical mediator of A{beta}42 s effects. These findings unveil key molecular and cellular mechanisms implicated with AD pathogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

However, it remains unclear why these taxa are so dominant across a wide range of soil types and environmental conditions. Here we use genome-resolved metagenomics to test the hypothesis that strain-level differences exist in these taxa that are not adequately captured with standard marker gene sequencing, and that distinct strains harbor unique traits that reflect adaptations to different soil environments. We analyzed data from 331 natural soils spanning Australia to assess strain differentiation in Bradyrhizobium, a dominant soil bacterial genus of ecological importance. We developed a workflow for strain-level bacterial analyses of complex soil metagenomes, combining genomes from pre-existing databases with new genomes generated via targeted assembly from metagenomes to detect 181 Bradyrhizobium strains across the soil collection. In addition to a high degree of phylogenetic variation, we observed substantial variation in pangenome content and inferred traits, highlighting the breadth of diversity within this widespread genus. While members of the genus Bradyrhizobium were detected in > 80% of samples, most individual strains were restricted in their distributions. The overall strain-level community composition of Bradyrhizobium varied significantly across geographic space and environmental gradients, and was particularly associated with differences in temperature, soil pH, and soil nitrate and metal concentrations. Our work provides a general framework and methodology for studying the strain-level ecology of soil bacteria and highlights the ecological and pangenomic diversity within this dominant soil bacterial genus.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Previously, we demonstrated that nanoscale packing domains couple heterochromatin (cores) and euchromatin (outer zone) into unified reaction volumes that can generate transcriptional memory. In prior work, this framework demonstrated that RNA synthesis occurred within the ideal zone (intermediate density) portions of the domain. Naturally, this creates a question of where genes are positioned in relation to the packing domain architecture and which genetic material fills the domain core to sustain transcription. Here we propose that this could be solved by the encoded positioning of introns, intergenic segments, and exons as a projection of the functional packing layers of domains. This suggests that introns and intergenic segments are coupled to adjacent exons to generate coherent packing domain volumes. We illustrate how this organization would reconcile contradictions in epigenetic patterns, non-randomness in oncogenic mutations, and produce durable transcriptional memory. We conclude by showing that this genome geometry might have coincided with the rapid evolution of body-plan complexity, suggesting that chromatin geometry could be fundamental to metazoan evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

This unexpected function emerged from a comprehensive analysis of mesogleal basement membrane biogenesis. We show that the global dynamics of this extracellular matrix transduce muscular hydraulics to drive tissue rearrangement and stabilize shape, while localized FGFRb-dependent matrix remodeling establishes the aboral valve.

Pharmacologically enhancing the cargo-targeting capacity of SARs presents an attractive but underexplored strategy for the precise therapeutic activation of autophagy. Here, we characterise SQ-1, a small-molecule activator of autophagy that targets the prototypical SAR protein p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome-1). We show that SQ-1 sensitises p62 to oxidation and promotes its disulphide-mediated oligomerisation in response to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). This ROS-dependent activation of p62-mediated selective autophagy enhances the clearance of ROS-generating mitochondria and restores cell viability in models of Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, which is marked by impaired autophagic flux. In summary, the unique mode of action of SQ-1 enables self-regulated autophagy activation, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for lysosomal storage disorders and a broader spectrum of age-related diseases characterised by defective autophagy.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

With the advent of the new Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) CHM13 reference genome, exploring its effect on dark regions is prudent. In this study, we systematically analyze dark regions across four human genome references--HG19, HG38 (with and without alternate contigs), and CHM13--using both short- and long-read sequencing data. We found that dark regions increase as the reference becomes more complete, especially dark-by-MAPQ regions, but that long-read sequencing significantly reduces the number of dark regions in the genome, particularly within gene bodies. However, we identify potential alignment challenges in long-read data, such as centromeric regions. These findings highlight the importance of both reference genome selection and sequencing technology choice in achieving a truly comprehensive genomic analysis.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

However, evidence of hybrid states, where cells co-express opposing fate determinants, challenges this model. We hypothesised that oscillatory expression enables co-existence of cross-repressive TFs within single cells, allowing hybrid states in bistable motifs. To test this, we focused on HES1 and HES5, oscillatory, cross-repressive TFs that regulate neural progenitor maintenance and are expressed in adjacent dorsoventral domains in the developing spinal cord. Using live-cell imaging of fluorescent reporters and computational modelling, we show that HES1 and HES5 co-express and oscillate in-phase within single cells. Differences in protein stability result in distinct free-running periodicity, but co-expression results in entrainment and phase-locking. Modulating cross-repression strength and/or abundance shifts the system towards bistability and dominance of a single TF oscillator. Consistent with this, we observe progressive separation of the HES expression domains in vivo, through a decrease in oscillatory co-expression. Our findings provide a mechanism for hybrid states to emerge in a developmental bistable motif.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Here, we investigated the genetic regulation of 18 fatty acids in subcutaneous adipose tissue from 569 female twins from TwinsUK. Using twin models, the heritability of fatty acids ranged from 5% to 59%, indicating a substantial genetic regulation of fatty acid levels within adipose tissue, which was also tissue-specific in many cases. Genome-wide association studies identified ten significant loci, in SCD, ADAMTSL1, ZBTB41, SNTB1, EXOC6B, ACSL3, LINC02055, MKRN2/TSEN2, FADS1 and HAPLN across 13 fatty acids or fatty acid product-to-precursor ratios. Using adipose gene expression and methylation, which were concurrently measured in these samples, we detected five fatty acid-associated signals that colocalized with eQTL and meQTL signals, highlighting fatty acids that are regulated by molecular processes within adipose tissue. We identified strong associations of adipose fatty acids-associated loci with type 2 diabetes, body fat percentage, and cardiovascular disease. We explored links between polygenic scores of common metabolic traits and adipose fatty acid levels, and identified associations between polygenic scores of BMI, body-fat distribution and triglycerides and several fatty acids, indicating these risk scores impact local adipose tissue content.

In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB. These results suggest that accounting for phylogenetic and sampling biases is essential to realizing the full potential of large sequence models in variant effect prediction.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

However, functional alteration along the sensory-association axis is associated with worse cognition throughout the AD spectrum, and even in older adults without AD pathology, suggesting that these FC patterns may reflect a general neural response to cognitive strain. Independently of AD, older age was associated with alterations instead along the executive-nonexecutive axis, a finding that was consistent throughout the adult lifespan. These findings highlight the fundamental role of intrinsic functional organization in shaping how the brain responds to aging and to AD, helping to resolve previously reported discrepancies.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Epistasis shapes this evolution, as an antigenic mutation that is deleterious in one genetic background may become tolerated in another. However, the extent to which epistasis can alleviate pleiotropic conflicts between immune escape and protein function/stability is unclear. Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has enabled emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HAs cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HAs stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature. Our results refine our understanding of the mutational constraints that shape influenza evolution: epistasis can enable antigenic change, but pleiotropic effects can restrict its trajectory.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

In this work, we extend Mumemto by introducing two new partitioning and merging strategies. Both strategies enable highly parallel, memory efficient, and updateable computation of multi-MUMs. One of the strategies, called string-based merging, is also capable of conducting the merges in a way that follows the shape of a phylogenetic tree, naturally yielding the multi-MUM for the trees internal nodes as well as the root. With these strategies, Mumemto now scales to 474 human haplo-types, the only multi-MUM method able to do so.

Trypanosoma brucei expresses a single Variant-Surface-Glycoprotein (VSG) from a large genetic repertoire, which they periodically switch throughout an infection. Co-transcribed with the active-VSG within a specialised nuclear body are expression-site-associated-genes (ESAGs), involved in important host-parasite interactions, including protecting the parasite from human serum lytic effects, modulating the hosts innate immune response and uptake of essential nutrients. Despite expression within the same polycistron, there is a significant differential expression between ESAGs and VSGs (>140-fold), however, the regulatory mechanism has remained elusive for decades. Here, using a combination of genetic tools, super resolution microscopy, proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we identified three novel proteins, which are recruited in a hierarchical manner, forming discreet sub-nuclear condensates that are developmentally regulated and negatively regulate ESAG transcripts. Among them, Expression-Site-Body-specific-protein-2 (ESB2) contains a nuclease domain that shares structural similarity to the endonuclease domain found in SMG6, a critical component of nonsense mediated decay in mammals. Mutation of key residues required for the nuclease activity impaired ESB2 localisation and function.

A recent discovery of a multi-subunit insertase in eukaryotes has raised the question about the architecture of the putative bacterial ortholog SecYEG-YidC and its functional mechanism. Here, we combine cryogenic electron microscopy with cell-free protein synthesis in nanodiscs to visualize biogenesis of the polytopic membrane protein NuoK, the subunit K of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, that requires both SecYEG and YidC for insertion. We demonstrate that YidC is recruited to the back of the translocon at the late stage of the substrate insertion, in resemblance to the eukaryotic system, and in vivo experiments indicate that the complex assembly is vital for the cells. The nascent chain does not utilize the lateral gate of SecYEG, but enters the lipid membrane at the SecYE-YidC interface, with YidC being the primary insertase. SecYEG-YidC complex promotes folding of the nascent helices at the interface prior their insertion, so the examined cellular pathway follows the fundamental thermodynamic principles of membrane protein folding.

Here, we combined high-resolution diffusion MRI tractography from 208 term-born neonates with spatially resolved prenatal gene expression data to investigate the molecular correlates of network hub formation at mid-gestation. We identified robust hub architecture in the neonatal connectome and mapped these structural hubs to corresponding cortical regions in the Brain prenatal digital brain atlas.

Here, utilizing Pseudomonas entomophila intestinal infection in Drosophila, we demonstrated that sex differences in intestinal redox processes contribute to female bias in susceptibility to gut infection. Female inability to overcome excessive pathogen-induced oxidative stress results in defecation blockage, pathogen persistence, and host death. Male flies exhibit increased carbohydrate metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway activity - a key antioxidant defense system. This allows males to withstand oxidative stress-induced defecation blockage and clear the pathogen from the intestine, resulting in survival. Additionally, P. entomophila showed increased expression of several virulence factors, including RNA-binding protein Hfq, in the female gut, contributing to female-biased virulence of P. entomophila. Thus, the effect of the gut metabolic environment on host defenses and pathogen virulence determines the sex differences in intestinal infection outcomes.

HighlightsIntestinal transit of gut pathogen contributes to sexually dimorphic susceptibility to Drosophila gut infection.
Male bias in PPP favors pathogen clearance and recovery post-infection.
P. entomophila reacts differently to female gut environment, where higher levels of Hfq might contribute to virulence/lethality.

However, the extent to which molecular evolution has influenced the isotopic signatures of nitrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to bioavailable ammonia, remains unresolved. Here, we reconstruct and experimentally characterize a library of synthetic ancestral nitrogenase genes, spanning over 2 billion years of evolutionary history. By engineering modern microbes to express these ancient nitrogenases, we assess the resulting {varepsilon}{superscript 1}N values under controlled laboratory conditions. All engineered strains exhibit {varepsilon}15N values within a narrow range comparable to that of modern microbes, suggesting that molybdenum (Mo)-dependent nitrogenase has been largely invariant throughout evolutionary time since the origins of this pathway.

We found that while reward-related dopamine signals were broadly distributed, responses to aversive events were region-specific, enabling classification of projection targets from these dopamine dynamics. By using dimensionality reduction to examine the main axis of covariance of dopamine release across the brain, we found that reward prediction error signals are encoded by parallel manifolds, whereas aversive stimulus signals are encoded by orthogonal manifolds.

We demonstrate that -mycolic acids adopt extended conformations to stabilize bilayers, with a phase transition near 338 K that underscores their thermal resilience. Lipids in the outer leaflet such as PDIM and PAT induce membrane heterogeneity, migrating to the interleaflet space and reducing lipid order. The simulated mycobacterial outer membrane has ordered inner leaflets and disordered outer leaflets, which contrasts with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

Here, we present StringTie3, a major update to the widely used StringTie assembler, specifically designed for total RNA-seq. This new version introduces two key innovations: (1) a nascent mode that models co-transcriptional splicing to separate nascent from mature transcripts, and (2) a refined long-read module that distinguishes genuine polyadenylation sites from poly(A)-priming artifacts. Across short-, long-, and hybrid-read datasets, StringTie3 substantially reduces assembly errors and outperforms existing tools, boosting precision by up to 20% in short-read total RNA-seq and improving sensitivity and precision by as much as 37% and 75%, respectively, in long-read assemblies. In Argonaute knockout experiments, nascent-mode analysis shows that single knockouts predominantly alter nascent transcripts while leaving mature RNA largely unchanged, whereas double or triple knockouts disrupt both fractions. Applying this approach to breast cancer samples shows that, although nascent and mature RNA levels often correlate, certain extracellular matrix and tumor suppressor genes deviate from this pattern, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation. By accurately reconstructing transcriptomes and distinguishing nascent from mature RNA, StringTie3 reveals hidden layers of RNA regulation and provides a powerful framework for investigating transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes in total RNA-seq data.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

This process is known as background selection. However, the impact of background selection has been studied almost exclusively without reference to its effect on phenotypic variation. Here, we use population genetic theory and simulation to investigate the consequences of background selection for linked variation impacting complex traits. We find the impact of background selection on a complex trait depends on the type of selection acting on the trait, the effect size distribution, and the background selection intensity. For instance, background selection impacts a much broader range of effect sizes for traits under directional selection via a liability threshold mechanism (i.e. when selection acts on individuals with phenotypes exceeding a threshold) than when fitness decays exponentially with trait value. We also find that background selection can increase the population prevalence of a liability threshold trait (e.g. a complex binary disease trait). Furthermore, while background selection can only reduce the genetic variance of a trait under directional selection (as might be expected from the classical population genetic theory for linked neutral variants) we find that background selection can increase the genetic variance of a trait under stabilizing selection. The results presented here use a synthesis of population genetic and quantitative genetic modeling, and overall, have relevance for understand the genetic architecture and evolution of complex traits, including complex diseases.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Despite this, little is known regarding the global epidemiology of IMP carbapenemases.

MethodsWe comprehensively identified blaIMP genes in all publicly available bacterial genomes, then systematically analysed the distribution of variants across species, lineages, plasmids and mobile elements, examining patterns over time, across geographic regions and by source. Structural analysis of IMP variants was performed.

Findings4,556 blaIMP-containing genomes were identified from 1996-2023, including 52 blaIMP variants across 93 bacterial species. Key variants (blaIMP-1, blaIMP-4, blaIMP-7, blaIMP-8 and blaIMP-13) achieved global endemicity, while blaIMP-26 and blaIMP-27 were regionally endemic in Southeast Asia and North America, respectively. blaIMP dissemination was driven by horizontal gene transfer, facilitating inter-species spread. Proliferation of multidrug-resistant Enterobacter hormaechei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae lineages led to local outbreaks. Dereplication removed 3,175/4,556 (69.9%) genomes, indicating that most blaIMP-containing genomes were highly related. blaIMP variants were associated with mobile genetic element combinations including class 1 integrons and insertion sequences (99.7%), aiding mobilisation into [&ge;]52 plasmid clusters, predominantly IncHI2A, IncN, IncL/M and IncC. Genomes of environmental and animal origin accounted for 10.0% and 1.1% of the dataset, respectively. Evidence of cross-source transmission was limited, with most spillover occurring between genomes of human and environmental origin. Structural analysis revealed a conserved carbapenemase structure (mean lDDT 0.977), with convergent missense mutations at seven catalytically relevant sites.

InterpretationGlobal analysis enabled us to historically reconstruct the emergence and variant-specific epidemiologies of blaIMP carbapenemase genes. Intersecting mobile elements enabled blaIMP genes to spread across multiple plasmids and bacterial genera, facilitating global and multi-source spread within a One Health framework. Additionally, convergent evolutionary patterns indicate that IMP variants may continue evolving, potentially evading novel beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.

Research in context panelO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDespite being a major cause of carbapenem resistance in Gram negative infections, little is known about the global epidemiology of IMP carbapenemases. IMP carbapenemases are metallo-beta-lactamases that were first identified in 1991 and have evolved into 96 different IMP variants. On May 21 2025, we searched all published reports available in PubMed using the terms ""IMP and  carbapenemase genomics NOT (Review[Publication Type]) NOT (Case Reports[Publication Type]) NOT PCR"" with no language restrictions and no publication date restrictions. We identified 223 articles, 62 and 121 of which reported single species or a single study centre/country, respectively. Only 6 articles employed genomics to examine multi-species and multi-geographical isolates, though this was in the context of carbapenem resistance more broadly rather than IMP carbapenemases specifically. The most relevant study included 38 globally distributed genomes across four species and tracked seven blaIMP variants across mobile genetic elements.

Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this global characterisation provides the most comprehensive account of blaIMP carbapenemase gene epidemiology. To analyse the global distribution and diversity of blaIMP genes, we compiled all available public genome data resulting in a dataset of 4,646 genomes. This has allowed us to identify local, regional and international spread of blaIMP variants and determine the contributions of clonal expansion, plasmid proliferation and co-localised mobile genetic elements. We demonstrated that key blaIMP variants display global (IMP-1, IMP-4, IMP-7, IMP-8 and IMP-13) and regional (IMP-26 within Southeast Asia and IMP-27 within North America) endemicity and that these patterns have been previously unacknowledged, reframing the previous understanding that IMP carbapenemases were largely confined to the Asia-Pacific region. Our observation of convergent evolutionary patterns raise concern that IMP variants may continue to evolve, potentially evading new {beta}-lactam antimicrobials. This analysis has revealed the under-recognised contribution IMP carbapenemases make to global carbapenem resistance.

Implications of all the available evidenceThese findings provide the first comprehensive atlas of blaIMP carbapenemase gene dissemination and underscore the silent global spread of IMP carbapenemases. We note the critical need for enhanced surveillance systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, that can detect complex plasmid-mediated and mobile genetic element-associated spread, as we noted with blaIMP carbapenemase genes. Moreover, our analyses show that systematic sampling across human, animal, and environmental reservoirs is crucial to address the One Health dimensions of emerging antimicrobial resistance threats. The study provides a framework for future interventions aimed at tracking and stopping the spread of IMP carbapenemases and calls for co-ordinated, real-time public health responses to this growing challenge.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600

Virome composition shifted dramatically with life stage, transitioning from low-diversity, temperate-dominated communities in calves to high-diversity, lytic-dominated communities in adults. Virome transitions paralleled but showed distinct dynamics from bacterial community development, with viral and bacterial diversity negatively correlated during drying-off. Dry cows exhibited elevated viral loads relative to their bacterial hosts. We identified 26 viral sequences targeting the methanogen Methanobrevibacter, absent in calves but present in adults. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of ruminant gut viral communities and highlight phages potential regulatory role during critical life transitions.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying eIF2As function remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit a TurboID-based proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry to systematically map the interactome of eIF2A during homeostasis and stress. Combining polysome gradients with TurboID, we zoom into the interactions of eIF2A with the 40S small ribosomal subunit and map the eIF2A binding site close to the mRNA entry channel. We identify a network of interactors that link eIF2A to ribosome-associated quality control, including its strong interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes as well as RPS2 and RPS3. In the absence of eIF2A, RPS2 and RPS3 ubiquitination is diminished specifically upon ribosome stalling. 40S-specific footprinting in eIF2A knockout cells shows minimal changes in 5UTR occupancy, consistent with a limited role for eIF2A in translation initiation. Using dynamic SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterize the novel function of eIF2A in ribosome-associated quality control and show that eIF2A antagonizes USP10-dependent rescue of 40S ribosomes, resulting in altered turnover of 40S subunits upon cellular stress. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown link between eIF2A and ribosome-associated quality control, implies that eIF2A promotes translation fidelity by tuning 40S ribosome rescue under stress and warrants further investigations into the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Comparative genomic analysis suggests that some strains need to be assigned to novel taxa or reclassified. Functional gene survey indicates that some strains possess previously unrecognized potential for carbon fixation or bioactive secondary metabolite production.

Here, we present the deepest sequence coverage screen of the bacterial N-degron pathway using combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Our results reveal new categories of exceptions and nuance to the N-degron pathway observed in bulk and context-specific analyses. For example, we find cases where penultimate residues can reinforce or shift the stability expected based only on the identity of position 1 (P1). We observe lowered stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in bulky residues and Gln as well as heightened stability for P2-P5 motifs rich in negatively charged residues, Gly, and Pro, particularly when these residues are at P2. We find that P1 Cys can be a component of an N-degron in a sequence-specific manner. Furthermore, we employ machine learning to predict protein stability, identifying several motifs with unexpected fates. Our work expands the sequence determinants of the bacterial N-degron pathway with unprecedented granularity, providing a set of sequence guidelines for proteomic investigation and protein engineering.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was mosaic with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as inter-individual heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.","NA","biorxiv",1748642996600

DesignSystematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sourcesPubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and SportDiscus databases were searched in June 2024, supplemented by manual citation reviews.

Eligibility criteriaInclusion criteria comprised studies of transgender individuals comparing physical fitness/body composition pre-to-post gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or vs. cisgender controls, with quantitative outcomes reported.

ResultsFifty-one studies (6,434 participants) were analyzed. Transgender women (TW) exhibited comparable fat mass to cisgender women (CW), but higher than cisgender men (CM). TW showed greater lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper- and lower-body strength were similar between TW and CW, but lower than CM. TW and CW had similar VO2 peak, but TW exhibited lower values than CM. Transgender men (TM) exhibited similar fat mass to CW, but higher than CM. TM showed higher lean mass than CW, but lower than CM. Upper-body strength was higher in TM than CW, but lower than CM. GAHT in TW increased fat mass, reduced lean mass and upper-body strength, with no differences in lower-body strength over 1-3 years. TM demonstrated reduced fat mass and increased lean mass, upper- and lower-body strength post-GAHT. Risk of bias was moderate for most studies, with limited observations for specific outcomes (e.g., VO2 peak).

ConclusionWhile TW exhibited higher lean mass than CW, their physical fitness was comparable. Current evidence is limited but does not justify blanket bans based on assumptions of inherent athletic advantages for TW over CW.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICO_LIThe inclusion of transgender women in female sports categories remains a highly contentious subject.
C_LIO_LIExisting studies suggest that gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) alters body composition in transgender individuals, but evidence on functional performance outcomes (e.g., strength, endurance) remains inconsistent.
C_LIO_LIPolicies advocating blanket bans on transgender women (TW) in female sports often cite residual advantages from prior testosterone exposure, despite limited empirical support for sustained performance disparities post-GAHT.
C_LI

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS?O_LIThis systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data from 51 studies (6,434 participants), demonstrating that, while TW showed higher absolute lean mass than cisgender women (CW), there are no significant differences in upper/lower-body strength or VO{square}peak after 1-3 years of GAHT.
C_LIO_LIThese findings challenge the validity of blanket bans predicated on assumptions of inherent athletic superiority of TW over CW.
C_LIO_LITransgender men (TM) exhibit body composition and strength metrics intermediate between CW and cisgender men (CM) post-GAHT.
C_LIO_LICritical research gaps are identified, including a lack of long-term GAHT data, underrepresentation of transgender athletes, and inconsistent controls for confounders (e.g., training history, puberty blocking). Future studies must prioritize sport-specific performance metrics and longitudinal designs to inform equitable policies.

This study investigates structural and functional alterations in the brainstem and cerebellar peduncles of individuals with PCS using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and volumetric analysis. Forty-four PCS patients (15 bedridden) and 14 healthy controls underwent neuroimaging. Volumetric analysis focused on 22 brainstem regions, including the superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and midbrain reticular formation (mRt).

Significant volume reductions were observed in the SCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 3.31) and MCP (p < .001, Hedges g = 1.77), alongside decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the MCP, indicative of impaired white matter integrity. FA_Avg fractional anisotropy average tested by FreeSurfer Tracula, is an index of white matter integrity, reflecting axonal fiber density, axonal diameter and myelination. These neuroimaging findings correlated with clinical manifestations of motor incoordination, proprioceptive deficits, and autonomic instability. Furthermore, volume loss in the dorsal raphe (DR) and midbrain reticular formation suggests disruption of pain modulation and sleep-wake cycles, consistent with patient-reported symptoms.

Post-mortem studies provide supporting evidence for brainstem involvement in COVID-19. Radtke et al. (2024) reported activation of intracellular signaling pathways and release of immune mediators in brainstem regions of deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting an attempt to inhibit viral spread. While viral genetic material was detectable, infected neurons were not observed. Matschke et al. (2020) found that microglial activation and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration were predominantly localized to the brainstem and cerebellum, with limited involvement of the frontal lobe. This aligns with clinical observations implicating the brainstem in PCS pathophysiology. Cell-specific expression analysis of genes contributing to viral entry (ACE2, TMPRSS2, TPCN2, TMPRSS4, NRP1, CTSL) in the cerebral cortex showed their presence in neurons, glial cells, and endothelial cells, indicating the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cell types. Associations with autoimmune diseases with specific autoantibodies, including beta-2 and M-2 against G-protein coupled alpha-1, beta-1, beta-2 adrenoceptors against angiotensin II type 1 receptor or M1,2,3-mAChR, among others, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) are known (Blitshteyn et al. 2015 and Wallukat and Schminke et al. 2014).

These findings support the ""Broken Bridge Syndrome"" hypothesis, positing that structural disconnections between the brainstem and cerebellum contribute to PCS symptomatology. Furthermore, we propose that chronic activation of the Extended Autonomic System (EAS), encompassing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system, may perpetuate these symptoms (Goldstein, 2020). Perturbations in this system may relate to the elevation of toxic autoantibodies AABs (Beta-2 and M-2), specific epitopes of the COVID viruss SPIKE protein and Cytokine storm of IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in their increased numbers (1,000->10,000)

Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neuroinflammatory mechanisms, EAS dysregulation, and potential therapeutic interventions for PCS.","NA","medrxiv",1748642996600
