MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

Here, we sequenced and analyzed 382 full-length OROV genomes from human samples collected between 2022 and 2024 from all four states, aiming to trace the origin and genetic evolution of OROV leading to the current outbreak. Genomic analyses revealed that the recent upsurge of OROV cases in the Brazilian Amazon region coincides with the emergence of a novel reassortant viral lineage containing the M segment of viruses detected in the eastern Amazon region from 2009 to 2018 and the L and S segments of viruses detected in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador from 2008 to 2021. The novel reassortant OROV lineage likely emerged in the Central region of the AM state between 2010 and 2014 and displayed a long-range silent dispersion during the second half of the 2010s. The 2022-2024 OROV epidemic was spatially segregated into three major subpopulations located in RR, AMACRO (a bordering region between AC, RO, and AM-Southern region), and AM-Central (which includes the Amazonas capital, Manaus) regions. The peak of OROV transmissions in all regions occurred during the rainy season in the Amazon basin. Furthermore, our phylodynamics reconstructions showed that OROV spread was driven mainly by short-range (< 2 km) movements, with an average dispersal rate [&le;] 1.2 km/day, consistent with the pattern of an active flight of infected vectors. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion (22%) of long-range (> 10 km) OROV migrations were also detected, consistent with viral dispersion via human activities. Our data provides an unprecedented view of the real-time spread and evolution of a neglected emergent human pathogen. Moreover, our results emphasize the need for widespread, long-term genomic surveillance to better understand the real burden of OROV within and beyond the Amazon region.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

There is limited understanding of factors that influence their biodistribution and immunogenicity. Antibodies to polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is on the surface of the lipid nanoparticle, are detectable in humans and boosted by human mRNA vaccination. We hypothesized that PEG-specific antibodies could increase the clearance of mRNA vaccines. We developed methods to quantify both the mRNA and ionizable lipid in frequent serial blood samples from 19 subjects receiving Moderna SPIKEVAX mRNA booster immunization. Both the mRNA and ionizable lipid peaked in blood 1-2 days post vaccination (median peak level 0.19 and 3.22 ng mL-1, respectively). The mRNA was detectable out to 14-28 days post-vaccination in most subjects. We measured the proportion of mRNA that was relatively intact in blood over time and found the decay kinetics of the intact mRNA and ionizable lipid were identical, suggesting the intact lipid nanoparticle recirculates in blood. However, mRNA and ionizable lipid decay rates did not correlate with baseline levels of PEG-specific nor spike-specific antibodies. The magnitude of mRNA and ionizable lipid detected in blood did correlate with the boost in PEG antibodies. Further, the ability of subjects monocytes to phagocytose lipid nanoparticles had an inverse relationship with the rise in PEG antibodies. This suggests circulation of mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccines into the blood and their ability to be cleared by phagocytes influence PEG immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines. Overall, this work defines the pharmacokinetics of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccine components in human blood after intramuscular injection and the factors that influence this. These insights should prove useful in improving the future safety and efficacy of lipid nanoparticle mRNA vaccines and therapeutics.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

We assessed the safety and effectiveness of first and second dose BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents in England.

MethodsWith the approval of NHS England, we conducted an observational study in the OpenSAFELY-TPP database, including a) adolescents aged 12-15 years, and b) children aged 5-11 years and comparing individuals receiving i) first vaccination with unvaccinated controls and ii) second vaccination to single-vaccinated controls. We matched vaccinated individuals with controls on age, sex, region, and other important characteristics. Outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 test (adolescents only); COVID-19 A&E attendance; COVID-19 hospitalisation; COVID-19 critical care admission; COVID-19 death, with non-COVID-19 death and fractures as negative control outcomes and A&E attendance, unplanned hospitalisation, pericarditis, and myocarditis as safety outcomes.

ResultsAmongst 820,926 previously unvaccinated adolescents, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test comparing vaccination with no vaccination was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.75), although the 20-week risks were similar. The IRRs were 0.60 (0.37-0.97) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.58 (0.38-0.89) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.99 (0.93-1.06) for fractures, 0.89 (0.87-0.91) for A&E attendances and 0.88 (0.81-0.95) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 441,858 adolescents who had received first vaccination IRRs comparing second dose with first dose only were 0.67 (0.65-0.69) for positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 1.00 (0.20-4.96) for COVID-19 A&E attendance, 0.60 (0.26-1.37) for COVID-19 hospitalisation, 0.94 (0.84-1.05) for fractures, 0.93 (0.89-0.98) for A&E attendance and 0.99 (0.86-1.13) for unplanned hospitalisation. Amongst 283,422 previously unvaccinated children and 132,462 children who had received a first vaccine dose, COVID-19-related outcomes were too rare to allow IRRs to be estimated precisely. A&E attendance and unplanned hospitalisation were slightly higher after first vaccination (IRRs versus no vaccination 1.05 (1.01-1.10) and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) respectively) but slightly lower after second vaccination (IRRs versus first dose 0.95 (0.86-1.05) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) respectively). There were no COVID-19-related deaths in any group. Fewer than seven (exact number redacted) COVID-19-related critical care admissions occurred in the adolescent first dose vs unvaccinated cohort. Among both adolescents and children, myocarditis and pericarditis were documented only in the vaccinated groups, with rates of 27 and 10 cases/million after first and second doses respectively.

ConclusionBNT162b2 vaccination in adolescents reduced COVID-19 A&E attendance and hospitalisation, although these outcomes were rare. Protection against positive SARS-CoV-2 tests was transient.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

However, other brain regions like the cerebellum and brain stem remain largely intact despite the universal expression of tau throughout the brain. Here, we found that an understudied splice isoform of tau termed ""big tau"" is significantly more abundant in the brain regions less vulnerable to tau pathology compared to tau pathology-vulnerable regions. We used various cellular and animal models to demonstrate that big tau possesses multiple properties that can resist AD-related pathological changes. Importantly, human AD patients show a higher expression level of pathology-resisting big tau in the cerebellum, the brain region spared from tau pathology.

ObjectiveThis cross-sectional study examined the relationships between macronutrients, dietary components, and sleep parameters, considering their interdependencies.

MethodsData from 4,825 users of sleep and nutrition apps for at least 7 days were analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis investigated associations between quartiles of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, including saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats), dietary components (sodium, potassium, dietary fiber, and sodium-to-potassium ratio), and sleep variables (total sleep time [TST], sleep latency [SL], and % wakefulness after sleep onset [%WASO]). Nutrients were divided into quartiles, with the lowest intake group as the reference. Compositional data analysis accounted for interdependencies among macronutrients. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

ResultsHigher protein intake was associated with longer TST in the 3rd (B = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.26) and 4th quartiles (B = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.27).

Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterisation of genes that act at the phage-host interface. To date, this is restricted to few model phage-host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers (ASOs) to silence genes of both DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognised proteins that are essential for phage replication and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is a {Phi}KZ-encoded nuclease that acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. The non-genetic ASO-based gene silencing used here promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage-host pairs, and offers potential for optimising phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Motor behavior, however, is known to degrade across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay. In particular, performance on speed-dependent motor tasks deteriorates, spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) slows, and upper motor rate limit falls. Here, we examine whether this slowdown in motor behavior impacts tempo of musical performance as a function of age. We analyzed 14,556 songs released between 1956 and 2020 by artists with careers spanning at least 20 years. Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) and Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) were employed to assess the effects of age, operationalized by subtracting birth year from release year of each track, on musical tempo. Results revealed a slight tempo increase from early adulthood to age 30, followed by a marked, linear slowdown with age across the remainder of the lifespan. From artists thirties to their eighties, tempo decreased by almost 10 bpm, averaging around 2 bpm per decade. This decrease aligns with the slowing-with-age hypothesis and mirrors rates of decline observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo (SMT) and gait speed.

Moreover, that a discernible decrease in tempo is apparent even in commercial recordings further emphasizes the inescapable connection between dynamics of motor behavior and timing of musical performance.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

This study investigates virological factors contributing to the reemergence of Oropouche fever in Brazil between 2023 and 2024.

MethodsIn this study, we combined OROV genomic, molecular, and serological data from Brazil from 1 January 2015 to 29 June 2024, along with in vitro and in vivo characterization. Molecular screening data included 93 patients with febrile illness between January 2023 and February 2024 from the Amazonas State. Genomic data comprised two genomic OROV sequences from patients. Serological data were obtained from neutralizing antibody tests comparing the prototype OROV strain BeAn 19991 and the 2024 epidemic strain. Epidemiological data included aggregated cases reported to the Brazilian Ministry of Health from 1 January 2014 to 29 June 2024.

FindingsIn 2024, autochthonous OROV infections were detected in previously non-endemic areas across all five Brazilian regions. Cases were reported in 19 of 27 federal units, with 83.2% (6,895 of 8,284) of infections in Northern Brazil and a nearly 200-fold increase in incidence compared to reported cases over the last decade. We detected OROV RNA in 10.8% (10 of 93) of patients with febrile illness between December 2023 and May 2024 in Amazonas. We demonstrate that the 2023-2024 epidemic was caused by a novel OROV reassortant that replicated approximately 100-fold higher titers in mammalian cells compared to the prototype strain. The 2023-2024 OROV reassortant displayed plaques earlier than the prototype, produced 1.7 times more plaques, and plaque sizes were 2.5 larger compared to the prototype. Furthermore, serum collected in 2016 from previously OROV-infected individuals showed at least a 32-fold reduction in neutralizing capacity against the reassortment strain compared to the prototype.

InterpretationThese findings provide a comprehensive assessment of Oropouche fever in Brazil and contribute to a better understanding of the 2023-2024 OROV reemergence. The recent increased incidence may be related to a higher replication efficiency of a new reassortant virus that also evades previous immunity.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

To investigate the basis for species-specific developmental tempo we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of protein dynamics in mouse and human neural progenitors (NPs). Through a combination of targeted protein labelling, quantitative mass spectrometry, and functional genomics, we demonstrate that protein degradation is a key driver of tempo differences between mouse and human NPs. We observe a systematic 1.5-fold increase in protein half-lives in human NPs compared to mouse, independent of cellular compartment or protein function. This difference persists in post-mitotic neurons, indicating active degradation as the primary mechanism. Proteasomal activity is also ~1.5-fold higher in mouse NPs, consistent with upregulation of proteasome-associated proteins. Importantly, increasing the rate of proteolytic degradation of a key transcriptional repressor in neural progenitors accelerates the expression of its target gene. Despite differences in degradation rates, protein synthesis rates are similar between species, resulting in higher protein content in human NPs. Our findings highlight the central role of protein degradation in controlling developmental tempo and provide insight into the molecular basis of evolutionary changes in developmental timing across species.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Here, we demonstrate that the same genetic pathway that creates giant cells in sepals is also responsible for their formation in the leaf epidermis. In both sepals and leaves, giant cells are scattered among smaller cells; therefore, we asked whether the spatial arrangement of giant cells is random. By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues we show that giant cells are clustered more than is expected by chance. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model recapitulates the observed giant cell clustering, indicating that clustering emerges as a result of the cell division pattern. Overall, cell size patterning is developmentally regulated by common mechanisms in leaves and sepals rather than a simple byproduct of cell growth.

However, current deep learning-based DNPD approaches are often limited by their focus on specific or narrowly defined protein designs, restricting broader exploration and the discovery of diverse, functional proteins. To address this issue, we introduce Pinal, a probabilistic sampling method that generates protein sequences using rich natural language as guidance. Unlike end-to-end text-to-sequence generation approaches, we employ a two-stage generative process. Initially, we generate structures based on given language instructions, followed by designing sequences conditioned on both the structure and the language. This approach facilitates searching within the smaller structure space rather than the vast sequence space. Experiments demonstrate that Pinal outperforms existing models, including the concurrent work ESM3, and can generalize to novel protein structures outside the training distribution when provided with appropriate instructions. This work aims to aid the biological community by advancing the design of novel proteins, and our code will be made publicly available soon.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

However, many parameters are challenging to estimate from real-world data, and rely on human challenge studies or mass community testing. During Winter 2023/2024, a community cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted across households in England and Scotland. From this survey, questionnaire data and follow-up testing protocols provided valuable data into multiple epidemiological parameters: namely, the duration of positivity, test sensitivity, and the incubation period. Here, Bayesian statistical modelling methods are developed and applied to estimate the underlying parameters. The duration of LFD positivity is found to increase with increasing age, with a mean of 8.55 days (95% CrI: 7.65 days, 9.44 days) in the youngest age group compared to 10.27 days (95% CrI: 9.85 days, 10.71 days) in the oldest age group. Similarly, test sensitivity, as a function of time since symptom onset, decays fastest in the youngest age group, reaching a minimum sensitivity of 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.16, 0.37) compared to 0.54 (95% CrI: 0.46, 0.6). Such patterns are expected since younger individuals experience less severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are likely to clear the virus faster. Combining the duration of positivity and test sensitivity, we estimate the probability of returning a positive test. Close to symptom onset date, this probability is approximately 95%. However, this rapidly drops off, dropping below 5% after 11.3 days (95% CrI: 9.7 days, 13 days) for the youngest age group and 16.2 days (95% CrI: 15.4 days, 17.1 days) for the oldest age group. For the incubation period, there is no clear pattern by age. Across all age groups, the mean incubation period is 2.52 days (95% CrI: 2.42 days, 2.62 days). This is shorter than the most recent estimates for Omicron BA.5, which is in line with earlier research that found replacing variants had shorter incubation periods.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

Bacteria can evolve de novo resistance against T6SS attacks, but resistance is far from universal in natural communities, suggesting key features of T6SS weaponry may act to limit its evolution. Here, we combine eco-evolutionary modelling and experimental evolution to examine how toxin type and multiplicity in Acinetobacter baylyi attackers shape resistance evolution in susceptible Escherichia coli competitors. In both our models and experiments, we find that combinations of multiple distinct toxins limit resistance evolution by creating genetic bottlenecks, driving resistant lineages extinct before they can reach high frequency. We also show that, paradoxically, single-toxin attackers often drive the evolution of cross-resistance, protecting bacteria against unfamiliar toxin combinations, even though such evolutionary pathways were inaccessible against multi-toxin attackers. Our findings indicate that, comparable to antimicrobial and anticancer combination therapies, multi-toxin T6SS arsenals function to limit resistance evolution in competing microbes. This helps us to understand why T6SSs remain widespread and effective weapons in microbial communities, and why many bacteria T6SS-armed encode functionally diverse anti-competitor toxins.

SignificanceToxin secretion systems, such as T6SSs, are widely used by bacteria to inhibit competing microorganisms. Here, we show that the secretion of multiple toxins in combination can suppress the evolution of resistance to the T6SS, rationalising its continued widespread use across diverse communities. Our work shows that principles of combination therapy--well known in the context of antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer therapies--also apply in the context of microbial warfare, helping to explain why many bacteria maintain diverse T6SS toxin arsenals. Resistance suppression is also a technologically useful property of T6SS toxin cocktails, which could be harnessed as part of future biocontrol or biotherapeutic applications, using live T6SS-armed bacteria to limit the growth of problem microorganisms.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Here, we utilized subcellular-resolution imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (IST) in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses wild-type human -synuclein (-syn-tg) to evaluate patterns of selective neuronal vulnerability to -synuclein pathology. By performing post-IST immunofluorescence for -synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSyn), we identified cell types in the cortex and hippocampus that were vulnerable or resistant to developing pSyn pathology. Next, we investigated the transcriptional underpinnings of the observed selective vulnerability using a set of custom probes to detect genes involved in -synuclein processing and toxicity. We identified expression of the kinase:substrate pair Plk2, which phosphorylates -synuclein at Ser129, and human SNCA (hSNCA), as underlying the selective vulnerability to pSyn pathology. Finally, we performed differential gene expression analysis, comparing non-transgenic cells to pSyn- and pSyn+ -syn- tg cells to reveal gene expression changes downstream of hSNCA overexpression and pSyn pathology, which included pSyn-dependent alterations in mitochondrial and endolysosomal genes.

Using observational data for causal inference raises the problem of confounding variables, those affecting both a causal variable and response of interest. Unmeasured confounders lead to statistical bias, creating spurious correlations and masking true causal relationships. To combat this Omitted Variable Bias, other disciplines have developed rigorous approaches for causal inference from observational data addressing the problems of confounders. We show how Ecologists can harness some of these methods: identifying confounders via causal diagrams, using nested sampling designs, and statistical designs that address omitted variable bias for causal inference. Using a motivating example of warming effects on intertidal snails, we show how current methods in Ecology (e.g., mixed models) produce incorrect inferences, and how methods presented here outperform them, reducing bias and increasing statistical power.

Here, we used experimental evolution to investigate how the SADS-CoV spike protein adapts to human cells and to identify potential variants with increased infectivity. We evolved a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the SADS-CoV spike (rVSV-SADS) in three human cell lines. After ten passages, increased viral replication was observed, and spike mutations were identified by sequencing. Mutations were functionally characterized in terms of viral fitness, spike processing and fusogenicity. Our results thus identify potential human-adaptive mutations in the SADS-CoV spike that may further enhance its zoonotic potential.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Emerging evidence suggests that ether lipids play a significant role in physiology and human health. However, their cellular functions remain largely unknown due to a lack of tools for identifying their subcellular localization and interacting proteins. Here, we address this methodological gap by synthesizing minimally modified bifunctional ether lipid probes by introducing diazirine and alkyne groups. To interrogate the subcellular kinetics of intracellular ether lipid transport in mammalian cells we used a combination of fluorescence imaging, machine learning-assisted image analysis and mathematical modelling. We find that alkyl-linked ether lipids are transported up to twofold faster than vinyl-linked species (plasmalogens), pointing to yet undiscovered cellular lipid transport machinery able to distinguish between linkage types differing by as little as two hydrogen atoms. We find that ether lipid transport predominantly occurs via non-vesicular pathways, with varying contributions from vesicular mechanisms between cell types, hinting at cell type-specific adaptations of the relatively conserved major transport mechanism. Altogether, our results suggest that differential recognition of alkyl- and vinyl ether lipids by lipid transfer proteins contributes to their distinct biological functions. In the future, the probes reported here will enable studying ether lipid biology in much greater detail through identification of interacting proteins and in-depth characterization of intracellular ether lipid dynamics.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Mapping the genetic architecture and discovering variants with pleiotropic effects across metabolites can reveal underlying mechanisms and potential targets for personalized interventions. Methods: We performed univariate and multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the Nightingale panel of 249 circulating plasma metabolic markers, across 207,836 White British UK Biobank participants (mean age 57.4 years, 53.7% female), with replication conducted across 27,509 UK Biobank participants with different ancestries, and 92,661 Estonian Biobank participants (mean age 50.9 years, 65.7% female). We investigated rare variation through whole exome sequencing gene burden tests, quantified genetic architectures through Gaussian mixture modelling, analysed the causal role of body mass index (BMI) through Mendelian randomization, and performed genome-wide interaction analyses with sex. Results: We discovered 14,837 loci (497 unique), with shared and distinct effects on cardiometabolic traits, with high replication rates across populations. The loci explained over 70% of genetic variance for fatty acids. Findings from common and rare variant gene tests converged on lipid homeostasis pathways. There was strong evidence for causal effects of BMI on cholesterol and amino acid levels. We discovered 31 loci interacting with sex, which mapped to genes involved in cholesterol processing, and to cardiometabolic conditions with sex differences in prevalence. Discussion: The findings offer new insights into the genetic architecture of circulating metabolites, revealing novel loci and plausible sex-specific molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism. This improved understanding of the molecular biology of metabolism lays a foundation for personalized prevention and treatment strategies.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

Here, we report the discovery of yet another mode of phosphorylation - protein oligophosphorylation. Using site-specifically phosphorylated and pyrophosphorylated nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NME1), the effects of these modifications on enzyme activity were investigated. Phosphorylation, and more so pyrophosphorylation, on threonine 94 notably reduced the nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity. Nevertheless, both phosphoprotein and pyrophosphoprotein were able to catalyze their own oligophosphorylation - up to the formation of a hexaphosphate chain - using ATP as a co-factor. This reaction was critically dependent on the catalytic histidine residue H118, and cryo-EM analysis of the differently modified proteins suggests an intramolecular phosphoryl transfer, likely via a phosphohistidine intermediate. Oligophosphorylation of NME1 in biochemical samples, as well as cell lysates, was further confirmed using mass spectrometry, and oligophophorylation promoted a new set of protein interactions. Our results highlight the complex nature of phosphoregulation, and the methods described here provide the opportunity to investigate the impact of this novel modification in the future.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Most mammals are susceptible to progressive age-related hearing loss; however, the evolution of biosonar, which requires the ability to hear low-intensity echoes from outgoing sonar signals, may have selected against the development of hearing deficits in echolocating bats. Although many echolocating bats exhibit exceptional longevity and rely on acoustic behaviors for survival to old age, relatively little is known about the aging bat auditory system. In this study, we used DNA methylation to estimate the ages of wild-caught big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and measured hearing sensitivity in young and aging bats using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). We found no evidence for hearing deficits in aging bats, demonstrated by comparable thresholds and similar ABR wave and DPOAE amplitudes across age groups. We additionally found no significant histological evidence for cochlear aging, with similar hair cell counts, afferent, and efferent innervation patterns in young and aging bats. Here we demonstrate that big brown bats show minimal evidence for age-related loss of peripheral hearing sensitivity and therefore represent informative models for investigating mechanisms that may preserve hearing function over a long lifetime.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

While regeneration-specific genes conserved in highly regenerative organisms may confer regenerative abilities and long-term maintenance of tissue homeostasis, it remains unclear whether introducing these regenerative genes into low regenerative animals can improve their regeneration and aging processes.

ResultsHere we ectopically express high regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs) in Drosophila, a widely used low regenerative model organism. Surprisingly, HRJD expression impedes tissue regeneration in the developing wing disc but extends organismal lifespan when expressed in the intestinal stem cell lineages of the adult midgut under non-regenerative conditions. Notably, HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions.

ConclusionsThese findings together suggest that the introduction of highly regenerative species-specific genes can improve stem cell functions and promote a healthy lifespan when expressed in aging animals.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Despite their significance in understanding the history of life on Earth, any interpretation of the nature of these microfossils has been a point of contention among researchers. Decades of back-and-forth arguments led to the consensus that reconstructing the lifecycles of Archaean Eon organisms is the only way of understanding the nature of these microfossils. Here, we transformed a Gram-positive bacterium into a primitive lipid vesicle-like state and studied it under environmental conditions prevalent on early Earth. Using this approach, we successfully reconstructed morphologies and life cycles of Archaean microfossils. In addition to reproducing microfossil morphologies, we conducted experiments that spanned years to understand the process of cell degradation and how Archaean cells could have undergone encrustation minerals (in this case, salt), leading to their preservation as fossilized organic carbon in the rock record. These degradation products strongly resemble fossiliferous features from Archaean rock formations. Our observations suggest that microfossils aged between 3.8 to 2.5Ga most likely were liposome-like protocells that have evolved physiological pathways of energy conservation but not the mechanisms to regulate their morphology. Based on these observations, we propose that morphology is not a reliable indicator of taxonomy in these microfossils.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

However, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive with conventional neuroimaging. Recent advances in MRI hardware and new biophysical models of tissue informed by diffusion MRI data hold promise for identifying the cellular changes driving these morphological observations. This study used ultra-strong gradient MRI to obtain high-resolution, in vivo estimates of cortical neurite and soma microstructure in sample of typically developing children and adolescents. Cortical neurite signal fraction, attributed to neuronal and glial processes, increased with age (mean R2fneurite=.53, p<3.3e-11, 11.91% increase over age), while apparent soma radius decreased (mean R2Rsoma=.48, p<4.4e-10, 1% decrease over age) across domain-specific networks. To complement these findings, developmental patterns of cortical gene expression in two independent post-mortem databases were analysed. This revealed increased expression of genes expressed in oligodendrocytes, and excitatory neurons, alongside a relative decrease in expression of genes expressed in astrocyte, microglia and endothelial cell-types. Age-related genes were significantly enriched in cortical oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitors and Layer 5-6 neurons (pFDR<.001) and prominently expressed in adolescence and young adulthood. The spatial and temporal alignment of oligodendrocyte cell-type gene expression with neurite and soma microstructural changes suggest that ongoing cortical myelination processes contribute to adolescent cortical development.

To systematically explore the consequences of Bri2 C-terminal extension, here, we measure amyloid formation for 676 ADan substitutions and identify the region that forms the putative amyloid core of ADan fibrils, located between positions 20 and 26, where stop-loss occurs. Moreover, we measure amyloid formation for ~18,000 random C-terminal extensions of Bri2 and find that ~32% of these sequences can nucleate amyloids. We find that the amino acid composition of these nucleating sequences varies with peptide length and that short extensions of 2 specific amino acids (Aliphatics, Aromatics and Cysteines) are sufficient to generate novel amyloid cores. Overall, our results show that the C-terminus of Bri2 contains an incomplete amyloid motif that can turn amyloidogenic upon extension. C-terminal extension with de novo formation of amyloid motifs may thus be a widespread pathogenic mechanism resulting from stop-loss, highlighting the importance of determining the impact of these mutations for other sequences across the genome.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Many cellular responses during epileptogenesis are also common hallmarks of cellular senescence, which halts proliferation of damaged cells. Clearing senescent cells (SCs) restores function in several age-associated and neurodegenerative disease models. It is unknown whether SC accumulation contributes to epileptogenesis and associated cognitive impairments. To address this question, we used a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and characterized the senescence phenotype throughout epileptogenesis. SCs accumulated 2 weeks after SE and were predominantly microglia. We ablated SCs and reduced (and in some cases prevented) the emergence of spontaneous seizures and normalized cognitive function in mice. Suggesting that this is a translationally-relevant target we also found SC accumulation in resected hippocampi from patients with TLE. These findings indicate that SC ablation after an epileptogenic insult is a potential anti-epileptogenic therapy.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

However, the unique visual diets individuals are exposed to across their lifetimes should sculpt very personal notions of typicality. Here, we thus investigated whether scenes that are more typical to individual observers are more accurately perceived and represented in the brain. We used drawings to enable participants to describe typical scenes (e.g., a kitchen) and converted these drawings into 3D renders. These renders were used as stimuli in a scene categorization task, during which we recorded EEG. In line with previous findings, categorization was most accurate for renders resembling the typical scene drawings of individual participants. Our EEG analyses reveal two critical insights on how these individual differences emerge on the neural level: First, personally typical scenes yielded enhanced neural representations from around 200 ms after onset. Second, personally typical scenes were represented in idiosyncratic ways, with reduced dependence on high-level visual features. We interpret these findings in a predictive processing framework, where individual differences in internal models of scene categories formed through experience shape visual analysis in idiosyncratic ways.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

An obstacle to predicting, monitoring and understanding the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy cachexia is that each cancer (and sub-type) is assigned different chemotherapeutic compounds, typically in multi-agent regimens. Here, we investigate the chemotherapy induction regimen (CIR) used in haematological cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We hypothesized that the AML CIR would induce cachexia, including loss of lean tissue mass and skeletal muscle atrophy.

MethodsUsing an unbiased proteomics approach we interrogated the underlying molecular mechanisms. 3-month-old male Balb/c mice were treated with the AML CIR via intraperitoneal injections of daunorubicin (1.7 mg/kg) on days 1-3, and cytarabine (33.2 mg/kg) administered on days 1-7 or vehicle. Mice were assessed 24 hours after the last treatment, on day 8, or allowed to recover for 2 weeks and assessed on day 22. A third cohort were given access to running wheels in cages. We assessed body composition, whole body metabolism and assessed the muscle proteome using quantitative tandem mass tag labelling LC-MS/MS analysis.

ResultsThe AML CIR induced acute cachexia involving a [~]13% loss of body mass, [~]9% loss of lean mass and [~]10% reduction in skeletal muscle fibre size. Whole body metabolism and ambulatory activity declined. This cachexic phenotype did not recover over the 2-week post-CIR period (lean mass loss post-CIR: 1-week [~]7% vs 2-weeks [~]9%). In voluntarily active CIR-treated mice, body wasting was exacerbated due to unchecked loss of fat mass (CIR sedentary: [~]31% vs CIR active: [~]51%). Muscle proteome studies revealed upregulation of haptoglobin (Hp) and glutamine synthetase (Glul), which were positively correlated with body and lean mass loss. Hp was sensitive to the conditional induction, recovery and exacerbation of AML CIR-mediated cachexia, suggestive of biomarker potential.

ConclusionsThe AML CIR induces an acute reduction of body, lean and fat mass underpinned by skeletal muscle atrophy, hypermetabolism and catabolism. Our data uncovered a conditionally sensitive muscle biomarker in Hp, which may be useful as a prognostic tool across other scenarios of chemotherapy-induced myopathy and cachexia or as a target for therapeutic discovery in follow up studies.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

MethodsPTSD/MDD patients were randomized (N=51) to a two-condition sequence in a two period cross-over design. For the first condition, patients were randomized to 10-session rTMS treatment to either a subgenual cingulate (sgACC) functional connectivity cortical target (fMRI-guided) or standard scalp-based target. Additionally, patients were randomized to either watch a nature video or perform a demanding cognitive task with rTMS administration. Patients crossed over to the two conditions not received in period one. rTMS was delivered in an intermittent theta burst (iTBS) pattern with 2400 pulses per session. Among N=49 patients analyzed, 60% identified as female and average age was 34.

ResultsCompared with the scalp-based target, fMRI-guided rTMS was superior in improving depression symptoms (F(1,43.92)=5.933, p=0.019) as well as PTSD hyperarousal (F(1,40.78)=5.076, p=0.030). The median level of symptom change for fMRI-guided targets exceeded 60% improvement across both scales. Symptom improvements at 6-mo follow-up were durable and both favored fMRI-guidance. For patients reporting symptoms at this timepoint, depression improved by 70% (N13); the PCL improved by 69% with Hyperarousal (N14) and Avoidance (N12) subscales improving by 78% and 79%, respectively, for the fMRI-guided target.

ConclusionsWe demonstrated preliminary evidence for the clinical superiority of a new fMRI-guided target which should be followed up with larger comparative effectiveness studies that include imaging and clinical outcomes.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

In this context, molecular docking approaches are of undoubted importance as complementary approaches to experiments. In this study, we show how HADDOCK can be efficiently used for the prediction of protein-glycan complexes.

During these times, the state of the brain should change rapidly, or reset, to ensure that the information encountered before and after an event boundary is encoded in different neuronal populations. Norepinephrine (NE) is thought to facilitate this network reorganization. However, it is unknown whether event boundaries drive NE release in the hippocampus and, if so, how NE release relates to changes in hippocampal firing patterns. The advent of the new GRABNE sensor now allows for the measurement of NE binding with sub-second resolution. Using this tool in mice, we tested whether NE is released into the dorsal hippocampus during event boundaries defined by unexpected transitions between spatial contexts and presentations of novel objections. We found that NE binding dynamics were well explained by the time elapsed after each of these environmental changes, and were not related to conditioned behaviors, exploratory bouts of movement, or reward. Familiarity with a spatial context accelerated the rate in which phasic NE binding decayed to baseline. Knowing when NE is elevated, we tested how hippocampal coding of space differs during these moments. Immediately after context transitions we observed relatively unique patterns of neural spiking which settled into a modal state at a similar rate in which NE returned to baseline. These results are consistent with a model wherein NE release drives hippocampal representations away from a steady-state attractor. We hypothesize that the distinctive neural codes observed after each event boundary may facilitate long-term memory and contribute to the neural basis for the primacy effect.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Here, we investigate the nature of representations underlying object recognition in older compared to younger adults by tracking them in time using EEG, across space using fMRI, and by probing their behavioral relevance using similarity judgements. Applying a multivariate analysis framework to combine experimental assessments, four key findings about how brain aging impacts object recognition emerge. First, aging selectively delays the formation of object representations, profoundly changing the chronometry of visual processing. Second, the delay in the formation of object representations emerges in high-level rather than low- and mid-level ventral visual cortex, supporting the theory that brain areas developing last deteriorate first. Third, aging reduces content selectivity in high-level ventral visual cortex, indicating age-related neural dedifferentiation as the mechanism of representational change. Finally, we demonstrate that the identified representations of the aging brain are behaviorally relevant, ascertaining ecological relevance. Together, our results reveal the impact of healthy aging on the visual brain.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

The low abundance of HLA-I peptides poses significant technical challenges for their identification and accurate quantification. While mass spectrometry (MS) is currently a method of choice for direct system-wide identification of cellular immunopeptidome, there is still a need for enhanced sensitivity in detecting and quantifying tumor specific epitopes. As gas phase separation in data-dependent MS data acquisition (DDA) increased HLA-I peptide detection by up to 50%, here, we aimed to evaluate the performance of data-independent acquisition (DIA) in combination with ion mobility (diaPASEF) for high-sensitivity identification of HLA presented peptides. Our streamlined diaPASEF workflow enabled identification of 11,412 unique peptides from 12.5 million A375 cells and 3,426 8-11mers from as low as 500,000 cells with high reproducibility. By taking advantage of HLA binder-specific in-silico predicted spectral libraries, we were able to further increase the number of identified HLA-I peptides. We applied SILAC-DIA to a mixture of labeled HLA-I peptides, calculated heavy-to-light ratios for 7,742 peptides across 5 conditions and demonstrated that diaPASEF achieves high quantitative accuracy up to 4-fold dilution. Finally, we identified and quantified shared neoantigens in a monoallelic C1R cell line model. By spiking in heavy synthetic peptides, we verified the identification of the peptide sequences and calculated relative abundances for 13 neoantigens. Taken together, diaPASEF analysis workflows for HLA-I peptides can increase the peptidome coverage for lower sample amounts. The sensitivity and quantitative precision provided by DIA can enable the detection and quantification of less abundant peptide species such as neoantigens across samples from the same background.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

To test this hypothesis, we conducted three behavioural experiments. First, we illuminated beaches near a breeding colony to determine whether more fledglings would become stranded in illuminated versus dark conditions. Next, we conducted a Y-maze experiment to test stranded fledglings for phototactic behaviour in general and for preferences among High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Warm White Light-Emitting Diode (LED), Cool White LED, Blue LED, and Orange LED light. Lastly, we quantified activity levels of stranded fledglings in an open field test during exposure to several different light types. We found significantly more fledglings stranded when beaches were illuminated, and fledglings significantly preferred light over darkness in the Y-maze, supporting our hypothesis that Atlantic Puffin fledglings become stranded due to light attraction. Fledglings displayed no preferences for certain light types over others in the Y-maze, potentially suggesting that strandings in this species may not be mitigable by changing the streetlight type in stranding-prone towns. Interestingly, fledglings exhibited higher activity levels in darkness and HPS light than in LED light, potentially holding implications for rescue, rehabilitation, and husbandry programs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the only evidence-based strategy for the reduction of Atlantic Puffin strandings remains to be the reduction of coastal artificial lighting; however, further research is needed to determine if aspects of artificial light besides bulb type may be altered to effectively reduce light attraction in this species.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

This shortcoming increases the rate of false positives and false negatives, giving rise to a potentially misleading scientific record. To address this shortcoming, many researchers now use point-and-click software to run sample size calculations.

ObjectiveWe aimed to (1) estimate how many published articles report using the G*Power sample size calculation software; (2) assess whether these calculations are reproducible and (3) error-free; and (4) assess how often these calculations use G*Powers default option for mixed-design ANOVAs--which can be misleading and output sample sizes that are too small for a researchers intended purpose.

MethodWe randomly sampled open access articles from PubMed Central published between 2017 and 2022 and used a coding form to manually assess 95 sample size calculations for reproducibility and errors.

ResultsWe estimate that more than 48,000 articles published between 2017 and 2022 and indexed in PubMed Central or PubMed report using G*Power (i.e., 0.65% [95% CI: 0.62% - 0.67%] of articles). We could reproduce 2% (2/95) of the sample size calculations without making any assumptions, and likely reproduce another 28% (27/95) after making assumptions. Many calculations were not reported transparently enough to assess whether an error was present (75%; 71/95) or whether the sample size calculation was for a statistical test that appeared in the results section of the publication (48%; 46/95). Few articles that performed a calculation for a mixed-design ANOVA unambiguously selected the non-default option (8%; 3/36).

Inflammatory and wound-healing programs are requisite features of solid tumorigenesis, wherein alterations to immune and non-immune stromal elements enable loss of homeostasis during tumor evolution. The precise mechanisms by which normal stromal cell states limit tissue plasticity and tumorigenesis, and which are lost during tumor progression, remain largely unknown. Here we show that healthy pancreatic mesenchyme expresses the paracrine signaling molecule KITL, also known as stem cell factor, and identify loss of stromal KITL during tumorigenesis as tumor-promoting. Genetic inhibition of mesenchymal KITL in the contexts of homeostasis, injury, and cancer together indicate a role for KITL signaling in maintenance of pancreas tissue architecture, such that loss of the stromal KITL pool increased tumor growth and reduced survival of tumor-bearing mice. Together, these findings implicate loss of mesenchymal KITL as a mechanism for establishing a tumor-permissive microenvironment.

Statement of significanceBy analyzing transcriptional programs in healthy and tumor-associated pancreatic mesenchyme, we find that a sub-population of mesenchymal cells in healthy pancreas tissue express the paracrine signaling factor KITL. Loss of mesenchymal KITL is an accompanying and permissive feature of pancreas tumor evolution, with potential implications for cancer interception.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Visual working memory (VWM) is an important brain function that allows us to maintain a mental representation of the world around us, but its capacity and precision peaks by around 20 years old and decreases steadily throughout the rest of our lives. This research examined the functional brain network dynamics associated with VWM throughout the lifespan and found that Default Mode Network and Fronto-Parietal Network states were more well represented in individuals with better VWM. Furthermore, transitions between the Visual/Somatomotor Network state and the Attention Network state were more well-represented in older adults, and a network control theory simulation demonstrated that structural connectivity differences supporting this transition were associated with better VWM, especially in middle-aged individuals. The structural connectivity of regions from all states was important for supporting this transition in younger adults, while regions within the Visual/Somatomotor and Attention Network states were more important in older adults. These findings demonstrate that structural connectivity supports flexible, functional dynamics that allow for better VWM with age and may lead to important interventions to uphold healthy VWM throughout the lifespan.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

These advances have led to near-complete chromosome assemblies for numerous organisms, which are invaluable to various biological and medical research fields. However, regions with complex repetitive structure continue to represent a challenge for genome assembly algorithms. Specifically in these regions, robust and comprehensive solutions for the assessment of assembly accuracy and completeness do not exist. In this study we focus on the assembly of biomedically important antibody-encoding immunoglobulin (IG) loci, which are characterized by complex duplications and repeat structures. High-quality full-length assemblies for these loci are critical for resolving haplotype-level annotations of IG genes, without which, functional and evolutionary studies of antibody immunity across vertebrates are not tractable. We developed a pipeline, ""CloseRead"", that generates multiple assembly verification metrics for analysis and visualization; these metrics expand upon those of existing quality assessment tools. Using CloseRead, we systematically assessed the accuracy and completeness of IG loci in publicly available assemblies of 74 vertebrate species, identifying regions impacted by assembly errors. For a subset of species, we were able to correct assembly errors through targeted reassembly. We also demonstrated that inspecting assembly graphs for problematic regions can both identify the root cause of assembly errors and illuminate solutions for improving erroneous assemblies. Together, our analysis demonstrated the utility of assembly assessment for improving IG locus assembly completeness and accuracy. The application of this approach will be critical to ensuring that we build the most complete and accurate curated sets of IG genes across species.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) tumor samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

In the context of the microtubule cytoskeleton, which is critically involved in a wide range of cellular activities, this is particularly striking as tubulin is one of the most conserved proteins while microtubule dynamic instability is highly temperature sensitive. We thus lack a mechanistic framework that links functional adaptability with environmental pressures. Here, we leverage the diversity of natural tubulin variants from three closely related frog species that live at different temperatures: we combine in vitro reconstitution assays, quantitative biochemistry, and cryogenic electron microscopy to show how a small number of primary sequence changes influences the energy landscape of tubulin interactions and thereby mediates cold-adaptation and microtubule stability. This study thus broadens our conceptual framework for understanding microtubule dynamics and provides insights into how conserved cellular processes are tailored to different ecological niches.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Prior work established that heteroplasmic mtDNA variants can be used to delineate clonality in hematopoiesis, but they have limited ability to reconstruct cellular phylogenies. However, a recent report by Weng et al. challenges the current paradigm by describing an unprecedented number of shared mtDNA variants between cells that reportedly resolve high-resolution phylogenetic trees. We re-examined the claims of Weng et al., and identified two major points of concern regarding this unprecedented connectedness. First, shared variants between cells are disproportionately detected in a single molecule per cell, and second, these variants are enriched 10-20-fold at the edges of mtDNA molecules, reminiscent of artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. Further, our analyses show that pruning low support and likely artificial mtDNA variants removes nearly all of the reported phylogenetic structure. Thus, we strongly caution against using mtDNA variant calling workflows that rely on minimal evidence, including the computational pipeline introduced in Weng et al., as variants with high connectedness and low evidence are likely artifacts that lead to the construction of false phylogenies.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

However, there are few convincing modifiable factors for PCa and little is known about their potential interaction with genetic risk. We analyzed incident PCa cases (n=6,155) and controls (n=98,257) of European and African ancestry from the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort to evaluate the role of neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES)-and how it may interact with PRS-on PCa risk. Methods: We evaluated a multi-ancestry PCa PRS containing 269 genetic variants to understand the association of germline genetics with PCa in UKB. Using the English Indices of Deprivation, a set of validated metrics that quantify lack of resources within geographical areas, we performed logistic regression to investigate the main effects and interactions between nSES deprivation, PCa PRS, and PCa. Results: The PCa PRS was strongly associated with PCa (OR=2.04; 95%CI=2.00-2.09; P<0.001). Additionally, nSES deprivation indices were inversely associated with PCa: employment (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001), education (OR=0.94; 95%CI=0.83-0.98; P<0.001), health (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001), and income (OR=0.91; 95%CI=0.86-0.96; P<0.001). The PRS effects showed little heterogeneity across nSES deprivation indices, except for the Townsend Index (P=0.03) Conclusions: We reaffirmed genetics as a risk factor for PCa and identified nSES deprivation domains that influence PCa detection and are potentially correlated with environmental exposures that are a risk factor for PCa. These findings also suggest that nSES and genetic risk factors for PCa act independently.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

The phagosome then fuses with endosomes and lysosomes to digest the particle. After particle degradation, phagosomes fragment to reform lysosomes and maintain phagocyte degradative capacity. As finite systems, phagocytes have a maximal phagocytic capacity, which should blunt further phagocytosis. However, the processes responsible for appetite exhaustion are not known. We found that macrophages at capacity retained Fc{gamma} receptors levels and did not shrink in size. Instead, surface membrane in-folding, membrane tension, and cortical F-actin were reduced in exhausted macrophages. Moreover, exhausted macrophages were depleted for both endosomes and lysosomes, and consequently, focal endosome exocytosis in remaining externally bound particles was blunted. In comparison, if phagosome resolution was permitted macrophages regained the phagocytic appetite. Altogether, we propose that depletion of the endomembrane pools is a major determinant of phagocytic fatigue as macrophages reach their phagocytic capacity, though other processes are also at play.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Surprisingly, we found that reductions in glucose- stimulated mitochondrial respiration in SC-islets were not associated with alterations in mitochondrial mass, structure, or genome integrity.

However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different C/T ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the C/T ratio and, remarkably, the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness aligns very closely to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to T, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1/T). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats' response rates during the (never-reinforced) inter-trial interval, which was directly proportional to the contextual rate of reinforcement (1/C). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US.

Understanding how these phenomena are intertwined and how aging affects those is crucial for prevention and the future development of interventions.

MethodsWe utilized the UK Biobank which includes a total of 502,382 participants between 40 and 70 years old. We used logistic regression models and cox proportional hazard models and compared hazard ratios.

ResultsThe odds of reporting tinnitus in the older age group (i.e., older than 58 years) were increased by 43.3% and a one decibel increase in the SRT enhanced the odds for tinnitus by 13.5%. For our second analysis regarding hearing loss, the risk of dementia increased by 9.2% with an increase by one decibel in the SRT score. In terms of aging, each additional year increased the risk by 19.2%. Tinnitus alone showed a significant influence with a hazard ratio of 52.1%, however, when adding hearing loss, age and various covariates, the effect vanished.

ConclusionFindings confirm that tinnitus is indeed related to aging, but presumably independent of the aging processes accompanying the development of dementia. This highlights the urge to further investigate the impact of aging on neural processes that are relevant for alterations in the auditory systems (e.g., leading to the development of tinnitus or hearing loss) as well as for increased vulnerability in terms of neurodegenerative diseases.

Key Points

QuestionAging and hearing loss have been linked to dementia and tinnitus respectively. But is there a direct influence of tinnitus on dementia risk?

FindingsIn this case-control study, data derived from the UK Biobank was used to first replicate previous findings establishing aging as a risk factor for tinnitus and hearing loss as a risk factor for dementia. Tinnitus was not found to increase the risk of dementia.

MeaningAging is related to tinnitus, however, since tinnitus does not influence the risk of dementia, we conclude that the aging processes that determine tinnitus are independent of neural processes facilitating the development of dementia.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

In vitro and in vivo, mRNA-LNPs did not stimulate myeloid cell production of IL-12, and the CD8+ T cell response to vaccination with the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) was IL-12 independent. However, co-administration of IL-12 mRNA-LNPs with OVA mRNA-LNPs enhanced OVA-specific CD8+ T cell expansion, improved acquisition of effector function and resulted in an expanded memory CD8+ T cell pool.

When compared to meiotic maturation, relatively little is known about the key processes that happen in growing oocytes. Since the first visualization of oocyte chromatin under the electron microscope, we have known that growing oocytes undergo a fundamental transition from the non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) to surrounded nucleolus (SN) chromatin configuration. NSN-to-SN transition is crucial for subsequent embryonic development after fertilization, but what drives NSN-to-SN transition during mammalian oocyte development is still unknown. Here we show that natural degradation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) by segregase and proteasome drives NSN-to-SN transition, challenging the conventional view that transcriptional silencing and NSN-to-SN transition are driven by independent epigenetic mechanisms in mammalian oocytes.

The final step of oocyte growth, which reorganizes chromatin from the uncondensed, non-surrounded nucleolus (NSN) configuration to the condensed, surrounded nucleolus (SN) configuration, is essential for embryonic development after fertilization. However, the mechanism of NSN-to-SN transition remains unknown. Here, we identify RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) degradation as the key driver of this process. RNAPII inhibitors, but not nucleoside-based transcription inhibitors, swiftly induced RNAPII degradation and NSN-to-SN transition in oocytes. Strikingly, induced SN-like nuclei recapitulated epigenetic features, chromatin interactions and developmental potential in SN oocytes. Using segregase and proteasome inhibitors and the newly established scFv miniTrim-Away for nuclear proteins, we further demonstrate that RNAPII degradation is necessary and sufficient for NSN-to-SN transition in mouse and human. RNAPII degradation globally cleared RNAPII from transcriptionally active chromatin and increased chromatin dynamics, concomitantly leading to transcriptional silencing and chromatin rearrangement in oocytes. Our study elucidates the framework of chromatin reorganization in growing mammalian oocytes and provides an alternative source of fully grown oocyte nuclei, representing a milestone for the potential use of growing oocytes in reproductive medicine.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

In response to infection, TIRs can produce a cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose (ADPR) signaling molecule, which activates an effector that depletes the host of the essential metabolite NAD+ to limit phage propagation. How bacterial TIRs recognize phage infection is not known. Here we describe the sensing mechanism for the staphylococcal Thoeris defense system, which consists of two TIR domain sensors, ThsB1 and ThsB2, and the effector ThsA. We show that the major capsid protein of phage {Phi}80 forms a complex with ThsB1 and ThsB2, which is sufficient for the synthesis of 1-3 glycocyclic ADPR (gcADPR) and subsequent activation of NAD+ cleavage by ThsA. Consistent with this, phages that escape Thoeris immunity harbor mutations in the capsid that prevent complex formation. We show that capsid proteins from staphylococcal Siphoviridae belonging to the capsid serogroup B, but not A, are recognized by ThsB1/B2, a result that suggests that capsid recognition by Sau-Thoeris and other anti-phage defense systems may be an important evolutionary force behind the structural diversity of prokaryotic viruses.

We searched CENTRAL, EMBASE and PubMed for (quasi)-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published from database inception to November 24th, 2022. Trials comparing antibiotic treatments with different numbers of antibiotics were included. A patient was considered to have acquired resistance if, at the follow-up culture, a resistant bacterium (as defined by the study authors) was detected that had not been present in the baseline culture. We combined results using a random effects model and performed meta-regression and stratified analyses. The trials risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane tool.

42 trials were eligible and 29, including 5054 patients, were qualified for statistical analysis. In most trials, resistance development was not the primary outcome and studies lacked power. The combined odds ratio (OR) for the acquisition of resistance comparing the group with the higher number of antibiotics with the comparison group was 1.23 (95% CI 0.68-2.25), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 =77%). We identified tentative evidence for potential beneficial or detrimental effects of antibiotic combination therapy for specific pathogens or medical conditions.

The evidence for combining a higher number of antibiotics compared to fewer from RCTs is scarce and overall, is compatible with both benefit or harm.

We combined a backward masking paradigm with multivariate analysis on EEG and fMRI data to isolate and characterize the nature of recurrent processing. We find that recurrent processing substantially shapes visual representations across the ventral visual stream, starting early on at around 100ms in early visual cortex (EVC) and in two later phases of around 175 and 300ms in lateral occipital cortex (LOC), adding persistent rather than transient neural dynamics to visual processing.

CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, [1]) is a novel enzyme-tethering method for epigenomic profiling, initially developed for mammalian cells. CUT&Tag has several advantages compared to the most commonly used epigenomic profiling methods such as Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). CUT&Tag allows epigenenomic profiling from a much less amount of starting material compared to ChIP-seq. CUT&Tag is based on the in situ cleavage of DNA by enzymes tethered to antibodies, while in ChIP-seq, the cleavage is done by a nearly random fragmentation step. In theory, this difference in the way of cleaving DNA allows CUT&Tag to reach a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Therefore, CUT&Tag holds the potential to profile the genome-wide distribution at a high resolution even from a small amount of plant tissues.

ResultsWe profiled the genome-wide distribution of three histone modifications, H3K27me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, from a few seedlings of Arabidopsis that weighed around 0.01 grams. By comparing the H3K27me3 profiles generated from ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag, we showed that CUT&Tag and ChIP-seq capture the same broad lines of the epigenomes, but they also revealed different sets of peaks. Analysis using the CUT&Tag datasets for the three histone modifications revealed their genomic locations and their relationship with the gene expression level, which are consistent with the expected effect of these histone marks on gene transcription. By comparing to the nucleosome occupancy data, we show that CUT&Tag reached nucleosomal resolution, a much higher resolution than ChIP-seq. In the end, we presented that the increased resolution of CUT&Tag could better reveal the exon enrichment of histone modifications and the epigenetic states of the +1 nucleosome, showing benefits and advantages that this technique could bring to the field of plant epigenetics and chromatin study in general.

ConclusionCUT&Tag is a valid, easy-to-perform, cost-effective, and reliable approach for efficient epigenomic profiling in Arabidopsis, even with limited amount of starting material and provides a higher resolution compared to ChIP-seq. Because the CUT&Tag protocol starting input is isolated nuclei, it is also applicable to other model and non-model plants.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

We now report high-resolution structures showing new transitions in the kinesin mechanochemical cycle, including power stroke fluctuations upon ATP binding and a post-hydrolysis state with bound ADP + free phosphate. We find that rate-limiting ADP release occurs upon microtubule binding, accompanied by central {beta}-sheet twisting, which triggers the power stroke - stalk rotation and neck mimic docking - upon ATP binding. Microtubule release occurs with {beta}-strand-to-loop transitions, implying that {beta}-strand refolding induces Pi release and the recovery stroke. The strained {beta}-sheet during the power stroke and strand-to-loop transitions identify the {beta}-sheet as the long-sought motor spring.

TeaserStalk rotation, {beta}-sheet twisting and refolding, and neck mimic docking drive the reversed working stroke of kinesin-14

INTRODUCTIONKinesin family proteins couple ATP hydrolysis to microtubule binding, generating force to produce steps or displacements along microtubules. The mechanism by which kinesins and other cytoskeletal motor proteins produce force is not fully understood. A current hypothesis is that the motors contain a spring-like or elastic element that creates strain under load during nucleotide binding or release, followed by a strain-relieving conformational change that produces force and a working stroke of the motor. The spring has not yet been identified for any motor. The power stroke differs for different motors - it consists of neck linker docking for plus-end directed kinesin-1 or a swing of the helical stalk for minus-end directed kinesin-14.

RATIONALEDespite considerable research, the molecular dynamics of the kinesin-14 power stroke are still obscure, impeded by the weak microtubule binding of the motor. We overcame the weak binding by introducing a point mutation into the motor that results in faster ATP hydrolysis than wild type and tighter microtubule binding, which enabled us to resolve the motor mode of action. We now present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and x-ray structures of key mechanochemical states across the full force-producing cycle of a kinesin dimeric motor.

RESULTSThe new structures represent five different nucleotide states - two pre-power stroke states, a fluctuating power stroke, and two post-power stroke states. The structures are both microtubule-attached and unattached. They show the motor trapped in previously unreported transition states and reveal new conformational changes involved in energy transduction. The new transition states include a transient state in which the power stroke fluctuates during ATP binding and a new state of a kinesin motor bound to ADP and free Pi prior to phosphate release. The conformational changes include the folding of the kinesin-14 neck mimic into a structure resembling the docked kinesin-1 neck linker, accompanying the power stroke, and previously unreported {beta}-strand-to-loop transitions with stored free energy that potentially induce Pi release and drive the recovery stroke. We interpret the new structures in the context of the hypothesis that the central {beta}-sheet undergoes distortional changes during the mechanochemical cycle that store and release free energy, functioning as the elusive spring of the motors.

CONCLUSIONThe new structures show that force is produced by coupled movements of the helical stalk, central {beta}-sheet, and neck mimic, and uncover structural changes during the power stroke that are conserved among kinesins and myosin. We find that kinesin-14 binds to a microtubule by one head during the mechanical cycle, undergoes rate-limiting ADP release, and changes in conformation during ATP binding and hydrolysis to produce force. Notably, kinesin-14 utilizes the same mechanical strategy for force production as other kinesins but couples the changes to a large swing of the stalk, an innovation derived from myosin that is not observed for kinesin-1 or other kinesin motors. Force is produced by rearranging the binding surfaces of the stalk, strand {beta}1, helices [a]4 and [a]6, and the neck mimic, and by twisting and shortening strands of the central {beta}-sheet. These structural changes produce a power stroke - rotation of the helical stalk accompanied by neck mimic docking - during the transition from the nucleotide-free to ATP-bound state, and a reverse stroke after phosphate release that reprimes the motor for the next microtubule binding interaction.

As the virus has now been circulating entirely among dogs for 20 years, we here update our understanding of the evolution of virus in its new host. As a host-switched virus, H3N2 CIV will also reveal any host-adaptive changes arising during thousands of infections within its new host, and our analysis showed that the virus has evolved at a constant rate. CIV was first introduced into North America in 2015 from Korea, and we specifically examined the epidemiology of the virus among dogs in North America since then, including local outbreaks, regional die-outs, and repeated reintroduction from Asia. The H3N2 CIV now appears endemic only in China after dying out in South Korea around 2017. Virus lineages circulating in China appear to have seeded the most recent US outbreaks - with 2 or 3 introductions into North America during the past 3 years. Combining clinical reports, diagnostic testing data, and analysis of viral genomes we show that the virus spreads rapidly among dogs in kennels and shelters in different regions - likely dying out locally after all those animals become infected and immune. The overall epidemic therefore requires longer-distance dispersal of virus to initiate outbreaks in new locations. Patterns of spread in the USA may select viruses most adapted to those dense populations, which may lack the properties required for efficient long-distance transfers to other dog populations that would keep the virus in prolonged circulation.

IMPORTANCEViruses occasionally jump into new hosts to cause epidemics and may spread widely due to movement of humans or animals, or their viruses, with profound consequences for global health. The emergence and epidemiology of new epidemic viruses in companion animals provides a model for understanding disease dynamics and evolution. The H3N2 canine influenza virus arose from an avian virus, and infected dogs provide many opportunities for human exposure. H3N2 CIV transmission is dominated by fast-moving outbreaks within dense populations in animal shelters or kennels, while sustaining the epidemic likely requires movement of virus to more distant dog populations. Viral spread within North Americahas only been sustained for a few years at a time after which the virus dies out. The epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of this virus in this structured host population shows how an acute respiratory pathogen can emerge and spread in a new host and population.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Two inversions were transferred from deepwater pelagic Diplotaxodon via admixture, while the others established early in the deep benthics. Introgression of haplotypes from lineages inside and outside the Malawi radiation coincided with bursts of species diversification. Inversions show evidence for transient sex linkage and a striking excess of protein changing substitutions pointing towards selection on sensory, behavioural and reproductive genes.

However, the lack of a standardized metadata format for small-scale perturbation expression datasets in public repositories hinders their reuse. To address this issue, we developed PerturbAtlas, an add-value resource that re-analyzes publicly archived RNA-seq libraries to provide quantitative data on gene expression, transcript profiles, and alternative splicing events following genetic perturbation. PerturbAtlas assists users in identifying trends at the gene and isoform levels in perturbation assays by re-analyzing a curated set of 122,801 RNA-seq libraries across 13 species. This resource is freely available at https://perturbatlas.kratoss.site as both raw data tables and an interactive browser, allowing searches by species, tissue, or genomic features. The results provide detailed information on alterations following perturbations, accessible through both forward and reverse approaches, thereby enabling the exploration of perturbation consequences and the identification of potential causal perturbations.

While RNAi mediates antiviral innate immunity in plants and many invertebrates, vertebrates adopted sequence-independent response and their Dicer produces siRNAs inefficiently because it is adapted to process small hairpin microRNA precursors in the gene-regulating microRNA pathway. Mammalian RNAi is thus a rudimentary pathway of unclear significance. To investigate its antiviral potential, we modified mouse Dicer locus to express a truncated variant (Dicer{Delta}HEL1) known to stimulate RNAi. Next, we analyzed how Dicer{Delta}HEL1/wt mice respond to four RNA viruses: Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and encephalomyocarditis virus (ECMV) from Picornaviridae; tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) from Flaviviridae; and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) from Arenaviridae.

Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) has emerged as a powerful tool to elucidate the evolutionary history of protein families and identify sequence determinants of protein function. Here, we present AncFlow, an automated software pipeline that integrates phylogenetic analysis, subfamily identification, and ASR to generate ancestral protein sequences for structural prediction using state-of-the-art tools like AlphaFold. AncFlow streamlines the process of ASR by combining multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic tree inference, subfamily identification, and ancestral sequence reconstruction from unaligned protein sequences. The reconstructed ancestral sequences are then subjected to structural prediction using AlphaFold, enabling the investigation of the structural basis of functional divergence within protein families. We validated AncFlow using two well-characterized protein families: acyltransferases and dehydrogenases. The pipeline successfully reconstructed ancestral sequences for multiple internal nodes of the phylogenetic trees, and their predicted structures were compared with those of extant proteins. By analyzing the structural similarities and differences between ancestral and extant proteins, we gained insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the functional diversification within these families. AncFlow demonstrates the potential of integrating ASR and structural prediction to unravel the structural basis of functional divergence in protein families. The insights gained from this approach can guide protein engineering efforts, facilitating the design of proteins with desired functions. As the amount of sequence data continues to grow, AncFlow provides a valuable tool for exploring the evolutionary landscape of proteins and accelerating the discovery of novel protein functions.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

Despite this progress, more biomarkers, ideally in blood, are needed for effective patient management and disease monitoring for Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

METHODSWe employed the Nucleic Acid-Linked Immuno-Sandwich Assay (NULISA) central nervous system (CNS) panel for biomarker quantification in plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, Lewy body dementia, progranulin (GRN) mutation carriers and matched controls.

RESULTSNULISA identified p-tau217 and NfL as the most significantly deregulated plasma biomarkers in the AD continuum and GRN mutation carriers, respectively. Importantly, numerous novel and significant proteomic changes were observed in each disease comparison, which included proteins involved in synaptic processing, inflammation, microglial reactivity, TDP-43 and -synuclein pathology. Plasma and serum act as complimentary biofluids.

CONCLUSIONWe highlight the potential of next-generation biomarker identification tools, such as NULISA, to detect novel proteomic features that incorporate established biomarkers like p-tau217 and NfL. These findings highlight the importance of continued biomarker discovery to enhance patient management, improve treatment decisions, and better understand the complexities of neurodegenerative disorders.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

Advances in population-scale sequencing now provide an unprecedented opportunity to uncover additional large-effect rare genetic risk factors and expand our understanding of disease mechanisms.

MethodsWe leveraged whole-genome sequence data with linked electronic health records from 490,560 UK Biobank participants, identifying 3,809 PD cases and 247,101 controls without a neurological disorder. We performed both variant- and gene-level association analyses to identify novel genetic associations with PD. We analyzed two additional independent case-control cohorts for replication (totaling 3,739 cases and 58,156 controls). Additionally, we performed functional validation of a novel PD association in a human synuclein-expressing Drosophila model.

FindingsIn the UK Biobank, we replicated associations in well-established loci including GBA1 and LRRK2. We also identified a novel association between protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in ITSN1 and an increased risk of PD, with an effect size exceeding those of established loci (Fishers Exact Test: p=6.1x10-7; Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 10.53 [5.20, 21.34]). We replicated the ITSN1 risk signal in a meta-analysis across all cohorts (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test p=5.7x10-9; Odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 9.20 [4.66, 16.70]). In Drosophila, haploinsufficiency of the ITSN1 ortholog (Dap160) exacerbated -synuclein- induced compound eye degeneration and motor deficits.

InterpretationWe establish ITSN1 as a novel risk gene for PD, with PTVs substantially increasing disease risk. ITSN1 encodes a scaffold protein involved in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, a critical pathway increasingly recognized in PD pathogenesis. Our findings highlight the power of large-scale sequencing coupled with preclinical functional modeling to identify rare variant associations and elucidate disease mechanisms.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449666

Recent technological advances in DNA sequencing-based assays have revealed locus- and chromatin state-specific structural patterns at the length scale of a few nucleosomes ([~]1 kb). However, interpreting these data sets remains challenging. Radiation-induced correlated cleavage of chromatin (RICC-seq) is one such chromatin structure assay that maps DNA-DNA-contacts at base pair resolution by sequencing single-stranded DNA fragments released from irradiated cells. Here, we develop a flexible modeling and simulation framework to enable the interpretation of RICC-seq data in terms of oligonucleosome structure ensembles. Nucleosomes are modeled as rigid bodies with excluded volume and adjustable DNA wrapping, connected by linker DNA modeled as a worm-like chain. We validate the models parameters against cryo-electron microscopy and sedimentation data. Our results show that RICC-seq is sensitive to nucleosome spacing, nucleosomal DNA wrapping, and the strength of inter-nucleosome interactions. We show that nucleosome repeat lengths consistent with orthogonal assays can be extracted from experimental RICC-seq data using a 1D convolutional neural net trained on RICC-seq signal predicted from simulated ensembles. We thus provide a suite of analysis tools that add quantitative structural interpretability to RICC-seq experiments.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449666

We find that white matter connections are organized by cytoarchitecture, eccentricity, and category from birth. Connectivity profiles of functional regions in the same cytoarchitectonic area are similar from birth and develop in parallel, with decreases in endpoint connectivity to lateral occipital, and parietal, and somatosensory cortex, and increases to lateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, connections between VTC and early visual cortex are organized topographically by eccentricity bands and predict eccentricity biases in VTC.

We demonstrated different coverage landscapes of k-mers enriched in deer and bats and unraveled 148 mutations in enriched k-mers yielded from the comparison of viral metagenomes between bat and human isolates. We observed that the third position within a genetic codon is prone to mutations, resulting in a high frequency of synonymous mutations of amino acids harboring the same physicochemical properties as unaltered amino acids.

At templated AP-sites, HMCES DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) regulate replication fork speed while avoiding APE1-mediated cytotoxic double-strand breaks (DSB). Whereas the role of HMCES at template DNA strand is well studied, its consequences on nascent DNA are less understood. Here, we provide evidence that HMCES play detrimental roles during removal of 5- hydroxymethyl-2-deoxycytidine (5hmdC)-derived 5-hydroxymethyl-2-deoxyuridine (5hmdU) by BER at replication forks. HRD cells display heightened HMCES chromatin levels, which increase upon 5hmdC exposure, suggesting that HMCES binds both spontaneous and 5hmdC-induced AP-sites. HMCES depletion largely suppresses 5hmdC- mediated Fancd2-/- replication fork defects, chromosomal aberrations and cell lethality, suggesting that HMCES is responsible for the replication fork impairment and lethality observed in HRD cells. Therefore, HMCES-DPCs are a novel source of BER-initiated PRIMPOL-mediated ssDNA gaps, implying endogenous DPCs as a source of DNA damage in HRD tumours.

A prominent example of a self-assembly process forming a structure whose size scales with cell size is Cdc42-driven cell polarization and subsequent septin ring formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms that determine Cdc42 cluster and septin ring size are still unclear. Combining computational modeling, live-cell imaging and genetic manipulations, we show here that positive feedback in the polarization pathway, together with the amount of polarity proteins increasing with cell size, can account for the increase of the Cdc42 cluster area with cell size, and as a consequence also the scaling of the septin ring diameter. We demonstrate that in bni1{Delta} cells, which have a larger septin ring compared to wild-type cells but a similarly sized Cdc42-GTP cluster, disruption of F-actin cable assembly and polarization toward the bud site results in diffuse exocytosis, causing septin ring enlargement. Furthermore, we find that in cells with impaired negative feedback in the polarization pathway, the Cdc42-GTP cluster area expands compared to wild-type cells, while the septin ring diameter remains mostly unchanged. This decoupling can be partially explained by a high recruitment rate of septin via polarity factors. Taken together, we provide insights into the origin of septin ring size control, in particular the scaling with cell volume, by integrating new experimental findings and mechanistic models of budding yeast polarization.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449667

Through a newly discovered size control mechanism, the sedimented, large droplets shrink by expelling droplet material. The expelled molecules nucleate new droplets at the top of the synthetic cell, which grow and sediment again.

However, the results of radiotherapy can vary widely across different cancer types and even among patients with the same type of cancer. This variability presents a major challenge in optimizing treatment strategies and improving patient survival. Here, we collected radiotherapy phenotype and expression data from 32 TCGA cancer datasets and performed overall survival analysis for 32 cancer types. Additionally, we conducted a signalling pathway enrichment analysis to identify key pathways involved in radiotherapy resistance and sensitivity. Our findings show that radiotherapy improves survival outcomes in certain cancer types, such as GBM, while worsening outcomes in others, such as LGG. Next, we focused on exploring the differences in radiotherapy outcomes between GBM and LGG, focusing on the molecular mechanisms contributing to these variations. The differential regulation of pathways related to programmed cell death, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, chromosome condensation, antiviral responses, and interferon signaling between GBM and LGG patients may elucidate the underlying reasons for these observed differences. These insights underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches and the need for further research to improve radiotherapy outcomes in cancer patients.","NA","medrxiv",1722636449667

Here, we estimate biological age of 11 organs from 44,526 individuals in the UK Biobank using an antibody-based proteomics platform to model disease and mortality risk. Organ age estimates are associated with future onset of heart failure (heart age HR=1.83), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (lung age HR=1.39), type II diabetes (kidney age HR=1.58), and Alzheimers disease (brain age HR=1.81) and sensitive to lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, hormone replacement therapy, or supplements. Remarkably, the accrual of aged organs progressively increases mortality risk while a youthful brain and immune system are uniquely associated with disease-free longevity. These findings support the use of plasma proteins for monitoring organ health and the efficacy of drugs targeting organ aging disease.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449667

Here we show that language models trained on tokens generated by evolution can act as evolutionary simulators to generate functional proteins that are far away from known proteins. We present ESM3, a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. ESM3 can follow complex prompts combining its modalities and is highly responsive to biological alignment. We have prompted ESM3 to generate fluorescent proteins with a chain of thought. Among the generations that we synthesized, we found a bright fluorescent protein at far distance (58% identity) from known fluorescent proteins. Similarly distant natural fluorescent proteins are separated by over five hundred million years of evolution.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449667
"The Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect: Pupils size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest during exhalation","10.1101/2024.06.27.599713","biorxiv",103.08,0,0,8,97.13,"Schaefer, M.; Mathot, S.; Lundqvist, M.; Lundstrom, J.

However, this notion has recently been challenged. Here, we systematically address this question by conducting a study encompassing three experiments (two resting tasks and one visual perception task), with the latter two being pre-registered. Collectively, across nasal and oral breathing, resting, and task conditions, our experiments consistently and robustly demonstrate that pupil size is smallest around inhalation onset and largest around peak exhalation. This phenomenon, which we term the Respiratory-Pupillary Phase Effect (RPPE), directly contradicts the long-held notion that pupils are largest during inhalation and smallest during exhalation. Notably, the dilation and constriction processes overlap with both phases. The observed consistency and significance of the RPPE across various conditions underscore the need for further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and potential impact on human behavior.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449667
"PAM: Predictive attention mechanism for neural decoding of visual perception","10.1101/2024.06.04.596589","biorxiv",99.08,0,0,0,95.58,"Dado, T.; Le, L.; van Gerven, M.; Gucluturk, Y.; Guclu, U.","Thirza Dado","Radboud University","2024-06-08","1","new results","cc_by","neuroscience","https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/06/08/2024.06.04.596589.source.xml","Attention mechanisms enhance deep learning models by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input data. We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449667

They form superhelical structures around which DNA is wrapped. Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1722636449667
