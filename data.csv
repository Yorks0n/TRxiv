Uncovering the genome-wide activity of all gene regulators across tissues is therefore needed to understand how the genome is regulated during development. Here, we take a first step forward towards achieving this goal. Using CUT&RUN, we systematically measured the genome-wide binding profiles of key transcription factors and cofactors that mediate the activity of ontogenetically relevant signaling pathways in select mouse tissues at two developmental stages. Computation of the numerous genome-wide binding datasets unveiled a large degree of tissue and time-specific activity for each gene regulator, and several factor-specific idiosyncrasies. Moreover, we identified 'popular' regulatory regions that are bound by a multitude of pathway regulators. Popular regions tend to be more evolutionarily conserved, implying their essentiality. Consistently, they lie in the proximity of genes whose dysregulation causes early embryonic lethality in the mouse. Moreover, the human homologs of these regions are also bound by many gene regulators and are highly conserved in human populations, indicating that they retain functional relevance for human development. This work constitutes a decisive step towards under-standing how the genome is simultaneously read and used by gene regulators in a holistic fashion and unveils multiple genomic mechanisms that drive embryonic development.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

During REM sleep, the brains internal representation of direction keeps shifting like that of an awake animal moving through its environment6-8. What causes these shifts, given the immobility of the sleeping animal? Here we show that the superior colliculus of the mouse, a motor command center involved in orienting movements9-15, issues motor commands during REM sleep, e.g. turn left, that are similar to those issued in the awake behaving animal. Strikingly, these motor commands, despite not being executed, shift the internal representation of direction as if the animal had turned. Thus, during REM sleep, the brain simulates actions by issuing motor commands that, while not executed, have consequences as if they had been. This study suggests that the sleeping brain, while disengaged from the external world, uses its internal model of the world to simulate interactions with it.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Besides the CTCF/cohesin machinery, only a few nuclear factors have been studied for a direct role in physically connecting regulatory elements. Here, we show via acute degradation experiments that LDB1 directly and broadly promotes enhancer-promoter loops. Most LDB1-mediated contacts, even those spanning hundreds of kb, can form in the absence of CTCF, cohesin, or YY1 as determined via the use of multiple degron systems. Moreover, an engineered LDB1-driven chromatin loop is cohesin independent. Cohesin-driven loop extrusion does not stall at LDB1 occupied sites but may aid the formation of a subset of LDB1 anchored loops. Leveraging the dynamic reorganization of nuclear architecture during the transition from mitosis to G1-phase, we establish a relationship between LDB1-dependent interactions in the context of TAD organization and gene activation.

Each of the two genomes were broken up into 100-kB segments, each of which was searched for matches to a large set of porcine queries. All scans sought matches to the same set of 813,194 40-mer nucleotide queries randomly selected from the genome of Sus scrofa (domestic pig). For each of the two study organisms, mean segmental match rates (MSMRs) were then calculated for all segments in each of three categories: those segments occurring on autosomes, those on the X chromosome, and those on the Y chromosome.

ResultsIn scans of single-copy regions (euchromatin) in both their Y chromosomes and their autosomes, it was found that the number of matches to randomly selected porcine queries was higher in humans than in bonobos. When autosomes were compared, matches were 1.3% higher in humans than in bonobos. This figure is equal to the percentage of human autosomal nucleotide positions bearing nucleotides that match in pig but not in bonobo. Remarkably, it agrees with the percentage of autosomal nucleotides previously reported to differ in bonobos and humans. So, the results of this study indicate that essentially all the nucleotide positions that differ in humans and bonobos, are the same in humans and pigs. In addition, the number of matches to pig queries found on the human Y chromosome was 34.5% higher than on the bonobo Y, and 12.4% higher than on the chimpanzee Y (the chimpanzee figure may be the more reliable of the two, since the bonobo Y nucleotide sequence file scanned contained only unlocalized scaffolds). MSMRs for the human and bonobo X chromosomes did not significantly differ.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Determination of a 3.6 A inward-facing crystal structure lacking the cytoplasmic N-and C-tails, molecular dynamics (MD), and functional studies have led to speculative models of its transport mechanism and determination of substrate specificity. Here, we report full-length cryo-EM structures of UapA in new inward-facing apo- and substrate-loaded conformations at 2.05-3.5 A in detergent and lipid nanodiscs. The structures reveal in an unprecedented level of detail the role of water molecules and lipids in substrate binding, specificity, dimerization, and activity, rationalizing accumulated functional data. Unexpectedly, the N-tail is structured and interacts with both the core and scaffold domains. This finding, combined with mutational and functional studies and MD, points out how N-tail interactions couple proper subcellular trafficking and transport activity by wrapping UapA in a conformation necessary for ER-exit and but also critical for elevator-type conformational changes associated with substrate translocation once UapA has integrated into the plasma membrane. Our study provides detailed insights into important aspects of the elevator-type transport mechanism and opens novel issues on how the evolution of extended cytosolic tails in eukaryotic transporters, apparently needed for subcellular trafficking, might have been integrated into the transport mechanism.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Here, we investigate the cellular evolution of the hypothalamic medial preoptic area (MPOA), a brain region that plays a critical role in social behavior, across two sister species of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus and P. polionotus) with divergent social systems. These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the MPOA for males and females of both Peromyscus species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in P. polionotus, a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior. Our MPOA atlas is a powerful resource to investigate how molecular neuronal traits may be evolving to give rise to innate differences in social behavior across animal species.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Previous methods focused on higher heteroplasmy mutations that are limited in number and can be influenced by functional selection, introducing biases for lineage tracing. Although more challenging to detect, intermediate to low heteroplasmy mtDNA mutations are valuable due to their high diversity, abundance, and lower propensity to selection. To enhance mtDNA mutation detection and facilitate fine-scale lineage tracing, we developed the single-cell Regulatory multi-omics with Deep Mitochondrial mutation profiling (ReDeeM) approach, an integrated experimental and computational framework. Recently, some concerns have been raised about the analytical workflow in the ReDeeM framework. Specifically, it was noted that the mutations detected in a single molecule per cell are enriched on edges of mtDNA molecules, suggesting they resemble artifacts reported in other sequencing approaches. It was then proposed that all mutations found in one molecule per cell should be removed. We detail our error correction method, demonstrating that the observed edge mutations are distinct from previously reported sequencing artifacts. We further show that the proposed removal leads to massive elimination of bona fide and informative mutations. Indeed, mutations accumulating on edges impact a minority of all mutation calls (for example, in hematopoietic stem cells, the excess mutations on the edge account for only 4.3%-7.6% of the total). Recognizing the value of addressing edge mutations even after applying consensus correction, we provide an additional filtering option in the ReDeeM-R package. This approach effectively eliminates the position biases, leads to a mutational signature indistinguishable from bona fide mitochondrial mutations, and removes excess low molecule high connectedness mutations. Importantly, this option preserves the large majority of unique mutations identified by ReDeeM, maintaining the ability of ReDeeM to provide a more than 10-fold increase in variant detection compared to previous methods. Additionally, the cells remain well-connected. While there is room for further refinement in mutation calling strategies, the significant advances and biological insights provided by the ReDeeM framework are unique and remain intact. We hope that this detailed discussion and analysis enables the community to employ this approach and contribute to its further development.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

We find that topical but not intravenous delivery is effective in this model. High-doses of phage reduces bacterial burden more effectively than low-doses, and repeated dosing achieves the highest eradication rates. Building on these insights, we developed HydroPhage, a hyaluronan-based hydrogel system that uses dynamic covalent crosslinking to deliver high-titre phages over one week. HydroPhage eradicates infections five times more effectively than intravenous injection. We conclude that hydrogel-based sustained phage delivery enhances the efficacy of phage therapy and offers a practical, well-tolerated option for topical application.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Even very young infants engage in active visual selection, looking less and less as stimuli are repeated (habituation) and regaining interest when novel stimuli are subsequently introduced (dishabituation). The mechanisms underlying these looking time changes remain uncertain, however, due to limits on both the scope of existing formal models and the empirical precision of measurements of infant behavior. To address this, we developed the Rational Action, Noisy Choice for Habituation (RANCH) model, which operates over raw images and makes quantitative predictions of participants' looking behaviors. In a series of pre-registered experiments, we exposed infants and adults to stimuli for varying durations and measured looking time to familiar and novel stimuli. We found that these data were well captured by RANCH. Using RANCH's stimulus-computability, we also tested its out-of-sample predictions about the magnitude of dishabituation in a new experiment in which we manipulated the similarity between the familiar and novel stimulus. By framing looking behaviors as rational decision-making, this work identified how the dynamics of learning and exploration guide our visual attention from infancy through adulthood.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

What factors determine whether a precursor cell differentiates or retains the capacity to divide? Here, we leverage the developmental flexibility of the stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) in Arabidopsis leaves as a model for how flexible decisions are regulated. Using a quantitative approach that combines long-term live imaging and statistical modeling, we discover that cell size is a strong predictor of SLGC behaviour: larger SLGCs divide less often than smaller cells. We propose that cell size is linked to division behaviour at multiple spatial scales. At the neighbourhood scale, cell size correlates with the strength of cell-cell signaling, which affects the rate at which SPEECHLESS (SPCH), a division-promoting transcription factor, is degraded. At the subcellular scale, cell size correlates with nuclear size, which modulates the concentration of SPCH in the nucleus. Our work shows how initial differences in SPCH levels are canalized by nuclear size and cell-cell signaling to inform the behaviour of a flexible cell type.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

To this end, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one the most used microbial host for recombinant protein production due to its rapid growth, well-characterised genetics, and ability to produce recombinant proteins in high yields using modern recombinant DNA technology. However, while there is a plethora of robust protein expression protocols for E. coli, these methods are often unsuitable for high-throughput screening due to their significant resource and time consumption; these protocols are also susceptible to operator error and inconsistency.

To address these challenges, we have developed APEX, a robust and automated protocol for recombinant protein production in E. coli. APEX leverages the accessible, open-source Opentrons OT-2 platform to automate microbial handling and protein expression with high precision and repro-ducibility. APEX can be configured to perform heat shock transformation, colony selection, colony sampling, inoculation, subculturing and protein expression using a low-cost, minimal OT-2 hardware setup. We further demonstrate the efficacy of our automated transformation workflows using a variety of plasmids (2.7-17.7 kb), and exemplify the automated heterologous expression of a diverse array of proteins (27-222 kDa). Designed with customization, modularity and user-friendliness in mind, APEX can be easily adapted to the operators needs without requiring any coding expertise.

The permeability characteristics of the membrane determined several key functions of this network by determining which compounds could enter the compartment and which compounds could not. One key feature of known life is the utilisation of right-handed D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars and left-handed L- amino acid stereochemical isomers (enantiomers), however, it is not clear why life adopted this specific chirality. We previously demonstrated that an archaeal and an intermediate membrane mimic, bearing a mixture of bacterial and archaeal lipid characteristics (a  hybrid membrane), display increased permeability compared to bacterial-like membranes. Here, we investigate if these membranes can drive stereochemical selection on pentose sugars, hexose sugars and amino acids. Using permeability assays of homogenous unilamellar vesicles, we demonstrate that both membranes select for D- ribose and deoxyribose sugars while the hybrid membrane uniquely selects for a reduced alphabet of L- facing amino acids. This repertoire includes alanine, the plausible first L- amino acid utilised. We conclude such compartments could provide stereochemical compound selection thereby demonstrating a solution to the chirality problem during the evolution of life.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Most alphaviruses encode an opal (UGA) termination codon in nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) upstream of the viral polymerase, nsP4. The selective constraints underlying the conservation of the opal codon are poorly understood. Using primate and mosquito cells, we explored the role and selective pressure on the nsP3 opal codon through extensive mutational analysis in the prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). We found that the opal codon is highly favored over all other codons in primate cells under native 37{o}C growth conditions. However, this preference is diminished in mosquito and primate cells grown at a lower temperature. Thus, the primary determinant driving the selection of the opal stop codon is not host genetics but the passaging temperature. We show that the opal codon is preferred over amber and ochre termination codons because it results in the highest translational readthrough and polymerase production. However, substituting the opal codon with sense codons leads to excessive full-length polyprotein (P1234) production, which disrupts optimal nsP polyprotein processing, delays the switch from minus-strand to positive-strand RNA production, and significantly reduces SINV fitness at 37{degrees}C; this fitness defect is relieved at lower temperatures. A naturally occurring suppressor mutation unexpectedly compensates for a delayed transition from minus to genomic RNA production by also delaying the subsequent transition between genomic and sub-genomic RNA production. Our study reveals that the opal stop codon is the best solution for alphavirus replication at 37{o}C, producing enough nsP4 protein to maximize replication without disrupting nsP processing and RNA replication transitions needed for optimal fitness. Our study uncovers the intricate strategy dual-host alphaviruses use at a single codon to optimize fitness.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

It has long been hypothesised that vesicles are directionally transported along phragmoplast microtubules by motor proteins. However, the mechanisms governing the accumulation and immobilisation of vesicles at the phragmoplast midzone remain elusive, and the motor protein responsible has yet to be identified. Here, we show that the plant-specific class II Kinesin-12 (Kinesin12-II) functions as a motor protein that drives vesicle transport towards the phragmoplast midzone in the moss Physcomitrium patens. In kinesin12-II mutants, the directional movement of cell plate materials towards the midzone and their retention were abolished, resulting in delayed cell plate formation and phragmoplast disassembly. A macroscopic phenotype arising from Kinesin12-II disruption was the impediment to gametophore development. We showed that this defect was attributable to the production of aneuploid cells in the early gametophore, where chromosome missegregation occurred because of the incomplete disassembly of phragmoplast microtubules in the preceding cell cycle. These findings suggest that plant Kinesin-12 has evolved to acquire a unique and critical function that facilitates cell plate formation in the presence of phragmoplasts.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

The RNA velocity framework utilizes both spliced and unspliced reads in single cell mRNA preparations to predict future cellular states and estimate transcriptional kinetics. However, current models assume either constant kinetic rates, rates equal for all genes, or rates completely independent of progression through differentiation. Consequently, current models for rate estimation are either underparametrised or overparametrised. Here we developed a new method (diffGEK) which overcomes this issue, and allows comparison of transcriptional rates across different biological conditions. diffGEK assumes that rates can vary over a trajectory, but are smooth functions of the differentiation process. Analysing Jak2 V617F mutant versus wild type mice for erythropoiesis, and Ezh2 KO versus wild type mice in myelopoiesis, revealed which genes show altered transcription, splicing or degradation rates between different conditions. Moreover, we observed that, for some genes, compensatory changes between different rates can result in comparable overall mRNA levels, thereby masking highly dynamic changes in gene expression kinetics in conventional expression analysis. Collectively, we report a robust pipeline for comparative expression analysis based on altered transcriptional kinetics to discover mechanistic differences missed by conventional approaches, with broad applicability across any biomedical research question where single cell expression data are available for both wild type and treatment/mutant conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

The variable loops of the antibody complementarity-determining region (CDR) are particularly crucial for immune responses and therapeutic applications due to their effective target recognition capabilities. Accurate structure prediction of these antibody loops is essential for the efficient in silico design of target-binding antibodies for therapeutic or industrial use. However, predicting antibody loop structures is challenging due to the lack of evolutionary information from related proteins. Thus, a successful ab initio structure prediction method, which operates without structural templates or related sequences, is crucial for the effective design of antibody loop-mediated interactions. This study demonstrates that highly accurate antibody loop structure prediction enables the effective zero-shot design of target-binding antibody loops. The performance of loop design has been shown to depend on the accuracy of ab initio loop structure prediction, as tested with two versions of our design model. The high affinity, diversity, novelty, and specificity of the antibody loops designed with these new methods were validated experimentally on four target proteins.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

However, HMGB1 is less abundant than H1 and binds nucleosomes more weakly raising the question of how HMGB1 effectively competes with H1. Here, we show that HMGB1 rescues H1's inhibition of nucleosomal DNA accessibility without displacing H1. HMGB1 also increases the dynamics of condensed, H1-bound chromatin. Cryo-EM shows that HMGB1 binds at internal locations on a nucleosome and locally distorts the DNA. These sites, which are away from the binding site of H1, explain how HMGB1 and H1 co-occupy a nucleosome. Our findings lead to a model where HMGB1 counteracts the activity of H1 by distorting nucleosomal DNA and by contacting the H1 C-terminal tail. Compared to direct competition, nucleosome co-occupancy by HMGB1 and H1 allows a greater diversity of dynamic chromatin states and may be generalizable to other chromatin regulators.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Dysregulation of insulin signaling in neurons and astrocytes has been implicated in altered mood, cognition, and the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). To define the role of insulin signaling in microglia, the primary phagocytes in brain critical for maintenance and damage repair, we created mice with an inducible microglia-specific insulin receptor knockout (MG-IRKO). RiboTag profiling of microglial mRNAs revealed that loss of insulin signaling results in alterations of gene expression in pathways related to innate immunity and cellular metabolism. In vitro, loss of insulin signaling in microglia results in metabolic reprograming with an increase in glycolysis and impaired uptake of A{beta}. In vivo, MG-IRKO mice exhibit alterations in mood and social behavior, and when crossed with the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, the resultant mice exhibit increased levels of A{beta}; plaque and elevated neuroinflammation. Thus, insulin signaling in microglia plays a key role in microglial cellular metabolism, neuroinflammation and the ability of the cells to take up A{beta}; such that reduced insulin signaling in microglia alters mood and social behavior and accelerates AD pathogenesis. Together these data indicate key roles of insulin action in microglia and the potential of targeting insulin signaling in microglia in treatment of AD.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

However, a common confusion lies in equating the protein structure prediction problem with the protein folding problem. The former provides a static structure, while the latter explains the dynamic folding pathway to that structure. We challenge the current status quo and advocate that AF2 has indeed learned some protein folding principles, despite being designed for structure prediction. AF2's high-dimensional parameters encode an imperfect biophysical scoring function. Typically, AF2 uses multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to guide the search within a narrow region of its learned surface. In our study, we operate AF2 without MSAs or initial templates, forcing it to sample its entire energy landscape - more akin to an ab initio approach. Among over 7,000 proteins, a fraction fold using sequence alone, highlighting the smoothness of AF2's learned energy surface. Additionally, by combining recycling and iterative predictions, we discover multiple AF2 intermediate structures in good agreement with known experimental data. AF2 appears to follow a ""local first, global later"" folding mechanism. For designed proteins with more optimized local interactions, AF2's energy landscape is too smooth to detect intermediates even when it should. Our current work sheds new light on what AF2 has learned and opens exciting possibilities to advance our understanding of protein folding and for experimental discovery of folding intermediates.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

This study aimed to analyse any possible connection between these factors. Methods: The top performing 18 nations from 2012, 2016 and 2020 Olympics (after Russia and Ukraine were excluded) had their relative Gold medals, total medals and medal points (Gold =3, Silver=2, Bronze=1) for Paris 2024 analysed using a backward stepwise linear regression model. Initial input factors included previous medal tallies, home city advantage, time zone effects, national excess deaths 2020-2023, average GDP growth 2020-2023 and number of country signatories to the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD), with factors >P=0.10 removed sequentially. Results: Total medals were best predicted by previous total medals (t=21.0, P<0.001) and home city advantage (t=4.1, P<0.001). Gold medals were best predicted by previous Gold medals (t=10.3, P<0.001), low national excess deaths (t=-3.2, P<0.007) and low signatories to the GBD (t=-2.2, P<0.05). Medal points were best predicted by previous medal points (t=18.1, P<0.001), home city advantage (t=3.2, P<0.007) and low national excess deaths (t=-1.8, P<0.09). Discussion: The Western Pacific countries with a COVID-cautious national perspective (Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea) tended to win more Gold medals than expected in Paris, compared to countries with a COVID-stoical national perspective (e.g. Great Britain, United States) which won fewer Golds than expected. This suggests that a COVID-cautious mentality may have contributed to better performance than a COVID-stoical approach. It is unclear whether any mechanism was physiological (less infectious disease impact before or during the Olympics) or psychological. If this effect existed for Golds, it did not appear to have any effect on Silver and Bronze medals.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177771

Influenzaviruses have been studied mainly in birds but minor in bats. It is unknown whether Chiroptera are reservoirs of influenza viruses. However, circulation in bats showed molecular divergence from H17N10 (Guatemala) and H18N11 (Peru), and they were designated as new subtypes. The study aimed to characterize the influenza A virus detected in the fishing bat Noctilio albiventris. A surveillance study of pathogens of public health interest was carried out; rectal samples were taken from four fishing bats (N. albiventris) captured in Talaigua Nuevo, Bolivar, Colombia. The samples were sequenced by NGS using DNBseq (MGI-G50) and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Eight viral contigs associated with the Orthomyxoviridae family were obtained. The identified segments showed around 90% similarity with H18N11, except for the neuraminidase (N). The phylogenetic analysis of the N protein showed the appearance of a basal branch to the N11 subtype, and the molecular clock indicates that it does not share a recent common ancestor. 3D modeling indicates that the N protein of N. albiventris presents three mutations (K363R, T242K, and I139V) near the hypothetical active site of the protein. These mutations potentially increase the interaction with the HLA-DR of bats, which could have significant implications for the virus's behavior. The phylogenetic, evolutionary, and antigenic divergence of the N protein of N. albiventris suggests a new subtype called H18N12. Its role as a pathogen must be studied.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

While rodent tissue has historically served as a source of these neurons, it has become increasingly clear that pain mechanisms in rodents and humans are substantially divergent. Sensory neurons harvested from cadaveric human tissue serve as a superior translational model for studying pain mechanisms, however their relative paucity limits their widespread utility. Theoretically, sensory neurons manufactured from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) could help bridge this translational gap given their relative abundance and potential similarity to primary human tissue. However, hPSC-derived sensory neurons manufactured with the most common methodologies correlate poorly to human tissue both transcriptionally and functionally. In the present work, we compare a novel population of hPSC-derived sensory neurons to previously published datasets and find this novel population to more closely resemble human primary dorsal root ganglia transcriptionally. Furthermore, we evaluate the heterogeneity of this novel population via single nucleus RNA sequencing and find it resembles specific nociceptor and mechanoreceptor subsets found in vivo. Finally, we assay the functionality of this population with high throughput automated patch clamp electrophysiology with respect to voltage-gated sodium (Nav) and potassium channels (Kv), and ligand-gated ionotropic GABA and P2X receptors. Overall, we find this population of hPSC-derived sensory neurons to be of relatively high fidelity, and suitable for interrogating numerous potential pain targets on a fully humanized platform.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

We generated a comprehensive map of CHD1-9-specific binding proteins, revealing dozens of novel interactions with transcription regulators. We identified APR regions that contribute to PPI formation and demonstrated that a highly conserved APR within the C-terminus of CHD4 is critical for its interaction with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD), as well as the CHD, ADNP, and HP1 (ChAHP) complexes. Further analysis unravels a regulatory role for the CHD4 APR in gene transcription during erythrocyte formation.

Diffusive generation of latent molecular encodings, rather than direct diffusive generation of molecular structures, offers an appealing way to handle the small and mismatched datasets that are common for molecular properties. We benchmark various diffusion guidance schemes and sampling methods against a pre-trained autoregressive transformer and genetic algorithms to evaluate control over potency, expert preference, and various physicochemical properties. We show that conditional diffusion allows control over the properties of generated molecules, with practical and performance advantages over competing methods. We also apply the recently introduced idea of particle guidance to enhance sample diversity. We prospectively survey a panel of medicinal chemists and determine that we can conditionally generate molecules that align with their preferences via a learned preference score.

Academic publishers are adapting to the transformative role of AI chatbots in producing or facilitating scientific research. This study aimed to examine the policies established by scientific, technical, and medical academic publishers for defining and regulating the responsible authors use of AI chatbots.

MethodsThis study performed a cross-sectional audit on the publicly available policies of 163 academic publishers, indexed as members of the International Association of the Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers (STM). Data extraction of publicly available policies on the webpages of all STM academic publishers was performed independently in duplicate with content analysis reviewed by a third contributor (September 2023 - December 2023). Data was categorized into policy elements, such as  proofreading and  image generation. Counts and percentages of  yes (i.e., permitted),  no, and  N/A were established for each policy element.

ResultsA total of 56/163 (34.4%) STM academic publishers had a publicly available policy guiding the authors use of AI chatbots. No policy allowed authorship accreditations for AI chatbots (or other generative technology). Most (49/56 or 87.5%) required specific disclosure of AI chatbot use. Four policies/publishers placed a complete ban on the use of AI tools by authors.

ConclusionsOnly a third of STM academic publishers had publicly available policies as of December 2023. A re-examination of all STM members in 12-18 months may uncover evolving approaches toward AI chatbot use with more academic publishers having a policy.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177771

Recent work, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to induce virtual lesions, has illustrated a key role of the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) in the detection and resolution of perceptual ambiguities. Here, we sought to validate an active role of the IFC in conscious perception by evaluating how loss-of-function in patients with ischemic stroke in this region influences processing of ambiguous visual information. To this end, twenty-three patients (11 female, mean age 70.65 {+/-} 1.2 yrs) with chronic (>6 months), right-hemispheric ischemic stroke lesions within the MCA-territory (9 patients with IFC lesions, 14 without) performed a bistable perception task, having to report the perceived direction of rotation of an ambiguous random-dot-kinematogram (RDK). As hypothesized, patients with IFC lesions showed significantly fewer perceptual changes compared to patients without IFC lesions (IFC 44.9 {+/-} 46.3 s, non-IFC 28.2 {+/-} 37.1 s, T(182.9) = 3.1, p = 2.2 x 10-3). Importantly, this effect remained significant when controlling for age, sex, stroke severity and lesion volume (T(5.97) = -2.9, p =0.026). Our results support the notion that the IFC is crucial for resolving perceptual ambiguities, suggesting an active role of frontal cortex in shaping conscious visual experience.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Coherent cerebrovascular oscillation that couples with pulsatile CSF inflow is suggested to drive the fluid flux. However, how this coupling is regulated, whether it mediates waste clearance, and why fluid flux is impaired in disease status remain unclear. Here we show that vascular-CSF coupling correlates with cortical cholinergic activity in non-demented aged humans. The causal role of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the cortex is then verified by specific lesioning in mice, revealing correlated changes in vascular-CSF coupling, arterial pulsation and glymphatic flux, which can be altered by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. These results suggest a neurovascular mechanism by which CSF/glymphatic flux is modulated by cholinergic neuronal activity, thereby providing a conceptual basis for the development of diagnostics and treatments for glymphatic dysfunction.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Here, we present the systematic workflow of designing, implementing, and testing versatile Escherichia coli metabolic sensor strains. Glyoxylate, a key metabolite in (synthetic) CO2 fixation and carbon-conserving pathways, served as the test molecule. Through iterative screening of a compact metabolic model, we identified non-trivial growth-coupled designs that resulted in six metabolic sensors with a wide sensitivity range for glyoxylate, spanning three orders of magnitude in detected concentrations. We further adapted these E. coli strains for sensing glycolate and demonstrated their utility in both pathway engineering (testing a key metabolic module via glyoxylate) and applications in environmental monitoring (quantifying glycolate produced by photosynthetic microalgae). The versatility and ease of implementation of this workflow make it suitable for designing and building multiple metabolic sensors for diverse biotechnological applications.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

These compounds have applications in medicine, biotechnology, and agriculture. Their production is encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), groups of genes collectively directing their biosynthesis. The advent of metagenomics has allowed researchers to study BGCs directly from environmental samples, identifying numerous previously unknown BGCs encoding unprecedented chemistry. Here, we present the BGC Atlas (bgc-atlas.cs.uni-tuebingen.de), a web resource that facilitates the exploration and analysis of BGC diversity in metagenomes. The BGC Atlas identifies and clusters BGCs from publicly available datasets, offering a centralized database and a web interface for metadata-aware exploration of BGCs and gene cluster families (GCFs). We analyzed over 35,000 datasets from MGnify, identifying nearly 1.8 million BGCs, which were clustered into GCFs. The analysis showed that ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) are the most abundant compound class, with most GCFs exhibiting high environmental specificity. We believe that our tool will enable researchers to easily explore and analyze the BGC diversity in environmental samples, significantly enhancing our understanding of bacterial secondary metabolites, and promote the identification of ecological and evolutionary factors shaping the biosynthetic potential of microbial communities.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Whether people without severe disease can also develop strong neutralizing responses to infection, and the pathways involved, is less clear. We performed a proteomic analysis on sera from 71 individuals infected with ancestral SARS-CoV-2, enrolled during the first South African infection wave. We determined disease severity by whether participants required supplemental oxygen and measured neutralizing antibody levels at convalescence. High neutralizing antibodies were associated with high disease severity, yet 40% of participants with lower disease severity had neutralizing antibody levels comparable to those with severe disease. We found 130 differentially expressed proteins between high and low neutralizers and 40 between people with high versus low disease severity. Five proteins overlapped, including furin, a protease which enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection. High neutralizers with non-severe disease had similar levels of differentially expressed neutralization response proteins to high neutralizers with severe disease, yet similar levels of differentially expressed disease severity proteins to participants with non-severe disease. Furthermore, we could reasonably predict who developed a strong neutralizing response based on a single protein, HSPA8, involved in clathrin pit uncoating.

Combined with reverse transcription-droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) detection, the method provides a fast and sensitive method for measuring viral RNA concentrations in wastewater. The method was used to measure the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in daily samples of wastewater entering a major metropolitan wastewater treatment plant over the course of 32 months, from November 2020 through June 2023. In addition, targeted mutation assays were used with RT-ddPCR to characterize the evolving presence and prevalence of specific SARS-CoV-2 variant sub-lineages in the wastewater stream over time. The results demonstrate the utility of these methods to accurately measure the total load of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and chronicle its evolving variant composition, in wastewater treatment plant influent, providing near-real-time characterization of COVID-19 disease prevalence and trends in the served community.

Our analysis focused on terminal glycan epitopes with immunomodulatory functions, including sialoglycan ligands for Siglecs. We demonstrate that glycosylation patterns are diverse across the resting murine T cell repertoire and dynamically remodelled in response to antigen-specific stimulation. Surprisingly, we find that human T cell populations do not share the same glycoprofiles or glycan remodelling dynamics as their murine counterparts. We show that these differences can be explained by divergent regulation of glycan biosynthesis pathways between the species. These results highlight fundamental glycophysiological differences between mouse and human T cells and reveal features that are critical to consider for glycan-targeted therapies.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Eleven species were recorded for the first time in Caraj&aacutes. Species richness varied among environments - forests being the richest - but cangas had greater richness stability and a more distinct species composition. All areas with imminent mining had high bat richness. Richness in a post-mined area increased, possibly indicating resilience of some species.

The regulatory logic of differentiation includes factors specific to one or multiple cell types, functioning in a combinatorial fashion. Classic approaches of GRN discovery used perturbational data to elucidate TF-TG links, but are laborious and not scalable across the tree of life. Single cell transcriptomics has emerged as a revolutionary approach to study gene expression with cell type resolution, but incorporating perturbational data is challenging. Planarians, with their pluripotent neoblast stem cells continuously giving rise to all cell types, offer an ideal model to attempt this integration. Despite extensive single cell transcriptomic studies, the transcriptional and chromatin regulation at the cell type level remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation by obtaining an organism-level integration of single cell transcriptomics and single cell accessibility data. We identify specific open chromatin profiles for major differentiated cell types and analyse their transcriptomic landscape, revealing distinct gene modules expressed in individual types and combinations of them. Integrated analysis unveils gene networks reflecting known TF interactions in each type and identifies TFs potentially driving differentiation across multiple cell types. To validate our predictions, we combined TF knockdown RNAi experiments with single cell transcriptomics. We focus on hnf4, a TF known to be expressed in gut phagocytes, and confirm its influence on other types, including parenchymal cells. Our results demonstrate high overlap between predicted targets and experimentally-validated differentially-regulated genes. Overall, our study integrates TFs, TGs and OCRs to reveal the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell differentiation, showcasing that the combination of single cell methods and perturbational studies will be key for characterising GRNs widely.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Four AFP types have convergently evolved in several fish lineages. AFPs inhibit ice crystal growth and lower cellular freezing point. In lineages with AFPs, species inhabiting colder environments may possess more AFP copies. Elucidating how interspecific differences in AFP copy number evolve is challenging due to the genes' tandem array structure and consequently poor resolution of these repetitive regions. Here we explore the evolution of type III AFPs (AFP III) in the globally distributed suborder Zoarcoidei, leveraging six new long-read genome assemblies. Zoarcoidei has fewer genomic resources relative to other polar fish clades while it is one of the few groups of fishes adapted to both the Arctic and Southern Oceans. Combining these new assemblies with additional long-read genomes available for Zoarcoidei, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic test of AFP III evolution and modeled the effects of thermal habitat and depth on AFP III gene family evolution. We confirm a single origin of AFP III via neofunctionalization of the enzyme sialic acid synthase B and show that AFP gains and losses were not only correlated with temperature, but also with depth, which reduces freezing via pressure. Associations between the environment and AFP III copy number were driven by duplications of paralogs that were translocated out of the ancestral locus at which Zoarcoidei AFP arose. Our results reveal novel environmental effects on AFP evolution and demonstrate the value of high-quality genomic resources for studying how structural genomic variation shapes convergent adaptation.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

We also examined correlations between the presence of SNPs with each other, with subvariants, and over time.

ResultsSeventy-nine mutations met inclusion criteria.

MethodsParticipants had three study visits separated by 2-7 days, according to a randomized, single-blind, cross-over, controlled design: (1) a 30-minute period of coached singing from an in-person music therapist, (2) a 30-minute period of singing along to an instructional video and (3) a 30-minute rest (control). Primary outcomes included macrovascular endothelial function assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and microvascular function assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (Framingham reactive hyperemia index; fRHI). Heart rate variability was a secondary outcome.

ResultsSixty-five subjects (mean age 67.7{+/-} 0.8, 40% women) completed the study. Compared to control, there was an increase in fRHI for the singing video intervention (estimate 0.54, SE 0.25, p=0.005) but not for the coaching intervention (estimate 0.11, SE 0.18, p=0.570). There was no change in macrovascular function with either intervention. The low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio increased by 2.80 (SE 1.03, p=0.008), and the LnHF power decreased by -0.90 ms2 (SE 0.29, p=0.003) with the video (during to pre-change).

However, the developmental hierarchy between mesodermal progenitors, endothelium, and blood cell lineages is incompletely understood. We report here the identification in mouse gastrula and human (h)iPSC cultures of a population of CXCR4+ primitive streak stage mesodermal progenitors that give rise to yolk sac endothelium, blood islands, yolk sac hematopoiesis, and resident macrophages, corresponding to the pro-definitive lineage. Strikingy, this progenitor does not give rise to primitive erythropoiesis or to caudal endothelium and definitive hematopoiesis. Interestingly however, the pro-definitive progenitor population also gives rise to rostral endothelium that persists in adults. Finally, pro-definitive progenitor- derived endothelium is the first and main source of macrophages in embryo and hiPSC cultures, both directly and via previously described multipotent Erythro-Myeloid Progenitors. The identification and isolation of this mesodermal progenitor defines a revised pro-definitive angio-hematopoietic lineage and provides a framework for resident macrophage and endothelial differentiation relevant to disease pathophysiology and their manipulation for therapeutic purposes.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

We investigated the summiting disease caused by the fungus Entomophthora muscae in houseflies, where infected flies climb to elevated positions and die, releasing infectious conidia. We performed dual-RNA sequencing of fly heads at different time points and identified candidate genes from both the host and the pathogen that may be involved in this summiting phenotype. Surprisingly, we also detected an extremely high abundance of a novel positive sense single-stranded (+ss) RNA Iflavirus in infected fly heads. We show that the virus load increases over time and shows signs of accumulation in fly heads and thoraces. We also reveal predicted interactions between fungal secreted proteins and insect host proteins related to neurological and immune functions, suggesting a possible role of these proteins in host manipulation. Furthermore, we find that E. muscae encodes a homologue of ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase (egt), a gene that has been implicated in host manipulation by other pathogens. Our study reveals a complex interplay between a fungus, a virus and a fly, and suggests that convergent evolution of egt for host manipulation mechanisms may occur in different pathogens.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Meristems develop in all land plants, however we know relatively little about the spatial and temporal regulation of meristem structure in lineages such as the bryophytes. Here we describe the three-dimensional anatomy of the meristem during the development of the liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha. Using optical reconstructions of the frontal, sagittal and transverse planes through the mature meristem, we show that the apical stem cell is sub-apical, ventral, and located in the outer cell layer. The anatomy of the mature meristem is therefore asymmetrical in the dorsoventral axis, which is reflected by the domain specific protein localisation of Marchantia Class III and Class IV Homeodomain-Leucine-Zippers (MpC3HDZ and MpC4HDZ) and promoter activity of MpYUCCA2. The dorsoventral asymmetry that defines the mature meristem is absent in the juvenile meristems of the asexual propagules known as gemmae. We discovered that anatomical dorsoventral asymmetry of the meristem forms after two days of gemmaling growth and is accompanied by expression of the dorsal identity reporter, MpC3HDZ. We conclude that the gemma meristem is in a state of arrested development and undergoes anatomical rearrangement to develop the three-dimensional meristem structure of the mature plant.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Here in the model plant Arabidopsis, we show that CCR4, the catalytic subunit of the RNA deadenylation complex CCR4-NOT, is essential for maintenance of the centromere epigenome and chromosome integrity. We demonstrate that CCR4 is involved in shortening of the poly(A) tails of transcripts originated from centromeric transposons and repeats, thereby promoting the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The CCR4-dependent siRNAs guide non-CG DNA methylation at centromere repeats, and CCR4 cooperates with canonical DNA methylation pathways to enhance centromeric H3K9 methylation and ensure mitotic chromosome stability.

Here, we determine the detailed 3D architecture of corpuscular components and reveal their contribution to touch detection. We show that the outer core is dispensable for rapid adaptation and frequency tuning. Instead, these properties arise from the inner core, composed of gap junction-coupled lamellar Schwann cells (LSCs) surrounding the afferent terminal. By acting as additional touch sensing structures, LSCs potentiate mechanosensitivity of the terminal, which detects touch via fast-inactivating ion channels. We propose a model in which Pacinian corpuscle function is mediated by an interplay between mechanosensitive LSCs and the afferent terminal in the inner core.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

We prompted 4 LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, Stanford Medicine Secure GPT (GPT-4.0)) with a set of 38 prompts consisting of explicit questions and synthetic clinical notes created by medically trained reviewers and LGBTQIA+ health experts. The prompts explored clinical situations across two axes: (i) situations where historical bias has been observed vs. not observed, and (ii) situations where LGBTQIA+ identity is relevant to clinical care vs. not relevant. Medically trained reviewers evaluated LLM responses for appropriateness (safety, privacy, hallucination/accuracy, and bias) and clinical utility. We find that all 4 LLMs evaluated generated inappropriate responses to our prompt set. LLM performance is strongly hampered by learned anti-LGBTQIA+ bias and over-reliance on the mentioned conditions in prompts. Given these results, future work should focus on tailoring output formats according to stated use cases, decreasing sycophancy and reliance on extraneous information in the prompt, and improving accuracy and decreasing bias for LGBTQIA+ patients and care providers.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177771

To address this challenge, we introduce ActSort, an active-learning algorithm for sorting large-scale datasets that integrates features engineered by domain experts together with data formats with minimal memory requirements. By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1-3% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithms widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations. Our tests validated ActSorts performance across different experimental conditions and datasets from multiple animals. Overall, ActSort addresses a crucial bottleneck in processing large-scale calcium videos of neural activity and thereby facilitates systems neuroscience experiments at previously inaccessible scales.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Our findings reveal cell- and region-specific changes within the stroke-injured and peri-infarct brain tissue. For instance, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exhibited upregulated genes in signaling pathways involved in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, and downregulated pathways associated with aerobic metabolism. Using cell-cell communication analysis, we identified increased strength in predicted interactions within stroke tissue among both neural and non-neural cells via signaling pathways such as those involving collagen, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor, neuronal growth regulator, laminin, and several cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between mouse transcriptome responses after stroke and those observed in human nonfatal brain stroke lesions.

Despite the increased prevalence of experimental studies that interrogate this phenomenon, there remains a lack of applicable quantitative tools to characterise data, and importantly to distinguish between resistance as a discrete phenotype and a (potentially heterogeneous) continuous distribution of phenotypes. To address this, we develop a stochastic individual-based model of adaptive resistance in low-cell-count proliferation assays. That our model corresponds probabilistically to common partial differential equation models of resistance allows us to formulate a likelihood that captures the intrinsic noise ubiquitous to such experiments. We apply our framework to assess the identifiability of key model parameters in several population-level data collection regimes; in particular, parameters relating to the adaptation velocity and within-population heterogeneity. Significantly, we find that heterogeneity is practically non-identifiable from both cell count and proliferation marker data, implying that population-level behaviours may be well characterised by homogeneous ordinary differential equation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that population-level data are insufficient to distinguish resistance as a discrete phenotype from a continuous distribution of phenotypes. Our results inform the design of both future experiments and future quantitative analyses that probe adaptive resistance in cancer.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Our study reveals that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+ nociceptors reduced survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV), despite no significant changes in viral burden or weight loss. Mice lacking nociceptors showed exacerbated lung pathology and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The increased mortality was not attributable to the loss of the TRPV1 ion channel or neuropeptides CGRP or substance P. Immune profiling through flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing identified significant nociceptor deficiency-mediated changes in the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in these myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil sub-populations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, anti-GR1-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection significantly improved survival, underscoring a role of nociceptors in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.

Unexpectedly, decreases in brain volume and thickness, which are widely thought to underlie cognitive changes in humans 5 did not predict well the trajectory of neural activity or cognitive performance changes. Whole brain cortical volume in particular, exhibited an increase and reached a local maximum in late adolescence, at a time of rapid behavioral improvement. Maturation of long-distance white matter tracts linking the frontal lobe with areas of the association cortex and subcortical regions best predicted changes in neuronal activity and behavior. Our results provide evidence that optimization of neural activity depending on widely distributed circuitry effects cognitive development in adolescence.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

"A counterfactual analysis quantifying the COVID-19 vaccination impact in Sweden","10.1101/2024.08.22.24312361","medrxiv",9,3,9,9,9,"Bergstrom, F.; Gunther, F.; Britton, T.","Fanny Bergstrom","Stockholm University","2024-08-23","1","PUBLISHAHEADOFPRINT","cc_by_nc","infectious diseases","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/early/2024/08/23/2024.08.22.24312361.source.xml","BackgroundVaccination was the single most effective measure in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to quantify the impact of vaccination programmes during this initial year of vaccination by estimating the number of case fatalities avoided, having Sweden as a case study.

MethodsUsing Swedish data on age-specific reported incidence, vaccination uptake, and contact structures, along with age-specific estimates on the vaccine efficacies and under-reporting from the literature, we fit a Bayesian SEIR epidemic model with time-varying community contact rate {beta}(t) for COVID-19 incidence. By adding age-specific infection fatality rates, we obtain an estimate of about 5,540 (95% PI: 5,390-5,690) for the number of case fatalities from the fitted model. This estimate aligns closely with the reported 5,430 case fatalities during the same period. We then use the estimated contact rate {beta}(t) in a counterfactual analysis where the population is unvaccinated, leading to more infections and fatalities.

FindingsThe counterfactual analysis result in a severe epidemic outbreak during the early autumn of 2021, resulting in about 52,600 (49,900-55,500) number of case fatalities. Consequently, the number of lives saved by the vaccination program is estimated to be about 47,100 (44,500-49,800), out of which 6,460 are directly saved and 40,600 are indirectly saved, mainly by drastically reducing the severe outbreak in the early autumn of 2021, which would have occurred without vaccination and unchanged community contact rate.

InterpretationOur mathematical model is used to analyze the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on lives saved in Sweden during 2021, but the same methodology can be applied to other countries. The counterfactual analysis offers insights into an alternative trajectory of the pandemic without vaccination. By incorporating estimated vaccination-related parameters, age-specific infection fatality ratio and under-reporting, our model estimates the number of case fatalities avoided. The results not only show the direct impact of vaccination on reducing deaths for infected individuals but also shed light on the indirect effects of reduced transmission dynamics.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSVaccination against COVID-19 has been proven to reduce infection rates, hospitalizations, and mortality. Observational studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy COVID-19 vaccines, and mathematical modeling studies have been conducted to predict the potential outcomes of vaccination programmes under different scenarios. These models have provided insights into the benefits of achieving high vaccination coverage and the consequences of delays or interruptions in vaccine distribution. There remains a gap in analyses that quantify the impact of the vaccination programme in Sweden by comparing actual outcomes with a scenario without vaccination. This study aims to fill this gap by employing a robust counterfactual analysis method to provide a clearer picture of the COVID-19 vaccination impact in Sweden. This approach offers a understanding of the impact of vaccination by isolating the effects of the vaccination from other interventions. For our literature review, we have searched PubMed for ""vaccination counterfactual analysis"", ""SEIR model vaccination impact"", ""quantifying effect of COVID-19 vaccination"" and ""COVID-19 IFR"". The Swedish Public Health Agency has provided country-specific data for Sweden.

Added value of this studyThe Bayesian SEIR model presented in this paper provides a flexible and data-driven framework to assess the effectiveness of vaccination strategies. Using age- and country-specific data and parameters on reported cases, under-reporting and infection fatality rate (IFR), we can quantify the effect of vaccination in Sweden 2021. This study compares the case fatalities in a factual analysis with a counterfactual analysis, which has the same contact rates but with a unvaccinated population. The comparison allows an estimate of the number of lives saved from the vaccination. The methodology can be used to evaluate the effect of vaccination in other countries, but also for other counterfactual scenarios such as different vaccination schemes.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings highlight the critical role of vaccination in mitigating COVID-19-related mortality. Through the counterfactual analysis provided by the SEIR epidemic model, we gain insights into the effects of vaccination programmes. Beyond reducing deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 infection vaccination also exerts a broader societal impact by curbing transmission rates and easing strain on healthcare systems. Moreover, by quantifying the number of lives saved through vaccination efforts, we offer policymakers and public health officials invaluable data for optimizing future vaccination strategies and reinforcing the importance of widespread vaccine uptake. The insights gained from this study not only show the effectiveness of vaccination in saving lives but also provide a robust framework of a data-driven approach to guide evidence-based decision-making and shaping vaccination policies.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177771

As durophagous mammals, southern sea otters exhibit significant ontogenetic changes in cranial and mandibular morphology to presumably enable them to feed on a variety of hard-shelled invertebrate prey. However, how quickly juvenile otters reach sufficient maturity in biting performances remained unknown. Here, I found that theoretical bite force of southern sea otters does not reach full maturity until during the adult stage at 3.6 and 5.0 years of age in females and males, respectively. The slow maturation of biting performance can be directly attributed to the slow growth and development of the cranium and the primary jaw adductor muscle (i.e., the temporalis) and may ultimately impact the survival of newly weaned juveniles by limiting their ability to process certain hard-shelled prey. Alterative foraging behaviors such as tool use, however, may mitigate the disadvantages of delayed maturation of biting performance. In analyses of sexual dimorphism, I found that growth in male bite force enables them to quickly reach sufficient biting performances needed to process prey early in life. This is followed by a slower growth phase towards bite force maturation that coincides with sexual maturity, thus enabling them to compete with other males for resources and mates. Overall, this study demonstrates how the analysis of anatomical data can provide insight on the foraging ecologies and life histories of sea otters across ontogeny.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177771

Thus far, only a limited number of Clade I MPXV genomes have been characterized, and they are not representative across different regions and time periods.

MethodsWe conducted whole genome sequencing of 603 mpox-positive samples that were collected from 581 patients between 2018-2024 in 17/26 provinces of the DRC.

ResultsGenome coverage was at least 70% for 423/603 (70.1%) samples and near full-length MPXV genomes (>90% coverage) were obtained for 348/603 (57.7%) samples. All newly generated MPXV sequences belonged to Clade I, among which 17 were Clade Ib strains, all from patients infected in 2024 in the South-Kivu province. The large majority (95%) of the new strains fall within previously described Clade Ia groups and potential new groups have also been observed. Genetically diverse MPXV lineages co-circulate in small geographic areas during the same outbreak suggesting multiple zoonotic introductions over a short period from one or multiple reservoir species. The low number of APOBEC3 mutations found among Clade Ia suggests that most human mpox cases are probably linked to zoonotic transmissions. Recent identification of mpox cases in Kinshasa shows multiple virus lineages being present within a large urban center.

ConclusionThe mpox epidemic in the DRC exhibits two distinct patterns. In traditional endemic regions, the epidemic in DRC is predominated by zoonotic spillover events involving Clade Ia. Conversely, in the eastern part of the country, the Clade Ib outbreak is driven by human-to-human transmission highlighting the need for a coordinated response effort at the national, regional and international levels.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177772

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 (JN.1.11.1.2) and KP.3 (JN.1.11.1.3), which acquired additional S substitutions e.g., S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Thereafter, JN.1 subvariants, such as LB.1 (JN.1.9.2.1), KP.2.3 (JN.1.11.1.2.3), and KP.3.1.1 (JN.1.11.1.3.1.1), which convergently acquired a deletion of Serine at the 31st position in S (S:S31del) in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. We recently reported the virological features of JN.1 subvariants including KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3.2,3 Here, we investigated the virological properties of KP.3.1.1. First, we estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3.1.1 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model4 based on genome surveillance data from Spain, the USA, France, Canada, and the UK, where this variant has spread as of June 2024. In Spain, the Re of KP.3.1.1 is over 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and even higher than those of KP.2, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3. Additionally, the other countries under investigation herein show higher Re for KP.3.1.1. However, it must be noted there is the possibility of overestimation in these countries due to more limited KP.3.1.1 sequence numbers. These results suggest that KP.3.1.1 will spread worldwide along with other JN.1 sublineages. We then assessed the virological properties of KP.3.1.1 using pseudoviruses. The pseudovirus of KP.3.1.1 had significantly higher infectivity than that of KP.3. Neutralization of KP.3.1.1 was tested using i) convalescent sera after breakthrough infection (BTI) with XBB.1.5 or EG.5, ii) convalescent sera after the infection with HK.3 or JN.1, and iii) sera after monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination. The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) against KP.3.1.1 was significantly lower than KP.3 (1.4-1.6-fold) in all four groups of convalescent sera tested. KP.3.1.1 also showed a 1.3-fold lower NT50 against XBB.1.5 vaccine sera than KP.3. Moreover, KP.3.1.1 showed stronger resistance with a 1.3-fold lower NT50 with statistical significances to the convalescent sera infected with EG.5 and HK.3 than KP.2.3. Altogether, KP.3.1.1 exhibited a higher Re, higher pseudovirus infectivity, and higher neutralization evasion than KP.3. These results align with our recent report that the JN.1 subvariants with S:S31del (e.g., KP.2.3 and LB.1) exhibited enhanced Re and immune evasion compared to the other JN.1 subvariants without S:S31del (e.g., JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3), highlighting the evolutionary significance of S:S31del in the JN.1 lineages.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Such studies face the central difficulty of distinguishing possible causal influences, in particular genetic and non-genetic ones. When confounding between possible influences is not rigorously addressed, it invites over- and misinterpretation of data. We illustrate the breadth of this problem through a discussion of the literature and a reanalysis of two examples. Clark (2023) suggested that patterns of similarity in social status between relatives indicate that social status is largely determined by ones DNA. We show that the papers conclusions are based on the conflation of genetic and non-genetic transmission, such as wealth, within families. Song & Zhang (2024) posited that genetic variants underlying bisexual behavior are maintained in the population because they also affect risk-taking behavior, thereby conferring an evolutionary fitness advantage through increased sexual promiscuity. In this case, too, we show that possible explanations cannot be distinguished, but only one is chosen and presented as a conclusion. We discuss how issues of confounding apply more broadly to studies that claim to establish genetic underpinnings to human behavior and societal outcomes.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Despite its importance, conducting manual experiments with individual fruit flies can be challenging and time-consuming, especially for studies of individual fly behaviors. Such studies often involve cumbersome preparatory steps, such as manually tethering a fly and then positioning it within an experimental setup1,2. These procedures commonly require the fly to be anesthetized, and, before behavioral assessments begin, the fly must recover from anesthesia. Hence, the introduction of automated phenotyping and behavioral assays would expedite important aspects of fly research, by minimizing manual handling of flies and decreasing the net time needed for experiments. Here, we introduce FlyMAX (Fly Manipulation and Autonomous eXperimentation), an autonomous robotic system for manipulating adult flies without use of anesthesia. FlyMAX collects individual flies from a standard vial, analyzes them with computer vision, and achieves a throughput of >1,000 flies per day for high-throughput inspection and characterization assays. Robotic handling had no detectable adverse effects on fly longevity or our assessments of fly health. Moreover, the behavioral performance of flies, especially of males, was better and less variable than of flies handled manually. Our system employs deep learning-based machine vision for real-time assessments of picking quality and fly phenotypes. This enables fully pipelined, autonomous experimentation for behavioral assays with individual flies in controlled environments, which was previously infeasible. Overall, FlyMAX constitutes a promising technology to enhance the efficiency and reproducibility of research with flies and other insects in fields such as genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Multiple p-tau biomarkers on several analytical platforms are poised for clinical use. The Alzheimers Association Global Biomarker Standardisation Consortium plasma phospho-tau Round Robin study engaged assay developers in a blinded case-control study on plasma p-tau, aiming to learn which assays provide the largest fold-changes in AD compared to non-AD, have the strongest relationship between plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and show the most consistent relationships between methods (commutability) in measuring both patient samples and candidate reference materials (CRM).

METHODSThirty-three different p-tau biomarker assays, built on eight different analytical platforms, were used to quantify paired plasma and CSF samples from 40 participants. AD biomarker status was categorised as ""AD pathology"" (n=25) and ""non-AD pathology"" (n=15) by CSF A{beta}42/A{beta}40 (US-FDA; CE-IVDR) and p-tau181 (CE-IVDR) methods. The commutability of four CRM, at three concentrations, was assessed across assays.

FINDINGSPlasma p-tau217 consistently demonstrated higher fold-changes between AD and non-AD pathology groups, compared to other p-tau epitopes. Fujirebio LUMIPULSE G, UGOT IPMS, and Lilly MSD p-tau217 assays provided the highest median fold-changes. In CSF, p-tau217 assays also performed best, and exhibited substantially larger fold-changes than their plasma counterparts, despite similar diagnostic performance. P-tau217 showed the strongest correlations between plasma assays (rho=0.81 to 0.97). Plasma p-tau levels were weakly-to-moderately correlated with CSF p-tau, and correlations were non-significant within the AD group alone. The evaluated CRM were not commutable across assays.

INTERPRETATIONPlasma p-tau217 measures had larger fold-changes and discriminative accuracies for detecting AD pathology, and better agreement across platforms than other plasma p-tau variants. Plasma and CSF markers of p-tau, measured by immunoassays, are not substantially correlated, questioning the interchangeability of their continuous relationship. Further work is warranted to understand the pathophysiology underlying this dissociation, and to develop suitable reference materials facilitating cross-assay standardisation.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPhosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid is an established biomarker of Alzheimers disease (AD), and several studies of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers now show evidence for its diagnostic accuracy in AD. We reviewed the literature on plasma p-tau in AD by searching without language restrictions in PubMed for articles from 1st January 2014 to 1st March 2024 using the terms (((""Alzheimer Disease""[Mesh]) OR ((Alzheimer[Title/Abstract]) OR (Alzheimers [Title/Abstract))) AND (((""Blood""[Mesh]) OR (""Plasma""[Mesh])) OR (plasma[Title/Abstract]))) AND ((phospho tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (phosphorylated tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (p-tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (P-tau[Title/Abstract]) OR (pTau[Title/Abstract])), filtering for studies in humans. Several studies examined plasma p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231 in well-characterised research cohorts including cognitively impaired and unimpaired individuals, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy when utilising CSF or amyloid PET imaging ""gold standard"" biomarkers, and in relation to post-mortem amyloid and tau pathology. Most studies utilised single-method assays to measure biomarkers of interest, including immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and a variety of immunochemical methods including single molecule array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, electrochemiluminescence, and immunomagnetic reduction. Some later studies have performed cross-method and cross-phospho-form comparisons (p-tau181, p-tau217 and p-tau231), including six single molecular array assays in the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, nine assays in the BIODEGMAR memory clinic-based cohort from Spain, ten assays in individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the Sk[a]ne University memory clinic cohort from Sweden, and have generally reported the various individual methods for p-tau217 to have the highest diagnostic accuracy for the presence of cerebral {beta}-amyloid deposition. No study to date has compared assays for p-tau217 on semi- and fully automated platforms, described comparisons with p-tau212 and p-tau205 in plasma, or assessed commutability of candidate reference materials between assays in comparison to patient samples.

Added value of this studyOur study included the largest number of methods for assaying plasma p-tau to date, with engagement from 12 assay developers, allowing for blinded cross-assay comparisons of 33 plasma assays (for p-tau181, p-tau205, p-tau212, p-tau217, and p-tau231). Among these were included several semi-automated and fully automated methods that have potential for widespread clinical application. This is also the first study, to our knowledge, in which the commutability of candidate reference materials was assessed for plasma p-tau, as a first step in efforts to standardise between assays. The study design capitalised on a large volume of paired CSF and plasma drawn from well-characterised attenders to a specialist cognitive disorders service, allowing for 26 intra-method comparisons between CSF and plasma measurements within the same individuals. We found that CSF p-tau217 assays consistently outperformed other CSF p-tau assays in terms of fold-change between individuals with and without Alzheimers pathology, and the top ten assays in terms of fold change in plasma were also p-tau217 assays. This high discriminative value of plasma p-tau217 contrasted with overall only moderate correlations between CSF and plasma within individuals, which did not persist within the AD group alone. We also did not observe commutability of the four types of candidate reference materials we investigated, for any of the assay pairs.

Implications of all the available evidenceOur study adds to the growing evidence for plasma p-tau217 as a candidate biomarker for translation into clinical practice by virtue of its superior discriminative ability between AD vs non-AD in symptomatic individuals, when compared head-to-head with other phosphorylated tau forms. The observed high and clinically interpretable fold-changes are pivotal for this biomarkers possible future success. Further studies should examine whether blood biomarker-supported diagnosis will extend access to disease-specific (and potentially disease-modifying) treatments and impact patient-relevant outcomes such as quality of life, particularly in diverse and resource-limited settings. Standardization between different assays will also be important for real-world applications, and this will require further concerted efforts in developing reference materials.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177772

This is variously interpreted as speed/accuracy, fast/slow, or impulsivity/deliberateness tradeoffs according to different models of behaviour1-5. Regardless, it is generally assumed that decision latency reflects the neural mechanisms underlying behavioural strategy and cognitive investment. However, such investigations have been difficult in mice which are consistently impulsive. Here, we show that manipulating cost, using a novel floating-platform paradigm, overcomes the natural impulsivity of mice, more closely matching human behaviour. Furthermore, this approach allowed us simultaneously to measure the flow of activity from medial to lateral frontal cortex (MFC[-&gt;]LFC) and record sequences of single neuron activity with 2-photon imaging. Surprisingly, MFC display a different mode of operation, with high vulnerability to optical inhibition compared to LFC. Furthermore, the balance in choice coding at the beginning of sequences in MFC correlated with trial history and behavioural strategy. We found that for optimal performance, slow sequences in MFC showed declining numbers of active neurons whereas the opposite was true in LFC. Our results suggest that while LFC acts as an integrative motor threshold, MFC plays a larger cognitive role in the selection and timing of decisions than previously thought. Our study offers a methodological and mechanistic framework in mouse frontal cortex to understand the neural basis of voluntary decision making.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Here we engineered, characterized, and validated the first genetically encoded biosensors for polyamines, named iPASnFRs. We demonstrate the utility of iPASnFR for detecting polyamine import into mammalian cells, to the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and the nucleus. We demonstrate that these sensors are useful to probe the activity of polyamine transporters and to uncover biochemical pathways underlying the distribution of polyamines amongst organelles. The sensors powered a high-throughput small molecule compound library screen, revealing multiple compounds in different chemical classes that strongly modulate cellular polyamine levels. These sensors will be powerful tools to investigate the complex interplay between polyamine uptake and metabolic pathways, address open questions about their role in health and disease, and enable screening for therapeutic polyamine modulators.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Here, we use a meta-scoring approach to develop a metaPRS for T2D that incorporated genome-wide associations from both European and non-European genetic ancestries and T2D risk factors. We evaluated the performance of this metaPRS and benchmarked it against existing genome-wide PRS in 620,059 participants and 50,572 T2D cases amongst six diverse genetic ancestries from UK Biobank, INTERVAL, the All of Us Research Program, and the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort. We show that our metaPRS was the most powerful PRS for predicting T2D in European population-based cohorts and had comparable performance to the top ancestry-specific PRS, highlighting its transferability. In UK Biobank, we show the metaPRS had stronger predictive power for 10-year risk than all individual risk factors apart from BMI and biomarkers of dysglycemia. The metaPRS modestly improved T2D risk stratification of QDiabetes risk scores for 10-year risk prediction, particularly when prioritising individuals for blood tests of dysglycemia.

Prior studies, performed with single-plane imaging, suggest that subpopulations of electrically coupled lower case Greek beta-cells have privileged roles in leading and coordinating the propagation of Ca2+ waves. Here, we used 3D light-sheet imaging to analyze the location and Ca2+ activity of single lower case Greek beta-cells within the entire islet at >2 Hz. Network analysis indicates that the most highly synchronized lower case Greek beta-cells are located at the islet center and remain geographically stable between oscillations. In contrast, lower case Greek beta-cells that initiate the Ca2+ wave ('leaders') are located at the islet periphery and change their identity over time via rotations in the wave axis. Activators of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase were used to further test the influence of glycolysis on these lower case Greek beta-cell subpopulations. Glucokinase activation, which increased oscillation period, reinforced leader cells and stabilized the wave axis. Pyruvate kinase activation, despite increasing oscillation frequency, had no effect on leader cells, indicating the wave origin is patterned by fuel input. The 3D islet lower case Greek beta-cell network, which did not respond to either treatment, is insensitive to changes in fuel metabolism. These findings emphasize the stochastic nature of Ca2+ oscillations and identify a role for glucokinase in spatially patterning 'leader' lower case Greek beta-cells.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

These discoveries reveal a novel mechanism wherein maternal IgG engages the offspring immune system to calibrate responses to gut microbes.

Materials and methodsA compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model was adapted to reflect COVID-19 cases in the UK. Numbers of symptomatic infections, COVID-19- related hospitalizations and deaths, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were predicted using a decision tree. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of an updated Moderna mRNA vaccine (Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign) was compared to no Autumn 2024 vaccine and to an updated Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA Autumn 2024 vaccine, from a healthcare perspective.

ResultsThe Moderna Autumn 2024 Vaccination Campaign is predicted to decrease the expected 8.3 million symptomatic infections with no vaccination by 19% to 6.7 million. Hospitalizations, long COVID cases, and deaths are expected to decline by 27,000 (-38%), 59,000 (-19%), and 6000 (-43%), respectively. The Moderna Autumn 2024 Campaign will increase QALYs by 78,000 and costs by {pound}665 million, yielding an ICER of {pound}8500/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses suggest that vaccine effectiveness (VE) and waning, symptomatic infection incidence, hospitalization rates, and mortality rates drive cost-effectiveness. Vaccination remains cost-effective when lowering the target population to [&ge;]50 years. Use of the Moderna vaccine is expected to prevent 8000 more hospitalizations and 1700 more deaths than the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

ConclusionsVaccination of the eligible population would contribute to significant reductions in hospitalizations, deaths, and long COVID in the UK in the 2024-2025 season. Expanding the target population continues to be cost-effective.

However, whether individual neurons also embed information about their own anatomical location within their spike patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that machine learning models can predict a neurons anatomical location across multiple brain regions and structures based solely on its spiking activity. Analyzing high-density recordings from thousands of neurons in awake, behaving mice, we demonstrate that anatomical location can be reliably decoded from neuronal activity across various stimulus conditions, including drifting gratings, naturalistic movies, and spontaneous activity. Crucially, anatomical signatures generalize across animals and even across different research laboratories, suggesting a fundamental principle of neural organization. Examination of trained classifiers reveals that anatomical information is enriched in specific interspike intervals as well as responses to stimuli. Within the visual isocortex, anatomical embedding is robust at the level of layers and primary versus secondary but does not robustly separate individual secondary structures. In contrast, structures within the hippocampus and thalamus are robustly separable based on their spike patterns. Our findings reveal a generalizable dimension of the neural code, where anatomical information is multiplexed with the encoding of external stimuli and internal states. This discovery provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and function, with broad implications for neurodevelopment, multimodal integration, and the interpretation of large-scale neuronal recordings. Immediately, it has potential as a strategy for in-vivo electrode localization.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Surprisingly, milkshake consumption did not result in significant postingestive dopamine response in the striatum (p=0.62) nor any striatal subregion (p>0.33) and the highly variable interindividual responses were not significantly related to adiposity (BMI: r=0.076, p=0.51; %body fat: r=0.16, p=0.28).

The delivery of conventional IgG antibody technologies targeting GD2 is limited clinically by its co-expression on nerves that contributes to toxicity presenting as severe neuropathic pain. To improve the tumor selectivity of current GD2-targeting approaches, a next-generation bispecific antibody targeting GD2 and B7-H3 (CD276) was generated.

MethodsDifferential expression of human B7-H3 (hB7-H3) was transduced into GD2+ B78 murine melanoma cells and confirmed by flow cytometry. We assessed the avidity and selectivity of our GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies (INV34-6, INV33-2, and INV36-6) towards GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 cells relative to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells using flow cytometry and competition binding assays, comparing results an anti-GD2 antibody (dinutuximab, DINU). The bispecific antibodies, DINU, and a non-targeted bispecific control (bsAb CTRL) were conjugated with deferoxamine for radiolabeling with Zr-89 (t1/2 = 78.4 h). Using positron emission tomography (PET) studies, we evaluated the in vivo avidity and selectivity of the GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific compared to bsAb CTRL and DINU using GD2+/hB7-H3+ and GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumor models.

ResultsFlow cytometry and competition binding assays showed that INV34-6 bound with high avidity to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells with high avidity but not GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 cells. In comparison, no selectivity between cell types was observed for DINU. PET in mice bearing the GD2+/hB7-H3- and GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 murine tumor showed similar biodistribution in normal tissues for [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6, [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL, and [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU. Importantly, [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 tumor uptake was selective to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 over GD2+/hB7-H3- B78 tumors, and substantially higher to GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 than the non-targeted [89Zr]Zr-Df-bsAb CTRL control. [89Zr]Zr-Df-DINU displayed similar uptake in both GD2+ tumor models, with uptake comparable to [89Zr]Zr-Df-INV34-6 in the GD2+/hB7-H3+ B78 model.

ConclusionThe GD2-B7-H3 targeting bispecific antibodies successfully improved selectivity to cells expressing both antigens. This approach should address the severe toxicities associated with GD2-targeting therapies by reducing off-tumor GD2 binding in nerves. Continued improvements in bispecific antibody technologies will continue to transform the therapeutic biologics landscape.

Although many effectors have been identified, their secretion mechanism often remains unknown. Here, we describe WHIX, a domain that is sufficient to mediate the secretion of effectors via the T6SS. Remarkably, we find WHIX in T6SS effectors that contain a single toxic domain, as well as in effectors that contain two distinct toxic domains fused to either side of WHIX. We demonstrate that the latter, which we name double-edged sword effectors, require two cognate immunity proteins to antagonize their toxicity. Furthermore, we show that WHIX can be used as a chassis for T6SS-mediated secretion of multiple domains. Our findings reveal a new class of polymorphic T6SS cargo effectors with a unique secretion domain that can deploy two toxic domains in one shot, possibly reducing recipients ability to defend themselves.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Whether growth conditions affect other stages of replication beyond initiation, remains to be systematically studied. To address this, we assess the replication dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus, a bacterium that undergoes only single round of replication per cell cycle, by tracking the replisome across various growth phases and nutrient conditions. We find that the replication elongation rates slowdown as cells transition from exponential (high-nutrient) to stationary (low-nutrient) phase, and this contributes significantly to the overall cell cycle delay. While elongation rates are correlated with growth rates, both properties appear to be differentially influenced by nutrient status. This slowdown in replication progression is not associated with increased mutagenesis or upregulation of the DNA damage responses. We conclude that the growth conditions not only dictate the commitment to replication but also the rates of genome duplication. Such regulation appears to be distinct from stress-induced replication slowdown and likely serves as an adaptive mechanism to cope with fluctuations in nutrient availability in the environment.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

This technology allows researchers to sequence longer DNA fragments in a single read, providing more comprehensive genomic information compared to previous methods. Nanopore sequencing operates on electrical signals generated by a nanopore embedded in a membrane separating two electrolyte-filled chambers. When single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) passes through the nanopore, it creates variations in the current that correspond to different DNA bases. By analyzing these current fluctuations with machine learning algorithms, the DNA sequence can be determined.

Key to this are activation domains, which often fall within disordered regions of transcription factors3,4 and recruit co-activators to initiate transcription5. These interactions are difficult to characterize via most experimental techniques because they are typically weak and transient6,7. Consequently, we know very little about whether these interactions are promiscuous or specific, the mechanisms of binding, and how these interactions tune the strength of gene activation. To address these questions, we developed a microfluidic platform for expression and purification of hundreds of activation domains in parallel followed by direct measurement of co-activator binding affinities (STAMMPPING, for Simultaneous Trapping of Affinity Measurements via a Microfluidic Protein-Protein INteraction Generator). By applying STAMMPPING to quantify direct interactions between eight co-activators and 204 human activation domains (>1,500 Kds), we provide the first quantitative map of these interactions and reveal 334 novel binding pairs. We find that the metazoan-specific co-activator P300 directly binds >100 activation domains, potentially explaining its widespread recruitment across the genome to influence transcriptional activation. Despite sharing similar molecular properties (e.g. enrichment of negative and hydrophobic residues), activation domains utilize distinct biophysical properties to recruit certain co-activator domains. Co-activator domain affinity and occupancy are well-predicted by analytical models that account for multivalency, and in vitro affinities quantitatively predict activation in cells with an ultrasensitive response. Not only do our results demonstrate the ability to measure affinities between even weak protein-protein interactions in high throughput, but they also provide a necessary resource of over 1,500 activation domain/co-activator affinities which lays the foundation for understanding the molecular basis of transcriptional activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

MethodsWe employed molecular assays, cell and egg culture, Sanger and next generation sequencing to isolate and characterize viruses from multiple farm specimens (cow nasal swab, milk specimens, fecal slurry, and a dead bird).

ResultsWe detected H5N1 HPAIV in 64% (9/14) of milk specimens, 2.6% (1/39) of cattle nasal swab specimens, and none of 17 cattle worker nasopharyngeal swab specimens. We cultured and characterized virus from eight H5N1-positive specimens. Sanger and next-generation sequencing revealed the viruses were closely related into other recent Texas epizootic H5N1 strains of clade 2.3.4.4b. Our isolates had multiple mutations associated with increased spillover potential. Surprisingly, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in a nasal swab from a sick cow. Additionally, 14.3% (2/14) of the farm workers who donated sera were recently symptomatic and had elevated neutralizing antibodies against a related H5N1 strain.

ConclusionsWhile our sampling was limited, these data offer additional insight into the large H5N1 HPAIV epizootic which thus far has impacted at least 96 cattle farms in twelve US states. Due to fears that research might damage dairy businesses, studies like this one have been few. We need to find ways to work with dairy farms in collecting more comprehensive epidemiological data that are necessary for the design of future interventions against H5N1 HPAIV on cattle farms.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177772

Here, we show that stabilizing selection on quantitative traits--even around the same optimal trait values in the two populations and when the populations are demographically identical--generates selection against the minor-parent ancestry in a population formed via unequal admixture of the two populations. We calculate the rate at which minor-parent ancestry is purged under this mechanism, both in the early generations after admixture and in the long term, and we verify these calculations with whole-genome simulations. Because of its ubiquity, stabilizing selection offers a general mechanism for the deleterious effect of introgressed ancestry.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Here, we use the UK Biobank to measure the change in PGS prediction accuracy as a continuous function of individuals genome-wide genetic dissimilarity to the GWAS sample (""genetic distance""). Our results highlight three gaps in our understanding of PGS portability. First, prediction accuracy is extremely noisy at the individual level and not well predicted by genetic distance. In fact, variance in prediction accuracy is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. Second, trends of portability vary across traits. For several immunity-related traits, prediction accuracy drops near zero quickly even at intermediate levels of genetic distance. This quick drop may reflect GWAS associations being more ancestry-specific in immunity-related traits than in other traits. Third, we show that even qualitative trends of portability can depend on the measure of prediction accuracy used. For instance, for white blood cell count, a measure of prediction accuracy at the individual level (reduction in mean squared error) increases with genetic distance. Together, our results show that portability cannot be understood through global ancestry groupings alone. There are other, understudied factors influencing portability, such as the specifics of the evolution of the trait and its genetic architecture, social context, and the construction of the polygenic score. Addressing these gaps can aid in the development and application of PGS and inform more equitable genomic research.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

We identified multiple novel epigenetic tumor suppressor and tumor dependency genes.

High-accuracy, long-read sequencing can substantially improve SV characterization when coupled with effective calling methods. While state-of the-art long-read SV callers are highly accurate, further improvements are achievable by systematically modeling local haplotypes during SV discovery and genotyping.

ResultsWe describe sawfish, an SV caller for mapped high-quality long reads incorporating systematic SV haplotype modeling to improve accuracy and resolution. Assessment against the draft Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) SV benchmark from the T2T-HG002-Q100 diploid assembly shows that sawfish has the highest accuracy among state-of-the-art long-read SV callers across every tested SV size group. Additionally, sawfish maintains the highest accuracy at every tested depth level from 10 to 32-fold coverage, such that other callers required at least 30-fold coverage to match sawfish accuracy at 15-fold coverage. Sawfish also shows the highest accuracy in the GIAB challenging medically relevant genes benchmark, demonstrating improvements in both comprehensive and medically relevant contexts.

When joint-genotyping 10 samples from CEPH-1463, sawfish has over 9000 more pedigree-concordant calls than other state-of-the-art SV callers, with the highest proportion of concordant SVs (78%) as well. Sawfishs quality model can be used to select for an even higher proportion of concordant SVs (86%), while still calling over 5000 more pedigree-concordant SVs than other callers. These results demonstrate that sawfish improves on the state-of-the-art for long-read SV calling accuracy across both individual and joint-sample analyses.

In particular, red-shifted opsins offer access deeper within the brain tissue. It is however crucial to consider the potential unintended back-activation of endogenous opsins due to laser light striking the back of the retina. Here, we found that in complete darkness and with no expression of exogenous opsins, optical fiber laser stimulation at wavelengths of 637 nm (red), 594 nm (orange), or 473 nm (blue) from within the ipsilateral mouse visual cortex resulted in a strong neuronal response in its contralateral counterpart. This neuronal activation occurred even at low laser intensities (1mW at the fiber tip, 31.8mW/mm2) and was most pronounced using red wavelengths. We therefore took advantage of retinal light adaptation using external illumination with a relatively dim ambient light source (20 lux) which was found to completely abolish orange and blue laser-evoked neuronal activation from within the brain, even at high laser intensities (15mW, 477.3mW/mm2). To prevent red laser-evoked retinal activation, however, only much lower intensities (2.5mW, 79.6mW/mm2) combined with external illumination (20 lux) could be used. These findings demonstrate the critical need for careful selection of light wavelengths and intensities for laser stimulation during optogenetic experiments in the mouse brain in vivo. Additionally, light adaptation of the retina through ambient light exposure offers an effective solution to minimize unintended retinal activation.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Anti-defense proteins have diverse functional domains, sequences, and are typically small, creating a challenge to detect anti-defense homologs across the prokaryotic genomes. To date, no tools comprehensively annotate anti-defense proteins within a desired genome or MGE. Here, we developed ""AntiDefenseFinder"" - a free open-source tool and web service that detects 156 anti-defense systems (of one or more proteins) in any genomic sequence. Using this dataset, we identified 47,981 anti-defense systems distributed across prokaryotes, phage, and MGEs. We found that some genes co-localize in ""anti-defense islands"", including E. coli T4 and Lambda phages, although many are standalone. Out of the 112 systems detected in bacteria, 100 systems localize only or preferentially in prophages, plasmids, phage satellites, integrons, and integrative and conjugative elements. However, over 80% of anti-Pycsar protein 1 (Apyc1) resides in non-mobile regions of bacteria. Evolutionary and functional analyses revealed that Apyc1 likely originated in bacteria to regulate cNMP signaling, but was co-opted multiple times by phages to overcome cNMP-utilizing defenses. With the AntiDefenseFinder tool, we hope to facilitate the identification of the full repertoire of anti-defense systems in MGEs, the discovery of new protein functions, and a deeper understanding of host-pathogen arms race.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

This slicing drives post-transcriptional gene-silencing pathways that are essential for many eukaryotes and the basis for new clinical therapies. Despite this importance, structural information on eukaryotic AGOs in a fully paired, slicing-competent conformation--hypothesized to be intrinsically unstable--has been lacking. Here we present the cryogenic-electron microscopy structure of a human AGO-guide complex bound to a fully paired target, revealing structural rearrangements that enable this conformation. Critically, the N domain of AGO rotates to allow the RNA full access to the central channel and forms contacts that license rapid slicing. Moreover, a conserved loop in the PIWI domain secures the RNA near the active site to enhance slicing rate and specificity. These results explain how AGO accommodates targets possessing the pairing specificity typically observed in biological and clinical slicing substrates.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Elevated AABs to proteins in the nervous system were found in LC patients with neurocognitive and neurological symptoms. Purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) samples from these individuals reacted with human pons tissue and were cross-reactive with mouse sciatic nerves, spinal cord, and meninges. Antibody reactivity to sciatic nerves and meninges correlated with patient-reported headache and disorientation. Passive transfer of IgG from patients to mice led to increased sensitivity and pain, mirroring patient-reported symptoms. Similarly, mice injected with IgG showed loss of balance and coordination, reflecting donor-reported dizziness.

In neuroscience, this fact has inspired several recent studies in sensory and motor systems. However, less is known about how higher associational cortical areas, such as the hippocampus, modify representations throughout the learning of complex tasks. Here we focus on associative learning, a process that requires forming a connection between the representations of different variables for appropriate behavioral response. We trained rats in a spatial-context associative task and monitored hippocampal neural activity throughout the entire learning period, over several days. This allowed us to assess changes in the representations of context, movement direction and position, as well as their relationship to behavior. We identified a hierarchical representational structure in the encoding of these three task variables that was preserved throughout learning. Nevertheless, we also observed changes at the lower levels of the hierarchy where context was encoded. These changes were local in neural activity space and restricted to physical positions where context identification was necessary for correct decision making, supporting better context decoding and contextual code compression. Our results demonstrate that the hippocampal code not only accommodates hierarchical relationships between different variables but also enables efficient learning through minimal changes in neural activity space. Beyond the hippocampus, our work reveals a representation learning mechanism that might be implemented in other biological and artificial networks performing similar tasks.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

The network provides multiple drug targets because of its role in metabolic disease and cancer, and these are candidates for repurposing for geroprotection. For instance, inhibition of the activity of the mTORC1 complex by rapamycin can extend lifespan in multiple organisms including mice, with early indications of efficacy in humans. Trametinib inhibits MEKs in the Ras pathway and can extend lifespan in Drosophila. However, it is not yet known if trametinib alone or in combination with rapamycin can extend mouse lifespan or improve health at older ages. We assessed survival and health indices of female and male mice treated with trametinib or rapamycin alone, or with the two in combination at the same doses. Trametinib treatment extended lifespan in both sexes, while its combination with rapamycin caused further, additive prolongation. Combination treatment reduced liver tumours in both sexes and spleen tumours in males, and ameliorated the age-related increase in brain glucose uptake. There was a striking reduction in inflammation in the brain, kidney, spleen and muscle with combination treatment, accompanied by reduced circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Trametinib alone is therefore geroprotective in mice, but combined trametinib and rapamycin treatment is more geroprotective than treatment with either drug alone, suggesting immediate translational potential for humans.","NA","biorxiv",1724710177772

Researchers have shown a strong interest in the perceived problem of vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers, yet not in their lived experience of the policy or in their views on the policys impact on the quality of patient care in the province.

GoalTo document the experience and views on mandated vaccination of healthcare workers in the province of Ontario, Canada.

MethodsBetween February and March 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of Ontario healthcare workers, recruited through professional contacts, social media, and word-of-mouth.

FindingsMost respondents, most with 16 or more years of professional experience, were unvaccinated, and most had been terminated due to non-compliance with mandates. As well, and regardless of vaccination status, most respondents reported safety concerns with vaccination, yet did not request an exemption due to their experience of high rejection rates by employers. Nevertheless, most unvaccinated workers reported satisfaction with their vaccination choices, although they also reported significant, negative impacts of the policy on their finances, their mental health, their social and personal relationships, and to a lesser degree, their physical health. In contrast, most respondents within the minority of vaccinated respondents reported being dissatisfied with their vaccination decisions, as well as having experienced mild to serious post vaccine adverse events, with about one-quarter within this group reporting having been coerced into taking further doses, under threat of termination, despite these events. Further, a large minority of respondents reported having witnessed underreporting or dismissal by hospital management of adverse events post vaccination among patients, worse treatment of unvaccinated patients, and concerning changes in practice protocols. Close to half also reported their intention to leave the healthcare industry.

DiscussionOur findings indicate that in Ontario, Canada, mandated vaccination in the health sector had an overall negative impact on the well-being of the healthcare labour force, on patient care, on the sustainability of the health system, and on ethical medical practice. Our study should be reproduced in other provinces, as well as in other countries that adopted comparable policies. Findings from this and similar studies should be seriously considered when planning for future health emergencies, to protect health systems in crisis due to severe labour shortages, as well as the right to informed consent of healthcare workers and members of the public.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177772

ObjectiveTo describe rates and factors associated with discontinuation and reinitiation of GLP-1 RA, for patients with and without T2D.

DesignIn this retrospective cohort study, adults with overweight or obesity initiated on GLP-1 RA between January 2018 and December 2023 were identified using electronic health record (EHR) data from a collective of 30 US healthcare systems. Patients were followed for up to 2 years to assess discontinuation and for 2 additional years to assess reinitiation.

SettingClinical and prescribing data from EHRs linked to dispensing information

ParticipantsAdults newly initiated on GLP-1 RA between 2018 and 2023, with a baseline BMI [&ge;]27 and an available weight measurement within 60 days before initiation, and regular care in the year before initiation.

Exposure/CovariatesPatients were stratified by presence of T2D at baseline. Associations with socio-demographics, health factors, weight changes, and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were modeled.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresProportion of patients discontinuing and reinitiating GLP-1 RA were estimated from Kaplan-Meier models. Associations between covariates and discontinuation and reinitiation outcomes were modeled using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.

Individual income exceeded $50,000 for 49.7% of patients with and 57.2% of patients without T2D. One-year discontinuation was significantly higher for patients without T2D (65.1%), compared to those with T2D (45.8%). Higher weight loss, absence of GI AE, and higher income (T2D only) were significantly associated with higher discontinuation. Of 28,142 who discontinued and had a discontinuation weight available, one-year reinitiation was lower for those without T2D (34.7%), compared to those with T2D (51.0%). Weight re-gain was significantly associated with increased reinitiation.

Conclusions and RelevanceMost patients with overweight or obesity discontinue GLP-1 RA within 1 year, but those without T2D discontinue at higher rates and reinitiate at lower rates.

Inequities in access and adherence to effective treatments have the potential exacerbate disparities in obesity.

Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow frequently do adults with overweight or obesity discontinue and subsequently reinitiate GLP-1 RA? What factors are associated with these outcomes?

FindingsIn this study of 96,544 patients initiating GLP-1 RA, 46% of patients with and 65% without type 2 diabetes (T2D) discontinued within 1 year. Weight loss, income, gastrointestinal adverse events, and comorbidities were significantly associated with discontinuation. Following discontinuation, 51% of patients with and 35% without T2D reinitiated within a year. Weight re-gain since discontinuation was significantly associated with reinitiation.

MeaningWhile most patients discontinue GLP-1 RA within a year, discontinuation is significantly higher and reinitiation is significantly lower for patients without T2D. Weight changes, tolerability, and proxies of access to care are significantly associated with sustained treatment.","NA","medrxiv",1724710177772
