This paper aimed to assess a multitude of cardiac signs, symptoms, and conditions, as well as focused on patients with and without congenital heart defects (CHDs), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the post-acute cardiovascular outcomes among children and adolescents after COVID-19.

MethodsThis retrospective cohort study used data from the RECOVER consortium comprising 19 US childrens hospitals and health institutions between March 2020 and September 2023. Every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry. Absolute risks of incident post-acute COVID-19 sequelae were reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by contrasting COVID-19-positive with COVID-19-negative groups using a Poisson regression model, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization factors through propensity scoring stratification.

ResultsA total of 1,213,322 individuals under 21 years old (mean[SD] age, 7.75[6.11] years; 623,806 male [51.4%]) were included. The absolute rate of any post-acute cardiovascular outcome in this study was 2.32% in COVID-19 positive and 1.38% in negative groups. Patients with CHD post-SARS-CoV-2 infection showed increased risks of any cardiovascular outcome (RR, 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.47-1.80), including increased risks of 11 of 18 post-acute sequelae in hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias), myocarditis, other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrest), thrombotic disorders (thrombophlebitis and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain and palpitations). Those without CHDs also experienced heightened cardiovascular risks after SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.57-1.69), covering 14 of 18 conditions in hypertension, arrhythmias (ventricular arrhythmias and premature atrial or ventricular contractions), inflammatory heart disease (pericarditis and myocarditis), other cardiac disorders (heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, and cardiogenic shock), thrombotic disorders (pulmonary embolism and thromboembolism), and cardiovascular-related symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, and syncope).

ConclusionsBoth children with and without CHDs showed increased risks for a variety of cardiovascular outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the need for targeted monitoring and management in the post-acute phase.

Clinical Perspective sectionO_ST_ABSWhat is new?C_ST_ABSO_LIWe investigated the risks of 18 post-acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes in the pediatric population without Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in over 1 million patients, stratified by congenital heart defects (CHD) status.
C_LIO_LIWe extended the follow-up period beyond previous pediatric studies, ensuring every participant had at least a six-month follow-up after cohort entry.
C_LIO_LIWe included a comprehensive cross-section of the US pediatric population across various healthcare settings including primary, specialty, and emergency care, as well as testing and inpatient facilities.
C_LI

What are the clinical implications?O_LIWithin the post-acute phase, children and adolescents previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at statistically significant increased risk of incident cardiovascular outcomes, including hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, myocarditis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrest, thromboembolism, chest pain, and palpitations. These findings are consistent among patients with and without CHDs.
C_LIO_LIAwareness of the heightened risk of cardiovascular disorders after COVID-19 can lead to a timely referral, investigations, and management of these conditions in children and adolescents.

In order to determine the N, the usual approach is to perform a power calculation, which involves understanding the variability between samples and the expected effect size. Here, we focused on bulk RNA-seq experiments, which have become ubiquitous in biology, but which have many unknown or difficult to estimate parameters, and so the required analyses to determine the minimum N is typically lacking. We therefore performed two N=30 profiling studies between wild-type mice and mice in which one copy of a gene had been deleted, to determine how many mice would be required to minimize false positives and to maximize true discoveries found in the N of 30 experiment. Results from experiments with N=4 or less are shown to be highly misleading, given the substantial false positive rate, and the lack of discovery of genes later found with higher N. For a cut-off of 2-fold expression differences, we found that an N of 6-7 mice was required to consistently decrease the false positive rate to below 50%, and that more is always better when it came to discovery rates - an N of 8-12 is significantly better in lowering the false positive rate. A common method to reduce false discovery rate in underpowered experiments is to raise the fold cutoff or increase the stringency of the P-value and include only highly perturbed, highly significant genes. A common method to reduce false discovery rate in underpowered experiments is to raise the fold cutoff or increase the stringency of the P-value and include only highly perturbed, highly significant genes. We show that this strategy is no substitute for increasing the N of the experiment, because it consistently inflated effect sizes and caused a substantial drop in sensitivity. These data should be helpful to others in choosing their Ns, since it's often not practical to do such large studies for every mouse model.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

During the pandemic, it became apparent that ancestry was associated with COVID-19 severity and morbidity, such that individuals of African descent tended to have worse outcomes than other populations. One factor that may influence COVID-19 outcomes is the circulating proteomic response to infection. This study examines how different ancestries had differential circulating protein levels in response to severe COVID-19 infection.

Methods4,979 circulating proteins from 1,272 samples were measured using the SomaScan platform. We used a linear mixed model to assess the ancestry-specific association between the level of each protein and severe COVID-19 illness, accounting for sex, age, and days since symptom onset. We then compared each ancestry-specific effect size of severe COVID-19 illness on protein level to one another in a pairwise manner to generate Z-scores. These Z-scores were then converted into p-values and corrected for multiple comparisons using a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate of 5%.

ResultsComparing ancestries, we found that 62% of the tested proteins are associated with severe COVID-19 in European-ancestry individuals, compared to controls. We found that 45% and 22% of the tested proteins were different between COVID-19 infected and control individuals in people of African and East Asian ancestry, respectively. There was a strong correlation in effect size between ancestries. We found that individuals of European and African ancestry had the most similar response with a Pearson correlation of 0.868, 95% CI [0.861, 0.875] while European and East Asian ancestries had a Pearson correlation of 0.645, 95% CI [0.628, 0.661] and, East Asian and African ancestries had a Pearson correlation of 0.709, 95% CI [0.695, 0.722]. However, we found 39 unique proteins that responded differently (FDR < 0.05) between the three ancestries.

ConclusionsExamining 4,979 protein levels in 1,272 samples, we identified that the majority of measured proteins had similar responses to infection across individuals of European, African and East Asian ancestry. However, there were 39 proteins that may have a differential response to infection, when stratified by ancestry. These proteins could be investigated to assess whether they explain the differences in observed severity of COVID-19 between ancestral populations.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

Here we integrated published human metagenomic data of SARS-CoV-2 and developed a novel algorithm named as RedeCoronaVS to systematically dissect SARS-CoV-2 shedding modes with single-cell data as reference. We identify that SARS-CoV-2 particles are the dominant mode of viral shedding in the very early infection phase ([&le;]24 hours after hospitalization). Within the first week after hospitalization, SARS-CoV-2 replicons within host cells dominate SARS-CoV-2 shedding together with viral particles. One week later, viral fragments become the dominant mode in patients with mild or moderate symptoms, but viral replicons still dominate in some patients with severe symptoms. In addition to epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 replicons in neutrophils, macrophages, and plasma cells also show important roles and are associate with sampling time and disease severity.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

A recent application of this technique was used in a high-profile analysis in JAMA Internal Medicine to estimate the effect of cefepime, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, on mortality in severe infection. There has been ongoing concern that piperacillin-tazobactam, another broad-spectrum antibiotic with greater anaerobic activity might be inferior to cefepime, however this has not been shown in randomized controlled trials. The authors used an international shortage of piperacillin-tazobactam as an instrument, as during this shortage period, cefepime was used as an alternative. The authors report a strong mortality effect (5% absolute increase) with piperacillin-tazobactam. In this paper, we closely examine this estimate and find it is likely conditional on inclusion of a control variable (metronidazole usage). Inclusion of this variable is highly likely to lead to collider bias, which we show via simulation. We then generate estimates unadjusted for metronidazole which are much closer to the null and may represent residual confounding or confounding by indication. We highlight the ongoing challenge of collider bias in empirical IV analyses and the potential for large biases to occur. We finally suggest the authors consider including these unadjusted estimates in their manuscript, as the large increase in mortality reported with piperacillin-tazobactam is unlikely to be true.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

However, our quantitive understanding of the rules governing this pre-cancerous evolution remains incomplete. Here we exploit a unique collection of serial blood samples collected annually up to 15 years prior to diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to provide a quantitative description of pre-cancerous evolutionary dynamics. Using deep duplex sequencing and evolutionary theory, we quantify the acquisition ages and fitness effects of the key driver events in AML development. The first driver mutations are typically acquired in the first few decades of life when the blood remains highly polyclonal. These early slow-growing clones subsequently acquire multiple further driver mutations which confer selective advantages up to 100-fold larger than the early drivers. These faster-growing clones harbouring multiple driver mutations can cause complete somatic sweeps of the blood decades before diagnosis, a feature strongly associated with future AML. Once established in the blood, the dynamics of driver mutations are highly predictable. Trajectories are shaped by strong clonal competition between lineages with limited evidence of other extrinsic factors playing a major role. Our data show that the clonal dynamics of blood are consistent with a set of remarkably simple evolutionary rules which strike a balance between chance and determinism.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

However, reproducibility has not been systematically assessed within the context of electrophysiological recordings during cognitive behaviors. To address this, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. Experimenters in ten laboratories repeatedly targeted Neuropixels probes to the same location (spanning secondary visual areas, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice making decisions; this generated a total of 121 experimental replicates, a unique dataset for evaluating reproducibility of electrophysiology experiments. Despite standardizing both behavioral and electrophysiological procedures, some experimental outcomes were highly variable. A closer analysis uncovered that variability in electrode targeting hindered reproducibility, as did the limited statistical power of some routinely used electrophysiological analyses, such as single-neuron tests of modulation by task parameters. Reproducibility was enhanced by histological and electrophysiological quality-control criteria. Our observations suggest that data from systems neuroscience is vulnerable to a lack of reproducibility, but that across-lab standardization, including metrics we propose, can serve to mitigate this.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

This problem often has multiple solutions that cannot be distinguished based on current maximum parsimony principles alone. Current algorithms use ad hoc criteria to select among these solutions, and decide, a priori, what patterns of metastatic spread are more likely, which is itself a key question posed by studies of metastasis seeking to use these tools. Here we introduce Metient, a freely available open-source tool which proposes multiple possible hypotheses of metastatic spread in a cohort of patients and rescores these hypotheses using independent data on genetic distance of metastasizing clones and organotropism. Metient adapts Gumbel-softmax gradient estimators, to quickly map out a Pareto front of migration histories that cover the range of histories that are parsimonious under some criteria. Given a cohort of patients, Metient can calibrate its parsimony criteria, thereby identifying shared patterns of metastatic dissemination in the cohort. Compared with the current state-of-the-art, Metient recovers more migration histories, is more accurate, and is more than 40x faster. Reanalyzing metastasis in 169 patients based on 490 tumors, Metient automatically identifies cancer type-specific trends of metastatic dissemination in melanoma, high-risk neuroblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Metient's reconstructions usually agree with semi-manual expert analysis, however, in 24 patients, Metient identifies more plausible migration histories than experts, and thus finds that polyclonal seeding of metastases is more common than previously reported.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Here, we show that interleukin-6-like cytokine signaling from the Drosophila gut to brain glial cells regulates sleep. Under healthy conditions, this pathway promotes wakefulness. However, elevated gut cytokine signaling in response to oxidative stress - triggered by immune and inflammatory responses in the intestine - induces sleep. The cytokines Unpaired 2 and -3 are upregulated by oxidative stress in enteroendocrine cells and activate JAK-STAT signaling in glial cells, including those of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This activity maintains elevated sleep during oxidative-stress-induced intestinal disturbances, suggesting that the JAK-STAT pathway in glia inhibits wake-promoting signaling to facilitate sleep-dependent restoration under these conditions. We find that the enteric peptide Allatostatin A (AstA) enhances wakefulness, and during intestinal oxidative stress, gut-derived Unpaired 2/3 inhibits AstA receptor expression in BBB glia, thereby sustaining an elevated sleep state during gut inflammation or illness. Taken together, our work identifies a gut-to-glial communication pathway that couples sleep with intestinal homeostasis and disease, enhancing sleep during intestinal sickness, and contributes to our understanding of how sleep disturbances arise from gastrointestinal disturbances.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Here we introduce SPARCLS, a method for 3D random-access scanning at up to 340 kHz point rate using a single 1D phase modulator. We show the potential of this method by imaging synaptic events with fluorescent glutamate sensors in mammalian organotypic slices as well as in zebrafish larvae.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Protracted withdrawal is characterized by negative affective behaviors such as heightened anxiety, irritability, dysphoria, and anhedonia, which pose a significant risk factor for relapse. While the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and mu-opioid recep-tors (MORs) are critical for opioid reinforcement, the specific contributions of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating protracted withdrawal-induced negative affect is not fully understood. In our study, we elucidate the role of VTA-MOR neurons in mediating negative affect and altered brain-wide neuronal activities following opioid exposure and withdrawal in male and female mice. Utilizing a chronic oral mor-phine administration model, we observe increased social deficit, anxiety-related, and despair-like behaviors during protracted with-drawal. VTA-MOR neurons show heightened neuronal FOS activation at the onset of withdrawal and connect to an array of brain regions that mediate reward and affective processes. Viral re-expression of MORs selectively within the VTA of MOR knockout mice demon-strates that the disrupted social interaction observed during protracted withdrawal is facilitated by this neural population, without affect-ing other protracted withdrawal behaviors. Lastly, VTA-MORs contribute to heightened neuronal FOS activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in response to an acute morphine challenge, suggesting their unique role in modulating ACC-specific neuronal activity. These findings identify VTA-MOR neurons as critical modulators of low sociability during protracted withdrawal and highlight their potential as a mechanistic target to alleviate negative affective behaviors associated with opioid withdrawal.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

The ADMIXTURE software is a widely used model-based approach to account for population stratification, however, it struggles with convergence issues and does not scale to modern human datasets or to the large number of variants in whole-genome sequencing data. Likelihood-free approaches optimize a least square objective and have gained popularity in recent years due to their scalability. However, this comes at the cost of accuracy in the ancestry estimates. We present a new model-based approach, fastmixture, which adopts aspects from likelihood-free approaches for parameter initialization, followed by a mini-batch expectation-maximization procedure to model the standard likelihood. We demonstrate in a simulation study that the model-based approaches of fastmixture and ADMIXTURE are significantly more accurate than recent and likelihood-free approaches.

These hotspots operate in tandem to optimize both receptor binding for effective infection and immune evasion efficiency, thereby maintaining overall viral fitness. The lack of molecular details on structure, dynamics and binding energetics of the latest FLiRT and FLuQE variants with the ACE2 receptor and antibodies provides a considerable challenge that is explored in this study. We combined AlphaFold2-based atomistic predictions of structures and conformational ensembles of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike complexes with the host receptor ACE2 for the most dominant Omicron variants JN.1, KP.1, KP.2 and KP.3 to examine the mechanisms underlying the role of convergent evolution hotspots in balancing ACE2 binding and antibody evasion. Using the ensemble-based mutational scanning of the spike protein residues and computations of binding affinities, we identified binding energy hotspots and characterized molecular basis underlying epistatic couplings between convergent mutational hotspots. The results suggested that the existence of epistatic interactions between convergent mutational sites at L455, F456, Q493 positions that enable to protect and restore ACE2 binding affinity while conferring beneficial immune escape. To examine immune escape mechanisms, we performed structure-based mutational profiling of the spike protein binding with several classes of antibodies that displayed impaired neutralization against BA.2.86, JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3. The results confirmed the experimental data that JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3 harboring the L455S and F456L mutations can significantly impair the neutralizing activity of class-1 monoclonal antibodies, while the epistatic effects mediated by F456L can facilitate the subsequent convergence of Q493E changes to rescue ACE2 binding. Structural and energetic analysis provided a rationale to the experimental results showing that BD55-5840 and BD55-5514 antibodies that bind to different binding epitopes can retain neutralizing efficacy against all examined variants BA.2.86, JN.1, KP.2 and KP.3. The results support the notion that evolution of Omicron variants may favor emergence of lineages with beneficial combinations of mutations involving mediators of epistatic couplings that control balance of high ACE2 affinity and immune evasion.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

The bacterial phage shock protein A (PspA) has recently been identified as a bacterial member of the ESCRT-III superfamily, and monomeric PspA homo-oligomerizes to form large rod-shaped assemblies. As observed for eukaryotic ESCRT-III, PspA forms different tubular assemblies with varying diameters. Using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), we determined a total of 61 PspA structures and observed in molecular detail how structural plasticity of PspA rods is mediated by conformational changes at three hinge regions in the monomer and by the fixed as well as changing molecular contacts between protomers. Moreover, we reduced and increased the structural plasticity of PspA rods by removing the loop connecting helices 3/4 and the addition of nucleotides, respectively. Based on our analysis of PspA-mediated membrane remodeling, we suggest that the observed mode of structural plasticity is a prerequisite for the biological function of ESCRT-III superfamily members.

DesignObservational study.

Setting204 countries and territories.

Data sourcesGlobal Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 and Our World in Data.

Main outcome measuresAll-cause and COVID-19-specific age-standardized years lived with disability (YLD) rates and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC).

ResultsGlobally, the burden of GBS significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, age-standardized YLD rates were 0.86 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 0.56 to 1.24) per 100,000 people in 2020, rising to 1.75 (95% UI: 1.12 to 2.54) per 100,000 people in 2021, reflecting an EAPC of 70.35% (95% UI: 38.73 to 109.06) from 2019 to 2021. Regionally, the highest age-standardized YLD rates in 2020 and 2021 were observed in the high-income Asia Pacific and central Latin America, respectively, while the lowest rates were found in East Asia for both years. Age-standardized YLD rates rose 3.7 times faster in countries with a low socio-demographic index (SDI) versus countries with a high SDI (103.21% per year (95% UI: 71.10 to 141.35%) vs 28.02% per year (11.46 to 47.03)). Males generally had higher YLD rates across all age groups, with the highest disparity in those aged 80 and above. During the first two years of the pandemic, the increase in YLD rates was more pronounced in females and younger populations aged 15-29 years. A statistically negative correlation was observed between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the GBS burden, with increases in full vaccination coverage per 100 people leading to decreases in all-cause YLD rates by 0.0070 and COVID-19-specific YLD rates by 0.0128 per 100,000 people.

ConclusionPredominantly driven by the surge of COVID-19 cases, the burden of GBS significantly increased during the first two years of the pandemic, especially in those countries with lower SDI levels. Greater increases in the GBS burden were observed in females and younger populations (15-29 years). Importantly, the benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks in controlling the post-COVID-19 GBS burden, although significant disparities in vaccination coverage existed between countries. These findings offer robust evidence facilitating public education and transparent communication on COVID-19 vaccination and highlight the urgency for targeted control measures to manage the burden of post-infection complications, such as GBS, during future COVID-19 waves or other potential pandemics.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICGuillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease, and respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are the major triggering factors.

From 1990 to 2019, the burden of GBS was relatively low, with negligible changes observed in most countries and territories.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination on the burden of GBS remains not fully understood.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the global age-standardized years lived with disability (YLD) related to GBS increased by 70.30% annually, and low socio-demographic index (SDI) regions experienced the most rapid GBS burden increment (103.21%).

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was the primary factor contributing to the increased burden of GBS during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Improving vaccination coverage was the most effective measure to reduce the post-COVID-19 burden of GBS, and each additional fully vaccinated person (per hundred people) decreased the COVID-19-specific age-standardized YLD of GBS by 0.0128 per 100,000 population.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

Effector and memory T cells were reduced in Mecrfl/fl; Cd4cre mice, and MECR was required for activated CD4+ T cells to efficiently proliferate, differentiate, and survive. Mecr-deficient T cells also had decreased mitochondrial respiration, reduced TCA intermediates, and accumulated intracellular iron, which contributed to cell death and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Importantly, Mecr-deficient T cells exhibited fitness disadvantages in inflammatory, tumor, and infection models. mtFAS and MECR thus play important roles in activated T cells and may provide targets to modulate immune functions in inflammatory diseases. The immunological state of MECR- and mtFAS-deficient patients may also be compromised.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Here we use simulation and analysis to show that relaxed selection is generally favorable for valley-crossing when adaptive pathways require more than a single deleterious step. We also demonstrate that spatial heterogeneity in selection pressures could, by relaxing selection, allow populations to cross valleys much more rapidly than expected.

There is emerging evidence that the chronic MSK pain and associated symptoms in PCS have similarities to Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). This study aimed to characterise PCS related new-onset chronic MSK pain and its overlap with Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). Methods: Patients with new-onset chronic MSK pain following COVID-19 infection were enrolled and the nature of pain and associated symptoms captured using the C19-YRS (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale). FMS assessment was conducted as part of standard clinical examination using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010 criteria. Diagnosis of FMS was made when they meet the standard criteria of (1) Widespread Pain Index (WPI) [&ge;] 7 and Symptoms Severity (SS) score [&ge;] 5, or WPI is 3-6 and SS score [&ge;] 9, (2) symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months, and (3) the patient does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the symptoms. Results: Eighteen patients, twelve of whom were female, with an average age of 49.6 (SD 11.8) years and a Body Mass Index of 31.7 (SD 8.6) were enrolled. The average duration of symptoms from COVID-19 infection to assessment was 27.9 (SD 6.97) months. The new-onset chronic pain was widespread, primarily manifesting as muscle pain. Thirteen (72.2%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for FMS, with an average WPI score of 8.8 and an average SS score of 8.2, indicating a high level of pain and significant adverse impact on their quality of life. Conclusion: The study found that 72.2% of the patients with new-onset chronic MSK pain following COVID-19 infection met the criteria for FMS. These findings support the hypothesis that FMS may develop as a long-term sequela of a viral infection, underscoring the need for further research into post-viral long-term conditions.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

However, despite extensive experimental work focused on this regulation, quantifying SF regulatory activity in a form that can be readily applied to new analyses remains a challenge. Here we present an interpretable regression model, KATMAP, which explicitly models splicing changes upon SF knockdown in terms of changes in SF binding across the transcriptome and the resulting loss of regulation. This allows us to learn an SFs positional activity and predict the factors regulatory impact on individual exons, yielding regulatory models consistent with prior literature and highly reproducible across knockdowns of the same SF in different cell types, even generalizing well to related species. We leverage this generalizability to distinguish direct targets from the indirect effects of knockdown, and identify the secondary SFs responsible for these widespread indirect effects. We further uncover evidence of cooperative regulation between RBFOX and QKI. The generality of our statistical framework means it could be extended to the study of RNA regulation and processing beyond splicing.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

It holds that a rigorous study of conscious experience requires a transition in the subject from the ""natural attitude"" (NA) to the ""phenomenological attitude"" (PA). NA describes our ordinary stance, in which our attention is directed at external objects and events. PA is a distinctive, reflective stance in which our attention is directed at our conscious experience itself. Despite its theoretical importance in philosophy and science of consciousness, the neural mechanisms underlying PA remain unknown. To clarify this point, we developed a novel behavioral task in which participants alternate between NA and PA in relation to their stimulus-evoked subjective experiences. Participants are presented with two sentences and requested to identify the one that best captures their experience. These sentences are designed to induce either NA or PA. We found that participants had lower error rates but slower reaction times in the PA condition compared to the NA condition, suggesting a difference beyond task difficulty. Using fMRI, we also found that multivoxel activation patterns in the premotor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, and cerebellum successfully classified the task conditions. Furthermore, the activation strength in these regions was lower in the PA condition, indicating that PA depends on neural processes that suppress action-related information. These findings provide the first evidence for the neural signature of PA, contributing to a better understanding of phenomenological method and its underlying neural mechanisms.

Significance statementPhenomenology is one of the most promising approaches to study conscious experience. A key step is a transition from the natural attitude (NA)--where our attention is directed at external objects and events--to the phenomenological attitude (PA)--where our attention is directed toward our conscious experience itself. However, the neural processes underlying PA remain unclear. This study aimed to clarify this point by analyzing fMRI signals measured during a cognitive task that forced participants to repeatedly alternate between NA and PA. We observed that multiple action-related brain regions exhibited different activation patterns between NA and PA. Our findings provide the first neuroscientific evidence that illuminates the core process of the phenomenological method.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

To understand the scope of its benefits in damage reduction and potential limitations, this study evaluated the effects of AB-free kava on a panel of health indicators in mice exposed to 2 - 4 weeks of daily tobacco smoke exposure. Our comprehensive assessments included global transcriptional profiling of the lung and liver tissues, analysis of lung inflammation, evaluation of lung function, exploration of tobacco nicotine withdrawal, and characterization of the causal PKA signaling pathway. As expected, Tobacco smoke exposure perturbed a wide range of biological processes and compromised multiple functions in mice. Remarkably, AB-free kava demonstrated the ability to globally mitigate tobacco smoke-induced deficits at the molecular and functional levels with promising safety profiles, offering a unique promise to mitigate tobacco smoke-related health damages. Further pre-clinical evaluation and clinical translation are warranted to fully harness the potential of AB-free kava in combating tobacco smoke-related harms.

To investigate the longer-term effects of hypergravity, we have developed and utilized a custom-built hypergravity cultivation system using a centrifuge equipped with lighting, enabling the continuous growth of seed plants under hypergravity conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of 10 g hypergravity on the biomass of the shoot system (stems and rosette leaves) and the root system of vascular plants for the first time, covering the entire cultivation period from germination to 40 days. Our results showed that the dry mass of the stem per unit length was significantly higher under 10 g compared to the 1 g control, indicating a typical gravity resistance response of the stem. Moreover, the total dry mass of the stems, rosette leaves, and roots was higher under 10 g hypergravity compared to the 1 g control, suggesting an increase in biomass at the individual plant level. We also observed that the leaf mass per area of the rosette leaf was higher under hypergravity compared to the 1 g control, indicating enhanced photosynthesis rates in Arabidopsis and resulting in increased biomass of individual plants. In terms of biomass allocation, both root-shoot ratio and root mass fraction were significantly higher under hypergravity conditions compared to the 1 g control. Furthermore, we measured the content of mineral elements (Ca, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, P, Zn) in the roots and rosette leaves using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Despite the increase in dry mass of the root system, we found no significant differences in the content of any of the ions analyzed between 10 g and 1 g conditions, indicating that mineral nutrient uptake homeostasis is maintained even under hypergravity conditions.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Nevertheless, microgravity has a significant impact on humans. Immune and red blood cells utilize hematic or lymphatic streams (bio-fluid) as their primary mode of transport, and these streams have been identified as a significant concern under microgravity. This study aims to quantitatively address the puzzle of how cells are influenced by gravity when they are suspended in bio-fluid. The Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) approach was used to model blood and the cell by applying gravity as an external force along the vertical axis and varied from 0g to 2g during parameter sweeps. It was observed that the cell undergoes shape change and spatially aligns under the influence of gravity, and this was quantified with metrics such as Elongation and Deformation indices, pitch angle, and normalized center of mass. The Elongation Index and the normalized center of mass declined linearly with the applied gravity. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between applied gravity and the aforementioned variables. Forces exerted on the solid, specifically drag, shear stress, and solid forces, declined in magnitude as the gravitational force exerted on the cell was increased. Further analysis showed that increasing gravity affected the cells velocity, leading to extended proximity near the wall and increased viscous interaction with the surrounding fluid particles, triggering a shape change. This study marks a significant step in understanding gravitys effects on blood cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Clade I MPXV is prevalent in Central Africa and characterized by severe disease and high mortality, while Clade II is confined to West Africa and associated with milder illness. A Clade IIb MPXV emerged in Nigeria in 2017, with protracted human-to-human transmission a forerunner of the global Clade II B.1 lineage outbreak in 2022. In October 2023, a large mpox outbreak emerged in the Kamituga mining region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), of which we conducted an outbreak investigation.

MethodsSurveillance data and hospital records were collected between October 2023 and January 2024. Blood samples and skin/oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for molecular diagnosis at the National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa. MPXV genomes were sequenced and analyzed using Illumina NextSeq 2000 and bioinformatic tools.

ResultsThe Kamituga mpox outbreak spread rapidly, with 241 suspected cases reported within 5 months of the first reported case. Of 108 confirmed cases, 29% were sex workers, highlighting sexual contact as a key mode of infection. Genomic analysis revealed a distinct MPXV Clade Ib lineage, divergent from previously sequenced Clade I strains in DRC. Predominance of APOBEC3-type mutations and estimated time of emergence around mid-September 2023 suggest recent human-to-human transmission.

ConclusionsUrgent measures, including reinforced, expanded surveillance, contact tracing, case management support, and targeted vaccination are needed to contain this new pandemic-potential Clade Ib outbreak.","10.1038/s41591-024-03130-3","medrxiv",1720822033479

We analyzed the heroin and cocaine taking- and seeking-patterns and estimated drug-brain levels in the presence or absence of timeout between drug injections. We further assessed the effect of timeout and drug or social peer access time on drug preference. Removing the timeout had a profound effect on pattern of heroin taking and seeking, promoting the emergence of burst-like drug intake. Timeout removal had a modest effect on cocaine taking and seeking. Drug or social peer access time increased heroin but not cocaine preference. Removal of timeout during self-administration and increasing the access time during choice resulted in a self-administration procedure that more closely mimic human heroin intake, offering a platform to identify novel medications.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Studying diffusion-based structural connectivity in combination with cytoarchitecture, we found the DMN contains regions receptive to input from sensory cortex and a core that is relatively insulated from environmental input. Finally, analysis of signal flow with effective connectivity models showed that the DMN is unique amongst cortical networks in balancing its output across the levels of sensory hierarchies.

For transfer plasmids used in making AAV vectors, which are widely used in gene therapy, about 40% carried mutations in ITR regions due to their inherent instability, which is influenced by flanking GC content. We also list genes difficult to clone into plasmid or package into virus due to their toxicity.

Here, we report that the ChP base region harbors unique fibroblasts that cluster together, are connected by tight junctions and seal the ChP stroma from brain and CSF, thereby forming ChP base barrier cells (ChP BBCs). ChP BBCs are derived from meningeal mesenchymal precursors, arrive early during embryonic development, are maintained throughout life and are conserved across species. Moreover, we provide transcriptional profiles and key markers to label ChP BBCs and observe a striking transcriptional similarity with meningeal arachnoid barrier cells (ABCs).

Recombination is initiated with a double-strand break which is resolved via a crossover, which involves the reciprocal exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, or a non-crossover, which results in small tracts of non-reciprocal exchange of genetic material. Crossover and non-crossover rates vary between species, populations, individuals, and across the genome. In recent years, recombination rate has been associated with the distribution of ancestry derived from past interspecific hybridization (introgression) in a variety of species. We explore this interaction of recombination and introgression by sequencing spores and detecting crossovers and non-crossovers from two crosses of the yeast Saccharomyces uvarum. One cross is between strains which each contain introgression from their sister species, S. eubayanus, while the other cross has no introgression present. We find that the recombination landscape is significantly different between S. uvarum crosses, and that some of these differences can be explained by the presence of introgression in one cross. Crossovers are reduced and non-crossovers are increased in heterozygous introgression compared to syntenic regions in the cross without introgression. This translates to reduced allele shuffling within introgressed regions, and an overall reduction of shuffling on most chromosomes with introgression compared to the syntenic regions and chromosomes without introgression. Our results suggest that hybridization can significantly influence the recombination landscape, and that the reduction in allele shuffling contributes to the initial purging of introgression in the generations following a hybridization event.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Vipp1 has recently been identified as a member of the ESCRT-III superfamily of membrane remodeling proteins, albeit it still is elusive how Vipp1 interacts with and finally remodels membranes. Here we present a series of cryo-EM structures of cyanobacterial Vipp1 interacting with bacterial membranes: first, we solved seven structures between 5 and 7 [A] resolution of three unique helical and four types of stacked-ring assemblies engulfing membranes, and, second, using sub-tomogram averaging, we determined three [~]20 [A] resolution structures compatible with previously observed carpet structures at three different membrane curvatures. By analyzing ten additional unique structures of N-terminally truncated Vipp1, we could show that helix 0 is essential for membrane tubulation and forms the membrane anchoring domain of Vipp1. Using a conformation-restrained Vipp1 mutant, we were able to reduce the structural plasticity of Vipp1 assemblies in the presence of lipids and determined two structures of Vipp1 at 3.0 [A] resolution, resolving the molecular details of membrane anchoring and intersubunit contacts of helix 0. Our data reveal the molecular details of how Vipp1 interacts with membranes, showing membrane curvature-dependent structural transitions from carpets to rings and rods, some of which are capable of inducing and/or stabilizing high local membrane curvature triggering membrane fusion.

MDCs are triggered by perturbations in mitochondrial lipid and protein content, as well as increases in intracellular amino acids. Here, we sought to understand how amino acids trigger MDCs. We show that amino acid-activation of MDCs is dependent on the functional state of mitochondria. While amino acid excess triggers MDC formation when cells are grown on fermentable carbon sources, stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis blocks MDC formation. Moreover, amino acid elevation depletes TCA cycle metabolites in yeast, and preventing consumption of TCA cycle intermediates for amino acid catabolism suppresses MDC formation. Finally, we show that directly impairing the TCA cycle is sufficient to trigger MDC formation in the absence of amino acid stress. These results demonstrate that amino acids stimulate MDC formation by perturbing mitochondrial metabolism.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

The PARs share a unique activation mechanism driven by proteinase cleavage at a specific site within the extracellular amino-terminus, exposing a  tethered ligand that self-activates the receptor. Subsequent activation allows PAR family members to initiate complex intracellular signaling networks via traditional G protein-mediated pathways and beta-arrestin signaling and, in this way, the PARs link extracellular protease signaling molecules to cellular functions. Despite a primary reliance on biochemical studies for understanding tethered ligand recognition, direct structural visualization of these ligand-receptor complexes has been elusive. Here, we present structural snapshots of activated PAR1 and PAR2 bound to their endogenous tethered ligands, revealing, for the first time, shallow and constricted orthosteric binding pockets and highlighting critical residues involved in ligand recognition and receptor activation. Surprisingly, comparisons with antagonist-bound structures show minimal conformational changes in the TM6 helix, a typical signature of GPCR activation, with large movements of TM7 observed upon activation. These insights lead to the identification of a common mechanism for PAR1 and PAR2 activation and provide a structural template for designing novel antagonists targeting the orthosteric binding site, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

This study tested whether canonical additive and multiplicative neural computations, well-described in sensory systems, generalize to the corticospinal pathway during human action preparation. We used non-invasive brain stimulation to measure corticospinal input-output across varying action preparation contexts during instructed-delay finger response tasks. Goal-directed action preparation was marked by increased multiplicative gain of corticospinal projections to task-relevant muscles and additive suppression of corticospinal projections to non-selected and task-irrelevant muscles. Individuals who modulated corticospinal gain to a greater extent were faster to initiate prepared responses. Our findings provide physiological evidence of combined additive suppression and gain modulation in the human motor system. We propose these computations support action preparation by enhancing the contrast between selected motor representations and surrounding background activity to facilitate response selection and execution.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

We quantified these flows using their fundamental kinematic units: one attractor and two repellers constituting its Dynamic Morphoskeleton (DM). We have also elucidated the mechanistic origin of the attractor, marking the primitive streak (PS), and controlled its shape, inducing gastrulation flows in the chick embryo that are typical of other vertebrates. However, the origins of repellers and dynamic embryo shape remain unclear. Here, we address these questions using active matter physics and experiments. Repeller 1, separating the embryo proper (EP) from extraembryonic (EE) tissues, arises from the tug-of-war between EE epiboly and EP isotropic myosin-induced active stress. Repeller 2, bisecting the anterior and posterior PS and associated with embryo shape change, arises from anisotropic myosin-induced active intercalation in the mesendoderm. Combining mechanical confinement with inhibition of mesendoderm induction, we eliminated either one or both repellers, as predicted by our model. Our results reveal a remarkable modularity of avian gastrulation flows delineated by the DM, uncovering the mechanistic roles of EE epiboly, EP active constriction, mesendoderm intercalation and ingression. These findings offer a new perspective for deconstructing morphogenetic flows, uncovering their modular origin, and aiding synthetic morphogenesis.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

MethodsA total of 7361 asymptomatic community-dwelling people enrolled in the Test Us at Home parent study between October 2021 and February 2022. Participants self-collected anterior nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing every 24-48 hours for 10-14 days, regardless of symptom or infection status. Participants who had no history of COVID-19 at enrollment and who were subsequently found to have [&ge;]1 positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test during the parent study were recontacted in August 2023 and asked whether they had experienced long COVID, defined as the development of new symptoms lasting 3 months or longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants cycle threshold values were converted into viral loads, and slopes of viral clearance were modeled using post-nadir viral loads. Using a log binomial model with the modeled slopes as the exposure, we calculated the relative risk of subsequently developing long COVID with 1-2 symptoms, 3-4 symptoms, or 5+ symptoms, adjusting for age, number of symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. Adjusted relative risk (aRR) of individual long COVID symptoms based on viral clearance was also calculated.

Results172 participants were eligible for analyses, and 59 (34.3%) reported experiencing long COVID. The risk of long COVID with 3-4 symptoms and 5+ symptoms increased by 2.44 times (aRR: 2.44; 95% CI: 0.88-6.82) and 4.97 times (aRR: 4.97; 95% CI: 1.90-13.0) per viral load slope-unit increase, respectively. Participants who developed long COVID had significantly longer times from peak viral load to viral clearance during acute disease than those who never developed long COVID (8.65 [95% CI: 8.28-9.01] vs. 10.0 [95% CI: 9.25-10.8]). The slope of viral clearance was significantly positively associated with long COVID symptoms of fatigue (aRR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.22-6.69), brain fog (aRR: 4.94; 95% CI: 2.21-11.0), shortness of breath (aRR: 5.05; 95% CI: 1.24-20.6), and gastrointestinal symptoms (aRR: 5.46; 95% CI: 1.54-19.3).

DiscussionWe observed that longer time from peak viral load to viral RNA clearance during acute COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of developing long COVID. Further, slower clearance rates were associated with greater number of symptoms of long COVID. These findings suggest that early viral-host dynamics are mechanistically important in the subsequent development of long COVID.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

Understanding the immunogenicity of Omicron NTD and the properties of antibodies elicited by it is crucial for comprehending the impact of NTD mutations on viral fitness and guiding vaccine design. In this study, we find that most of NTD-targeting antibodies isolated from individuals with BA.5/BF.7 breakthrough infection (BTI) are ancestral (wildtype or WT)-reactive and non-neutralizing. Surprisingly, we identified five ultra-potent neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that can only bind to Omicron but not WT NTD. Structural analysis revealed that they bind to a unique epitope on the N1/N2 loop of NTD and interact with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) via the light chain. These Omicron-specific NAbs achieve neutralization through ACE2 competition and blockage of ACE2-mediated S1 shedding. However, BA.2.86 and BA.2.87.1, which carry insertions or deletions on the N1/N2 loop, can evade these antibodies. Together, we provided a detailed map of the NTD-targeting antibody repertoire in the post-Omicron era, demonstrating their vulnerability to NTD mutations enabled by its evolutionary flexibility, despite their potent neutralization. These results highlighted the importance of considering the immunogenicity of NTD in vaccine design.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

We characterized six new viral members belonging to distinct families, with evolutionary cues of beny-like viruses (Benyviridae), bunya-like viruses (Bunyaviridae) iflaviruses (Iflaviridae), orthomyxo-like viruses (Orthomyxoviridae), and rhabdoviruses (Rhabdoviridae). Phylogenetic analysis of the iflaviruses places them within the genus Iflavirus in affinity with other leafhoppers-associated iflaviruses. The five-segmented and highly divergent orthomyxo-like virus showed a relationship with other insect associated orthomyxo-like viruses. The rhabdo virus is related with a leafhopper associated rhabdo-like virus.

Identifying features associated with aging is essential for designing robust intervention strategies and discovering novel biomarkers of aging. Extensive studies at both the molecular and organ/whole-body physiological scales have helped determined features associated with aging. However, the lack of meso-scale studies, particularly at the tissue level, limits the ability to translate findings made at molecular scale to impaired tissue functions associated with aging. In this work, we established a tissue image analysis workflow - quantitative micro-anatomical phenotyping (qMAP) - that leverages deep learning and machine vision to fully label tissue and cellular compartments in tissue sections. The fully mapped tissue images address the challenges of finding an interpretable feature set to quantitatively profile age-related microanatomic changes. We optimized qMAP for skin tissues and applied it to a cohort of 99 donors aged 14 to 92. We extracted 914 microanatomic features and found that a broad spectrum of these features, represented by 10 cores processes, are strongly associated with aging. Our analysis shows that microanatomical features of the skin can predict aging with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.7 years, comparable to state-of-the-art epigenetic clocks. Our study demonstrates that tissue-level architectural changes are strongly associated with aging and represent a novel category of aging biomarkers that complement molecular markers.

The neural computation underlying flexible cognition and behavior relies on dynamic control of these structures. For example different tasks or behaviors are represented on different subspaces, requiring fast timescale subspace rotation to move from one behavior to the next. For flexibility in a particular behavior, the neural trajectory must be dynamically controllable within that behaviorally determined subspace. To understand how dynamic control of neural trajectories and their underlying subspaces may be implemented in neural circuits, we first characterized the relationship between features of neural activity sequences and aspects of the low dimensional projection. Based on this, we propose neural mechanisms that can act within local circuits to modulate activity sequences thereby controlling neural trajectories in low dimensional subspaces. In particular, we show that gain modulation and transient synaptic currents control the speed and path of neural trajectories and clustered inhibition determines manifold orientation. Together, these neural mechanisms may enable a substrate for fast timescale computation on neural manifolds.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

While the aetiology of Parkinsons disease remains elusive, the degeneration of the dopamine - producing nigrostriatal neurons, along with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, are pathophysiological hallmarks. The impairment of motor functions, a consequence of the involvement of the thalamic-frontal loop, dominates the overt clinical picture. However, more recent findings clarified that the symptoms are more widespread, and cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunctions are also common. Accordingly, neuroimaging studies show that, even in early disease, structural and functional alterations are not confined to the motor areas. This suggests that the effects of the nigro-striatal neurodegeneration are not restricted to the motor areas alone but, rather, they modify the behavior of the brain on a large scale. Understanding how the local degeneration of dopaminergic neurons affects the whole brain dynamics remains an open question.

The purpose of this study is to understand how the ability of the nigrostriatal pathways to support a dopaminergic stimulation affects the brain as a whole. To this end, we leverage simultaneous recordings from EEG and deep electrodes placed near the subthalamic nuclei (STN) from 10 Parkinsonian patients, acquired both before and after administration of L-Dopa. We used the topography of the spreading of aperiodic waves over a large scale (i.e. neuronal avalanches), utilizing the recently described avalanche transition matrix (ATM), to characterize the brain dynamics. To simulate the effect of L-Dopa in silico, we deployed a mechanistic neural-mass model derived from the adaptive quadratic integrate-and-fire model (aQIF) of individual neurons that has been extended to include dopamine concentration as a variable. Each parcelled brain region is equipped with a neural mass and then coupled according to the empirical connectomes, where connections can be either excitatory, inhibitory, or dopaminergic. Then, the whole-brain dynamics have been simulated for different configurations, i.e., for different dopaminergic tones. This way, we obtained a numerical prediction of the expected dynamics (in terms of properties of the ATMs), as observed in the deep electrodes and the EEG, given different dopaminergic tones. Then, in a Bayesian set-up, we used a class of deep neural networks to ""invert"" the model and infer the most likely dopaminergic tone given the empirically observed dynamics. For all ten patients, we correctly inferred that the dopaminergic tone was higher given the dynamics observed after administration of L-Dopa, and lower before. In other words, we could distinguish and quantify the dopaminergic tone from the electrophysiological data if the subjects had orally taken L-Dopa. This was achieved by integrating the background (anatomical and dynamical) knowledge into model prediction about the physiology of dopamine (as opposed to training a classifier to distinguish empirical data). Finally, we carried out a diagnostic for the validation of the model, as well as a further description of the simulated dopamine dynamics.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

The introduction of knowledge enhancement has improved the identification of important genes in cells by scKEPLM, and greatly enriched the understanding of cell function and disease mechanism.

Informed by invasive tract-tracing measurements, the cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in connectivity profiles to reveal the heterogeneity across cortical areas. However, it remains unclear about the organizing principles possibly shared by genetics and cortical wiring to manifest the spatial heterogeneity across the cortex. Instead of considering a complex one-to-one mapping between genetic coding and interareal connectivity, we hypothesized the existence of a more efficient way that the organizing principles are embedded in genetic profiles to underpin the cortical wiring space. Leveraging on the vertex-wise tractography in diffusion-weighted MRI, we derived the global connectopies to reliably index the organizing principles of interareal connectivity variation in a low-dimensional space, which specifically captured three dominant topographic patterns along the dorsoventral, rostrocaudal, and mediolateral axes of the cortex. More importantly, we demonstrated that the global connectopies converge to the gradients of vertex-by-vertex genetic correlation matrix on the phenotype of cortical morphology and the cortex-wide spatiomolecular gradients.

Taken together, our findings demonstrated the existence of a genetically determined space to encode the interareal connectivity variation, which may give new insights into the links between cortical connections and arealization.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

However, our understanding of how the pre-cancer microenvironment contributes to early tumorigenesis remains limited. Here, we show that newly emerging tumours at their most incipient stages shape their microenvironment in a critical process that determines their survival. Analysis of nascent squamous tumours in the upper gastrointestinal tract of the mouse reveals that the stress response of early tumour cells instructs the underlying mesenchyme to form a supportive ""pre-cancer niche"", which dictates the long-term outcome of epithelial lesions. Stimulated fibroblasts beneath emerging tumours activate a wound healing response that triggers a dramatic remodelling of the underlying extracellular matrix, resulting in the formation of a fibronectin-rich stromal scaffold that promotes tumour growth. Functional heterotypic 3D culture assays and in vivo grafting experiments, combining carcinogen-free healthy epithelium and tumour-derived stroma, demonstrate that the pre-cancerous niche alone is sufficient to confer tumour properties to healthy epithelial cells. We propose a model where both mutations and the stromal response to genetic stress defines the likelihood of early tumours to survive and progress towards more advanced disease stages.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

In mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), neuronal precursor cells (NPCs) as well as immortalized 3T3 cells, we find a strong and distinct H3.1 enrichment at chromocenters, with some variation in ESCs. Mechanistically, this H3.1 selective enrichment depends on the DNA Synthesis Coupled (DSC) deposition pathway operating in S phase. Yet, this selective enrichment is challenged when we target H3.3 deposition through the DNA Synthesis Independent (DSI) deposition pathway mediated by HIRA. Altering the H3.1/H3.3 equilibrium at chromocenters in ESCs affects its heterochromatin properties leading to mitotic defects. We thus reveal opposing mechanisms for H3.1 and H3.3 deposition with different enforcement according to cell cycle and potency which determine their ratio at chromocenters and are critical for genome stability and cell survival.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Here, we discover an orphan antitoxin counter-defense element in T4-like phages that can overcome the bacterial toxin-antitoxin phage defense system, DarTG1. The DarT1 toxin, an ADP-ribosyltransferase, modifies phage DNA to prevent replication while its cognate antitoxin, DarG1, is an ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase that reverses these modifications in uninfected bacteria. The orphan phage DarG1-like protein, which we term anti-DarT factor NADAR (AdfN), removes ADP-ribose modifications from phage DNA during infection thereby enabling replication in DarTG1-containing bacteria. AdfN, like DarG1, is in the NADAR superfamily of ADP-ribosylglycohydrolases found across domains of life. We find divergent NADAR proteins in unrelated phages that likewise exhibit anti-DarTG1 activity, underscoring the importance of ADP-ribosylation in bacterial-phage interactions, and revealing the function of a substantial subset of the NADAR superfamily.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Using a spatial memory task in rats, we simultaneously recorded ensembles from hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex to address this question. We found that task behaviors best aligned with low-dimensional, shared subspaces between these regions, rather than local activity in either region. Critically, both network oscillations and speed modulated the structure and performance of this communication subspace. Contrary to expectations, theta coherence did not better predict CA1-PFC shared activity, while theta power played a more significant role. To understand the communication space, we visualized shared CA1-PFC communication geometry using manifold techniques and found ring-like structures. We hypothesize that these shared activity manifolds are utilized to mediate the task behavior. These findings suggest that memory-guided behaviors are driven by shared CA1-PFC interactions that are dynamically modulated by oscillatory states, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between rhythms and behaviorally relevant neural communication.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Although human crossovers have been studied at the pedigree, population and single-cell level, the more frequent non-crossover events that lead to gene conversion are harder to study, particularly at the individual level. Here we show that single high-fidelity long sequencing reads from sperm can capture both crossovers and non-crossovers, allowing effectively arbitrary sample sizes for analysis from one male. Using fifteen sperm samples from thirteen donors we demonstrate variation between and within donors for the rates of different types of recombination. Intriguingly, we observe a tendency for non-crossover gene conversions to occur upstream of nearby PRDM9 binding sites, whereas crossover locations have a slight downstream bias. We further provide evidence for two distinct non-crossover processes. One gives rise to the vast majority of non-crossovers with mean conversion tract length under 50bp, which we suggest is an outcome of standard PRDM9-induced meiotic recombination. In contrast [~]2% of non-crossovers have much longer mean tract length, and potentially originate from the same process as complex events with more than two haplotype switches, which is not associated with PRDM9 binding sites and is also seen in somatic cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

In plants, the transport of cellular organelles to pathogen penetration sites and their assembly around the host membrane delineating plant-pathogen interface are well-documented. However, whether organelles associate with these specialized plant-pathogen membrane interfaces and the extent to which this process contributes to immunity remain unknown. Here, we discovered defense-related membrane contact sites (MCS) comprising a membrane tethering complex between chloroplasts and the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM) surrounding the pathogen haustorium. The assembly of this membrane tethering complex relies on the association between the chloroplast outer envelope protein CHLOROPLAST UNUSUAL POSITIONING 1 (CHUP1), and its plasma membrane-associated partner, KINESIN-LIKE PROTEIN FOR ACTIN-BASED CHLOROPLAST MOVEMENT 1 (KAC1). Our biochemical assays revealed that CHUP1 and KAC1 interact, while infection cell biology demonstrated their co-accumulation in foci where chloroplasts contact the EHM. Genetic depletion of CHUP1 or KAC1 reduces the deposition of callose--a cell wall material typically deployed to fortify pathogen penetration resistance--around the haustorium, without affecting other core immune processes. Our findings suggest that the chloroplast-EHM attachment complex positively regulates plant focal immunity, revealing the key components and their potential roles in the targeted deposition of defense components at the pathogen interface. These results advance our understanding of organelle-mediated immune responses and highlight the significance of MCS in plant-pathogen interactions.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Therefore, there is growing interst in further elucidating the mechanisms with which C-type lectins control tumor growth. Here, we report a key role of the CLEC18 family of C-type lectins in the progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The CLEC18 family is conserved across the entire Chordata phylum with recent gene duplication events in humans. We found that CLEC18A is exclusively expressed in the proximal tubule of the kidney and the medial habenula of the brain. We further identified sulfonated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of proteoglycans as the main CLEC18A ligand, making them unique among C-type lectins. In ccRCC patients, high expression of the CLEC18 family lectins in the tumor are associated with improved survival. In mouse models of ccRCC, deletion of the mouse ortholog Clec18a resulted in enhanced tumor growth. Our results establishes CLEC18A as a novel and critical regulators of ccRCC tumor growth and highlights the potential benefit of modulating CLEC18 expression in the renal tumor microenvironment.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Adaptor protein complexes (APs), which are recruited to membranes by the small GTPase ARF1, facilitate cargo selection and incorporation into trafficking intermediates. According to the classical model, small vesicles would facilitate bi-directional long-range transport between the Golgi, endosomes and plasma membrane. Here we revisit the intracellular organization of the vesicular transport machinery using a combination of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, live-cell high temporal (fast-confocal) or spatial (stimulated emission depletion (STED)) microscopy as well as correlative light and electron microscopy. We characterize novel tubulo-vesicular ARF1 compartments that harbor clathrin and different APs. Our findings reveal two functionally different classes of ARF1 compartments, each decorated by a different combination of APs. Perinuclear ARF1 compartments facilitate Golgi export of secretory cargo, while peripheral ARF1 compartments are involved in endocytic recycling downstream of early endosomes. Contrary to the classical model of long-range vesicle shuttling, we observe that ARF1 compartments shed ARF1 and mature into recycling endosomes. This maturation process is impaired in the absence of AP-1 and results in trafficking defects. Collectively, these data highlight a crucial role for ARF1 compartments in post-Golgi sorting.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Cell-specific circulating EV subsets show a wide range of concentrations, which do not directly reflect concentrations of blood cells, indicating diverse patterns of EV subset release and/or uptake, even for EVs originating from the same cell type. Interestingly, tetraspanin+ circulating EVs largely originate from platelets and to a lesser extent from lymphocytes. PCA and association analyses demonstrate high biological inter-individual variability in circulating EVs across healthy humans, which can be only partly explained by the influence of sex, menopausal status, age and smoking on specific circulating EV and/or tetraspanin+ circulating EV subsets. No global influence of the explored subjects factors on circulating EVs was detected. Our findings provide the first comprehensive, quantitative data towards the cell-origin atlas of blood EVs, with important implications in the clinical use of EVs as biomarkers of disease.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

The application of multiple GC factors selects for particular prokaryotic and viral communities different from the effects of any individual factor, favoring, for instance, potentially pathogenic unknown mycobacteria and novel viruses. At the functional level, multiple GC factors select for sessile and non-biofilm-forming bacteria which are metabolically diverse and show a high load of antibiotic resistance genes.

We have recently shown associations for CHIP with acute kidney injury and with kidney function decline in the general population, with stronger associations for CHIP driven by mutations in genes other than DNMT3A (non-DNMT3A CHIP). Longitudinal kidney function endpoints in individuals with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and CHIP have been examined in two previous studies, which reported conflicting findings and were limited by small sample sizes.

MethodsIn this study, we examined the prospective associations between CHIP and CKD progression events in four cohorts of CKD patients (total N = 5,772). The primary outcome was a composite of 50% kidney function decline or kidney failure. The slope of eGFR decline was examined as a secondary outcome. Mendelian randomization techniques were then used to investigate potential causal effects of CHIP on eGFR decline. Finally, kidney function was assessed in adenine-fed CKD model mice having received a bone marrow transplant recapitulatingTet2-CHIP compared to controls transplanted wild-type bone marrow.

ResultsAcross all cohorts, the average age was 66.4 years, the average baseline eGFR was 42.6 ml/min/1.73m2, and 24% had CHIP. Upon meta-analysis, non-DNMT3A CHIP was associated with a 59% higher relative risk of incident CKD progression (HR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.02-2.47). This association was more pronounced among individuals with diabetes (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.03-1.62) and with baseline eGFR [&ge;] 30 ml/min/1.73m (HR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11-2.90). Additionally, the annualized slope of eGFR decline was steeper among non-DNMT3A CHIP carriers, relative to non-carriers ({beta} -0.61 {+/-} 0.31 ml/min/1.73m2, p = 0.04). Mendelian randomization analyses suggested a causal role for CHIP in eGFR decline among individuals with diabetes. In a dietary adenine mouse model of CKD, Tet2-CHIP was associated with lower GFR as well as greater kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis.

ConclusionNon-DNMT3A CHIP is a potentially targetable novel risk factor for CKD progression.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

Here, we present two inactive CCR6 structures determined by cryo-EM in ternary complexes with different allosteric antagonists, CCR6/SQA1/OXM1 and CCR6/SQA1/OXM2.

A U-shaped conformation stabilized by intramolecular interactions was revealed by structural and NMR studies of active OXM analogues. SQA1 is a squaramide (SQA) derivative with close-in analogues that were previously reported to be antagonists of CCR6 and other chemokine receptors.

Using two complementary approaches to examine enrichment between GWAS loci and genomic regions, we show that more phenotypes are enriched in earlier periods of divergence of humans with macaques and chimps, and less so during the divergence with Neanderthals. These traits span respiratory, dermatological, reproductive, metabolic, and psychiatric domains along with skeletal and brain imaging traits, consistent with striking morphological changes between humans and other primates. Among brain imaging traits, we observe an enrichment of SNPs associated with the longitudinal fasciculus in human-gained epigenetic elements since macaques, the visual cortex in HARs, and the thalamus proper in Neanderthal introgressed alleles, implying associated functions such as language processing, decision making, relay of sensory signals, and motor control are enriched at different evolutionary depths.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

CpE binds selectively to membrane protein receptors called claudins on the apical surfaces of small intestinal epithelium. Claudins normally construct tight junctions that regulate epithelial paracellular transport but are hijacked from doing so by CpE and are instead led to form claudin/CpE small complexes. Small complexes are building blocks for assembling oligomeric {beta}-barrel pores that penetrate the plasma membrane and induce gut cytotoxicity.

Here, we conducted clinical surveillance for DENV during the 2023 nationwide outbreak and sequenced DENV whole genomes for the first time in Ethiopia. We enrolled patients at three sentinel hospital sites. Using RT-PCR, we screened serum samples for three arboviruses followed by serotyping and sequencing for DENV-positive samples (10.4% of samples). We detected two DENV serotypes (DENV1 and DENV3). Phylogenetic analysis identified one transmission cluster of DENV1 (genotype III major lineage A), and two clusters of DENV3 (genotype III major lineage B). The first showed close evolutionary relationship to the 2023 Italian outbreak and the second cluster to Indian isolates. Co-circulation of DENV1 and DENV3 in some regions of Ethiopia highlights the potential for severe dengue. Intensified surveillance and coordinated public health response are needed to address the threat of severe dengue outbreaks.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033479

Despite geochemical evidence of active phosphorus cycling in deep-sea cold seep ecosystems, the microbial processes involved remain poorly understood. Traditional sequence-based searches often fail to detect proteins with remote homology. To address this, we developed a protein language model (PLM) named LucaPCycle that integrates sequence and structural information. This PLM-based approach identified 4,606 new phosphorus-cycling protein families based on the non-redundant gene and genome catalogs from global cold seeps, substantially enhancing our understanding of their diversity, ecology, and function. Among previously unannotated sequences, we discovered three novel alkaline phosphatase families (ALP1, ALP2 and ALP3) that feature unique domain organizations and preserved enzymatic capabilities. These results highlight previously overlooked ecological importance of phosphorus cycling within cold seeps, corroborated by data from porewater geochemistry, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics. We identified a previously unrecognized diversity of archaea contributing to organic phosphorus mineralization and inorganic phosphorus solubilization through various mechanisms. This includes ecologically significant groups such as Asgardarchaeota, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME), and Thermoproteota. Additionally, viruses can enhance their hosts (e.g., ANME) phosphorus utilization through the PhoR-PhoB regulatory system and PhnCDE transporter, indirectly influencing methane dynamics. Overall, our PLM-based functional predictions are capable of accessing previously hidden sequence spaces for microbial phosphorus cycling, and can be applied to other various ecosystems.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

SARS-CoV-2 internalization occurs via S-protein-mediated cell binding followed either by direct fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis and subsequent fusion with the endosomal membrane. Despite the crucial role of virus internalization, the precise kinetics of the processes involved remains elusive. We developed a pipeline, which combines live-cell microscopy and advanced image analysis, for measuring the rates of multiple internalization-associated molecular events of single SARS-CoV-2-virus-like particles (VLPs), including endosome ingression, pH change, and nucleocapsid release. Our live-cell imaging experiments demonstrate that only a few minutes after binding to the plasma membrane, VLPs ingress into Rab5-negative endosomes via Dynamin-dependent scission. Less than two minutes later, the pH of VLPs drops below 5 followed by an increase in VLP speed, yet these two events are not interrelated. Nucleocapsid release from the VLPs occurs with similar kinetics to the pH drop, suggesting that VLP fusion occurs during endosome acidification. Neither Omicron mutations nor abrogation of the S protein polybasic cleavage site altered the rate of VLP internalization events, indicating that they do not affect these processes. Finally, we observe that VLP internalization occurs two to three times faster in VeroE6 than in A549 cells, which may contribute to the greater susceptibility of the former cell line to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, our precise measurements of the kinetics of VLP internalization-associated processes shed light on their contribution to the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cells. Time-lapse videos of the studied internalization events can be accessed in the dedicated COVIDynamics database.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

This paper investigates the role of the thalamus, a crucial subcortical structure, in orchestrating these opposing dynamics in the cerebral cortex. Through two distinct classes of cortical projections, the thalamus is able to support distinct dynamics modes: some cells relay precise information between cortical regions, whereas others diffusely modulate ongoing cortical dynamics. Traditional approaches to analysing neural data struggle to capture the moment-to-moment intricacies of brain dynamics, akin to mapping a rivers topography without understanding its flow, or laminarity. Inspired by the field of fluid dynamics, we show that spontaneous fMRI data exhibits non-trivial fluctuations in laminarity. Propofol-induced anesthesia selectively disrupts the non-laminar aspects of cortical dynamics while preserving laminar flow, which we validate with a large-scale biophysical model of the thalamocortical system. Finally, we confirmed theoretical predictions from the biophysical model using multielectrode electrophysiological recordings from the cerebral cortex of an anesthetized macaque - direct stimulation of the diffusely-projecting thalamus restored non-laminar cortical fluctuations and the waking state. We conclude that the thalamus provides versatile control over the cortical laminar and non-laminar flows that characterize conscious states.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the MOW15-22 RBD-ACE2 complex unveil an unexpected and entirely distinct binding mode, mapping 50[A] away from that of any other known ACE2-using coronaviruses. Functional profiling of ACE2 orthologs from 105 mammalian species led to the identification of host tropism determinants, including an ACE2 N432-glycosylation restricting viral recognition, and the design of a soluble P.nat ACE2 mutant with potent viral neutralizing activity. Our findings reveal convergent acquisition of ACE2 usage for merbecoviruses found in European bats, underscoring the extraordinary diversity of ACE2 recognition modes among coronaviruses and the promiscuity of this receptor.

Since the start of the pandemic, eight monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were granted emergency use authorization. High mutation rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to the emergence of highly transmissible variants efficiently evading vaccine-induced immunity. This highlights the importance of identifying broadly neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. In this study, we used a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to identify a subset that bound and neutralized a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Intranasal delivery of XR10, the most promising murine mAb, protected hamsters against infection by Alpha and Delta variants. We next humanized XR10 mAb using a combination of CDR-grafting and Vernier zones preservation approaches (CRVZ) to create a panel of humanized antibody variants. We ranked the variants based on their spike binding ability and virus neutralization. Of these, XR10v48 demonstrated the best ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. XR10v48 was protective in hamsters when given as a single 50 {micro}g/kg intranasal dose at the time of viral challenge. XR10v48 features 34 key amino acid residues retained from the murine progenitor.

The concepts of grammar and semantics from natural language have been shown to be applicable to understanding functional properties of viral proteins like antigenicity.

Applied to SARS-CoV-2s spike protein we demonstrate the PLM, ESM-2, has learned the sequence context within which variation occurs, capturing evolutionary constraint. We demonstrate this recapitulates what conventionally requires MSA data predicting both where variation does and does not accumulate across the protein. We show the PLM-derived measures of amino acid change represent novel metrics as they do not correlate strongly with classical metrics of change in sequences. Applied to SARS-CoV-2 variants across the pandemic we demonstrate that ESM-2 representations encode the relatedness between variants, i.e., their evolutionary history, as well as the distinct nature of variants of concern upon their emergence, associated with shifts in receptor binding and antigenicity. This application of ESM-2 can be used for characterising the evolutionary potential and possible epidemiological impact of both existing and emerging variation, with the potential to be applied to any protein sequence, pathogen or otherwise.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

This inherent catalytic feature of condensates derives from the electrochemical environments and the electric fields at interfaces that are direct consequences of phase separation. The condensates we studied were capable of catalyzing diverse hydrolysis reactions, including hydrolysis and radical-dependent breakdown of ATP whereby ATP fully decomposes to adenine and multiple carbohydrates. This distinguishes condensates from naturally occurring ATPases, which can only catalyze the dephosphorylation of ATP. Interphase and interfacial properties of condensates can be tuned via sequence design, thus enabling control over catalysis through sequence-dependent electrochemical features of condensates. Incorporation of hydrolase-like synthetic condensates into live cells enables activation of transcriptional circuits that depend on products of hydrolysis reactions. Inherent catalytic functions of condensates, which are emergent consequences of phase separation, are likely to affect metabolic regulation in cells.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

Fast subsecond fluctuations in neuronal population responses dominate the temporal dynamics of neural circuits. Traditional approaches have treated this activity as ""noise"" that can be averaged away by taking the mean spiking rate over wide time bins or over multiple trial repetitions, but this ignores much of the temporal dynamics that naturally occur in neural systems. We find that subsecond flares of increased population activity are layer- and cell-type specific, and large-scale computational modelling suggests they may serve as an inter-areal gating mechanism. Moreover, we find that most of the neural variability is restricted to a population-gain axis.

However, a significant and yet unexplained branch length variation of Y chromosome lineages has been observed, notably amongst those that are highly diverged from the human reference Y chromosome. Understanding the origin of this variation, which has previously been attributed to changes in generation time, mutation rate, or efficacy of selection, is important for accurately reconstructing human evolutionary and demographic history.

Here, we analyze Y chromosomes from present-day and ancient modern humans, as well as Neandertals, and show that branch length variation amongst human Y chromosomes cannot solely be explained by differences in demographic or biological processes. Instead, reference bias results in mutations being missed on Y chromosomes that are highly diverged from the reference used for alignment. We show that masking fast-evolving, highly divergent regions of the human Y chromosome mitigates the effect of this bias and enables more accurate determination of branch lengths in the Y chromosome phylogeny. Finally, we show that this approach allows us to estimate the age of ancient samples from Y chromosome sequence data and provide updated TMRCA estimates using the portion of the Y chromosome where the effect of reference bias is minimised.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

A recent federal ban prevents SSPs from using federal funding to procure safer smoking supplies. There is a lack of research on safer smoking supply distribution and harm reduction outcomes. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between distribution of safer smoking supplies by SSPs and levels of participant engagement and naloxone distribution.

MethodsWe used data from the 2023 National Survey of Syringe Services Programs (NSSSP) (N=429), which measured services delivered in 2022. SSPs reported whether they distributed safer smoking pipes (yes/no). We examined the relationship between safer smoking pipe distribution and two outcomes: the number of participant encounters and naloxone doses distributed.

ResultsThere were 187 SSPs (43.6%) that distributed pipes for smoking to participants. Compared to SSPs that did not distribute pipes, those that distributed pipes reported more participant encounters (aRR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.09-2.02) and naloxone dose distribution (aRR=1.21, 95% CI: 0.89-1.65), though this latter finding was not statistically significant.

ConclusionsFindings showed SSPs distributing safer smoking pipes had more participant engagement and naloxone distribution. To maximize their full individual and population-level health benefits, SSPs should be supported technically, legally, and financially to implement safer smoking supply distribution for their participants.

HighlightsO_LIIn 2022, 44% of syringe services programs (SSPs) distributed safer smoking pipes.
C_LIO_LIMore community-based organizations distributed pipes than public health or health care programs.

The extent to which this depends on how different INs process excitatory signals along their dendrites is poorly understood. Here, we reveal that the functional specialization of two major populations of cortical INs is determined by the unique association of different dendritic integration modes with distinct synaptic organization motifs. We found that somatostatin (SST)-INs exhibit NMDAR-dependent dendritic integration and uniform synapse density along the dendritic tree. In contrast, dendrites of parvalbumin (PV)-INs exhibit passive synaptic integration coupled with proximally enriched synaptic distributions. Theoretical analysis shows that these two dendritic configurations result in different strategies to optimize synaptic efficacy in thin dendritic structures. Yet, the two configurations lead to distinct temporal engagement of each IN during network activity. We confirmed these predictions with in vivo recordings of IN activity in the visual cortex of awake mice, revealing a rapid and linear recruitment of PV-INs as opposed to a long-lasting integrative activation of SST-INs. Our work reveals the existence of distinct dendritic strategies that confer distinct temporal representations for the two major classes of neocortical INs and thus dynamics of inhibition.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

However, central metabolism corresponds to only a small fraction of the biosynthetic potential of microbes: metabolites such as antimicrobial compounds, signaling molecules, and co-factors are underexplored forces shaping microbial communities. Here, we focus on B vitamin exchange in coastal marine bacterial communities that degrade particulate organic matter and find that natural seawater communities are vitamin limited. While almost a third of bacterial isolates from these communities are B vitamin auxotrophs, the pioneering degraders that first arrive on particles are vitamin producers that likely support auxotrophs through cross-feeding. However, combining experiments and a resource-explicit model, we show that auxotroph growth is often not restored by coculture with vitamin producers, but rather requires lysis and subsequent vitamin recycling. Our results highlight the importance of vitamin auxotrophies and lysis-mediated cross-feeding as important factors controlling microbial community assembly and succession on marine particles.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033479

The availability of large collections of bacterial genomes has made genome-wide association studies (GWAS) a common approach for this purpose. The need to employ multiple software tools for data pre- and post-processing limits the application of these methods by experienced bioinformaticians. To address this issue, we have developed a pipeline to perform bacterial GWAS from a set of assemblies and annotations, with multiple phenotypes as targets. The associations are run using five sets of genetic variants: unitigs, gene presence/absence, rare variants (i.e. gene burden test), gene cluster specific k-mers, and all unitigs jointly. All variants passing the association threshold are further annotated to identify overrepresented biological processes and pathways. The results can be further augmented by generating a phylogenetic tree and by predicting the presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence associated genes. We tested the microGWAS pipeline on a previously reported dataset on E. coli virulence, successfully identifying the causal variants, and providing further interpretation on the association results. The microGWAS pipeline integrates the state-of-the-art tools to perform bacterial GWAS into a single, user-friendly, and reproducible pipeline, allowing for the democratization of these analyses.

ResultsGeometrical gene expression signature analysis demonstrated high utility to detect sub-groups with enhanced treatment response. In the Pfizer trial, gene expression signatures were able to detect three subgroups of responders (p = 0.012), containing 52.9% of patients and accounting for nearly all the observed treatment effect.

One of the best-understood systems for division site selection is the Min system in Escherichia coli. In E. coli, the Min system displays remarkable pole-to-pole oscillation, creating a time-averaged minimum at the cells geometric center, which marks the future division site. Interestingly, the Gram-positive model species Bacillus subtilis also encodes homologous proteins: the cell division inhibitor MinC and the Walker-ATPase MinD. However, B. subtilis lacks the activating protein MinE, which is essential for Min dynamics in E. coli. We have shown before that the B. subtilis Min system is highly dynamic and quickly relocalizes to active sites of division. This raised questions about how Min protein dynamics are regulated on a molecular level in B. subtilis. Here, we show with a combination of in vitro experiments and in vivo single-molecule imaging that the ATPase activity of B. subtilis MinD is activated solely by membrane binding. Additionally, both monomeric and dimeric MinD bind to the membrane, and binding of ATP to MinD is a prerequisite for fast membrane detachment. Single-molecule localization microscopy data confirm membrane binding of monomeric MinD variants. However, only wild type MinD enriches at cell poles and sites of ongoing division, likely due to interaction with MinJ. Monomeric MinD variants and locked dimers remain distributed along the membrane and lack the characteristic pattern formation. Single-molecule tracking data further support that MinD has a freely diffusive population, which is increased in the monomeric variants and a membrane binding defective mutant. Thus, MinD dynamics in B. subtilis do not require any unknown protein component and can be fully explained by MinDs binding and unbinding kinetics with the membrane. The generation of MinD patterns relies on the short-lived temporal residence of MinD dimers at the membrane.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

We find subsets of reprogramming resistant cells that fail to form functional cell types, undergo cell death, or disrupt normal body patterning.

EF is thought to remove tissue-resident bacteria that have been previously detected in the bladder walls of postmenopausal women with rUTI. We hypothesized that increased bladder bacterial burden may be associated with incomplete rUTI resolution following EF.

MethodsFollowing IRB approval, bladder biopsies were obtained from 34 consenting menopausal women electing EF for the advanced management of rUTI. 16S rRNA FISH was performed using both universal and Escherichia probes and tissue-resident bacterial load was quantified. Time to UTI relapse after EF was recorded during a six-month follow-up period and the association of bladder bacterial burden and clinical covariates with UTI relapse was assessed.

ResultsWe observed bladder-resident Escherichia in 52% of all participants and in 92% of participants with recent E. coli UTI. Time-to-relapse analysis revealed that women with high bladder bacterial burden as detected by the universal probe had a significantly (p=0.035) higher risk of UTI within six months of EF (HR=3.15, 95% CI: 1.09-9.11). Interestingly, bladder-resident Escherichia was not significantly associated (p=0.26) with a higher risk of UTI relapse (HR= 2.14, 95% CI: 0.58-7.90).

ConclusionsWe observed that total bladder bacterial burden was associated with a 3.1x increased risk of rUTI relapse within six months.

Collectively these areas have been implicated in many higher-level affective and cognitive processes, most notably the adaptive control of decision-making. Despite this appreciation, little is known about how subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex dynamically interact with each other during decision-making. Here we assessed functional interactions between areas by analyzing the activity of thousands of single neurons recorded from eight anatomically defined subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex in macaques performing a visually guided two-choice probabilistic task for different fruit juices. We found that the onset of stimuli and reward delivery globally increased communication between all parts of ventral frontal cortex. Inter-areal communication was, however, temporally specific, occurred through unique activity subspaces between areas, and depended on the encoding of decision variables. In particular, areas 12l and 12o showed the highest connectivity with other areas while being more likely to receive information from other parts of ventral frontal cortex than to send it. This pattern of functional connectivity suggests a role for these two areas in integrating diverse sources of information during decision processes. Taken together, our work reveals the specific patterns of inter-areal communication between anatomically connected subdivisions of ventral frontal cortex that are dynamically engaged during decision-making.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

We discovered that the Marchantia spore undergoes a series of precisely oriented cell divisions to generate a flat prothallus on which a meristem later develops de novo. The young sporeling comprises an early cell mass. One cell of the early cell mass elongates and undergoes a formative division that produces the prothalloblast, which initiates prothallus formation. A symmetric division of the prothalloblast followed by two transverse divisions generate a four-celled plate that expands into a flat disc through oblique divisions in three of the four plate cell-derived quadrants. One quadrant gives rise to a flat flabellum. A notch with a meristem and apical stem cell develops at the margin of the flabellum.

Here, using 13C labelling studies, we demonstrate that the archaeal model organisms Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Haloferax volcanii are capable of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Biochemical characterization and in vitro pathway reconstitution identify the key enzymes of a newly proposed fatty acid synthesis pathway in S. acidocaldarius and show that ketothiolase, ketoacyl-CoA reductase, and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase form a stable assembly mediated by a DUF35 domain protein, which represents the first characterization of an archaeal fatty acid synthase complex. The final step is catalysed by an NADPH-dependent enoyl-CoA reductase. Deletion of the enoyl-CoA reductase demonstrate that this pathway operates in vivo in S. acidocaldarius. The presented results including phylogenetic analysis reveal that the potential to synthesize fatty acids is widespread across archaeal lineages.

We apply this new information to a specific application: the use of the retron to produce a precise genome editing donor in combination with a CRISPR-Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (an editron). We use high-throughput libraries in S. cerevisiae to additionally define design rules for editrons. We extend our new knowledge of retron DNA production and editron design rules to human genome editing to achieve the highest efficiency retron-Eco1 editrons to date.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

We introduce predictive attention mechanisms (PAMs) - a novel approach that dynamically derives queries during training which is beneficial when predefined queries are unavailable. We applied PAMs to neural decoding, a field challenged by the inherent complexity of neural data that prevents access to queries. Concretely, we designed a PAM to reconstruct perceived images from brain activity via the latent space of a generative adversarial network (GAN). We processed stimulus-evoked brain activity from various visual areas with separate attention heads, transforming it into a latent vector which was then fed to the GANs generator to reconstruct the visual stimulus. Driven by prediction-target discrepancies during training, PAMs optimized their queries to identify and prioritize the most relevant neural patterns that required focused attention. We validated our PAM with two datasets: the first dataset (B2G) with GAN-synthesized images, their original latents and multi-unit activity data; the second dataset (GOD) with real photographs, their inverted latents and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Our findings demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstructions of perception and show that attention weights increasingly favor downstream visual areas. Moreover, visualizing the values from different brain areas enhanced interpretability in terms of their contribution to the final image reconstruction. Interestingly, the values from downstream areas (IT for B2G; LOC for GOD) appeared visually distinct from the stimuli despite receiving the most attention. This suggests that these values help guide the model to important latent regions, integrating information necessary for high-quality reconstructions. Taken together, this work advances visual neuroscience and sets a new standard for machine learning applications in interpreting complex data.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

Recent studies have shown that some archaea and bacteria contain alternative histones that exhibit different DNA binding properties, in addition to highly divergent sequences. However, the vast majority of these new histones are identified in metagenomes and thus are difficult to study in vivo. The recent revolutionary breakthroughs in computational protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAfold allow for unprecedented insights into the potential function and structure of previously uncharacterized proteins. Here, we categorize the prokaryotic histone space into 17 distinct groups based on AlphaFold2 predictions. We identify a new superfamily of histones, termed 3 histones, which are common in archaea and present in several bacteria. Importantly, we establish the existence of a large family of histones throughout archaea and in some bacteriophages that, instead of wrapping DNA, bridge DNA, thereby diverging from conventional nucleosomal histones.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

While aging is accompanied by mutation accumulation -- widely understood to contribute to cancer risk -- it is also associated with numerous other cellular and molecular changes likely to impact tumorigenesis. Moreover, cancer incidence decreases in the oldest part of the population, suggesting that very old age may reduce carcinogenesis. Here we show that aging represses tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of human lung cancer. Moreover, aging dampens the impact of inactivating many, but not all, tumor suppressor genes with the impact of inactivating PTEN, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, weakened to a disproportionate extent. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis revealed that neoplastic cells from tumors in old mice retain many age-related transcriptomic changes, showing that age has an enduring impact that persists through oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, the consequences of PTEN inactivation were strikingly age-dependent, with PTEN deficiency reducing signatures of aging in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our findings suggest that the relationship between age and lung cancer incidence may reflect an integration of the competing effects of driver mutation accumulation and tumor suppressive effects of aging.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

The huge number of scientific articles with the term arousal (~50.000) highlights the importance of the concept but also explains why such a vast literature has never been systematically reviewed so far. Here, we leverage the tools of natural language processing to probe the nature of arousal in a data-driven, comprehensive manner. We show that arousal comes in seven varieties: cognitive, emotional, physiological, sexual, related to stress disorders, to sleep, or to sleep disorders. We then ask whether domain-general arousal exists, and run meta-analyses of the brain imaging literature to reveal that all varieties of arousal, except arousal in sleep disorders for lack of data, converge onto a cortical arousal network composed of the pre-supplementary motor area and the left and right dorsal anterior insula. More precisely, we find that activity in dysgranular insular area 7, the region with the highest convergence across varieties of arousal is also specific to arousal. Our results show that arousal corresponds to a construct at least partially shared across different domains of neuroscience and identify the domain-general cortical arousal network. Novel taxonomies of arousal reconciling seemingly opposing views on what arousal is should thus include domain-general arousal as a central component.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

Conversely, marine photosynthetic diversity is dominated by plastids gained by subsequent endosymbioses of photosynthetic eukaryotes, so-called  complex plastids. The plastids of major eukaryotic lineages including cryptophytes, haptophytes, stramenopiles, dinoflagellates and apicomplexans, were originally all posited to derive from a single secondary endosymbiosis of a red alga--the  chromalveloate hypothesis 1. Subsequent phylogenetic resolution of eukaryotes indicated that separate events of plastid acquisition must have occurred to account for this distribution of plastids 2,3. The number of such events, however, and the donor organisms for the new plastid endosymbioses are still not resolved. A perceived bottleneck of endosymbiotic plastid gain is the development of protein targeting from the hosts into new plastids, and this supposition has often driven hypotheses towards minimising the number of plastid-gain events to explain plastid distribution in eukaryotes. But how plastid protein-targeting is established for new endosymbionts is often unclear, which makes it difficult to assess the likelihood of plastid transfers between lineages. Here we show that Kareniaceae dinoflagellates, that possess complex plastids known to be derived from haptophytes, acquired all the necessary protein import machinery from these haptophytes. Furthermore, cryo-electron tomography revealed that no additional membranes were added to the Kareniaceae complex plastid during serial endosymbiosis, suggesting that the haptophyte-derived import processes were sufficient. Our analyses suggests that complex red plastids are preadapted for horizontal transmission, potentially explaining their widespread distribution in aquatic algal diversity.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

We observed history-dependent spike back-propagation in distal dendrites, driven by locally generated Na+ spikes (dSpikes). Dendritic depolarization created a transient window for dSpike propagation, opened by A-type KV channel inactivation, and closed by slow NaV inactivation.

We observed a hexadirectional modulation of the activity in entorhinal cortex while participants compared different action plans. Furthermore, hippocampal activity scaled with the 2D similarity between outcomes of these action plans. Conversely, the supplementary motor area (SMA) represented individual actions, showing a stronger response to overlapping action plans. Crucially, the connectivity between hippocampus and SMA was modulated by the similarity between the action plans, suggesting their complementary roles in action evaluation. These findings provide evidence for the role of cognitive maps in action selection, challenging classical models of memory taxonomy and its neural bases.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

The increased trend towards long term continuous neural recordings have spurred efforts to realize active commutators that can sense the torsional stress and actively rotation the slip ring to alleviate torsional stresses.

Our cellular and genomic analyses in Timema stick insects reveal that within cell variation of the major centromere protein CenH3 recapitulates the variation typically observed across species. While CenH3-containing nucleosomes are distributed in a monocentric fashion on autosomes and bind tandem repeat sequences specific to individual or small groups of chromosomes, they exhibit a holocentric-like distribution on the sex chromosome and bind to more complex intergenic regions. Despite this contrasting distribution, all chromosomes, including the sex chromosome, attach to spindle microtubules at a single location, marking the first instance of a functionally monocentric species with holocentric-like attributes.

Predictive processing theories posit that psychedelics work by loosening priors or high-level beliefs, including ingrained biases that have become pathological, leading to shifts in bottom-up vs top-down information processing that reconfigure perception, cognition, and mood. Because 5-HT2A receptors, the primary target of psychedelics, are enriched in visual cortices, we investigated whether psychedelics alter visual processing in a manner consistent with predictive processing theories. People who recently (<3 weeks) used 5-HT2A-agonist psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) exhibited slowed response latencies and increased cortical involvement in generating saccades to targets in predictable locations, along with a generalization of sensory prediction errors (i.e., deviance detection) during passive visual processing. Individuals who recently used a 5-HT1A- selective psychedelic (5-MeO-DMT) displayed similar changes in saccade production, but unaltered deviance detection, suggesting circuit-specific effects.

Subsequently, JN.1 subvariants including KP.2 and KP.3, which convergently acquired S protein substitutions such as S:R346T, S:F456L, and S:Q493E, have emerged concurrently. Furthermore, JN.1 subvariants such as LB.1 and KP.2.3, which convergently acquired S:S31del in addition to the above substitutions, have emerged and spread as of June 2024. Here we investigated the virological properties of KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3. We estimated the relative effective reproduction number (Re) of KP.3, LB.1, and KP.2.3 using a Bayesian multinomial logistic model based on the genome surveillance data from Canada, the UK, and the USA, where these variants have spread from March to April 2024. The Re of KP.3 is more than 1.2-fold higher than that of JN.1 and higher than or comparable to that of KP.2 in these countries. Importantly, the Re values of LB.1 and KP.2.3 are even higher than those of KP.2 and KP.3. These results suggest that the three variants we investigated herein, particularly LB.1, and KP.2.3, will become major circulating variants worldwide in addition to KP.2 and KP.3. The pseudovirus infectivity of KP.2 and KP.3 was significantly lower than that of JN.1. On the other hand, the pseudovirus infectivity of LB.1 and KP.2.3 was comparable to that of JN.1. Neutralization assay was conducted by using four types of breakthrough infection (BTI) sera with XBB.1.5, EG.5, HK.3 and JN.1 infections as well as monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccine sera. In all four groups of BTI sera tested, the 50% neutralization titers (NT50) against LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those against JN.1 (2.2-3.3-fold and 2.0-2.9-fold) and even lower than those against KP.2 (1.6-1.9-fold and 1.4-1.7 fold). Although KP.3 exhibited neutralization resistance against all BTI sera tested than JN.1 (1.6-2.2-fold) with statistical significance, there were no significant differences between KP.3 and KP.2. In the case of infection-naive XBB.1.5 vaccine sera, the NT50 values of JN.1 subvariants were very low. In the case of XBB.1.5 vaccine sera after natural XBB infection, the NT50 values against KP.3, LB.1 and KP.2.3 were significantly lower than those of JN.1 (2.1-2.8-fold) and even lower than KP.2 after infection (1.4-2.0-fold). Overall, our results suggest that the S substitutions convergently acquired in the JN.1 subvariants contribute to immune evasion, and therefore, increase their Re when compared to parental JN.1. More importantly, LB.1 and KP.2.3 exhibited higher pseudovirus infectivity and more robust immune resistance than KP.2. These data suggest that S:S31del is critical to exhibit increased infectivity, increased immune evasion, and therefore, potentially contributes to increased Re.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored. One mammalian family, the Felidae, is of particular concern. Felids, known as felines or cats, are susceptible to avian influenza virus infection. Felines prey on wild birds and may serve as a host for avian influenza virus adaptation to mammals. Feline-to-feline transmission has been demonstrated experimentally [1], and real-world outbreaks have been reported [2,3]. Domestic cats are a popular human companion animal and thus provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses to humans. Here, we provide a systematic review of the scientific literature to describe the epidemiology and global distribution of avian influenza virus infections in felines reported from 2004 - 2024. We aim to provide a comprehensive background for the assessment of the current risk, as well as bring awareness to the recurring phenomenon of AIV infection in felines.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033480

We aimed to evaluate the presence and potential bias of this advocacy.

Design and MethodsScopus was searched for items published until April 13, 2024 on ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2"". BMJ publication numbers and types before (2016-2019) and during (2020-2023) the pandemic were compared for a group of advocates favoring aggressive measures (leaders of both the Independent Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (indieSAGE) and the Vaccines-Plus initiative) and four control groups: leading members of the governmental Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), UK-based key signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD) (favoring more restricted measures), highly-cited UK scientists, and UK scientists who published the highest number of COVID-19-related papers in the entire scientific literature (n=16 in each group).

Results122 authors published more than 5 COVID-19-related items each in BMJ. Of those, 18 were leading members/signatories of aggressive measures advocacy groups publishing 231 COVID-19 related BMJ documents, 53 were editors/journalists, and 51 scientists were not identified as associated with any advocacy. Of 41 authors with >10 publications in BMJ, 8 were scientists advocating for aggressive measures, 7 were editors, 23 were journalists, and only 3 were non-advocate scientists. Some aggressive measures advocates already had strong BMJ presence pre-pandemic. During pandemic years, the studied indieSAGE/Vaccines-Plus advocates outperformed in BMJ presence leading SAGE members by 16.0-fold, UK-based GBD advocates by 64.2-fold, the most-cited scientists by 16.0-fold, and the authors who published most COVID-19 papers overall by 10.7-fold. The difference was driven mainly by short opinion pieces and analyses.

ConclusionsBMJ appears to have favored and massively promoted specific COVID-19 advocacy views during the pandemic, thereby strongly biasing the scientific picture on COVID-19.

It is estimated that 783 million by 2045 will live with diabetes worldwide, 90% of those cases are type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a multifaceted disease, its treatment requires a holistic approach, beyond single target medications with high efficacy. There is a dire need to explore and invent new and effective therapeutic modalities for T2D.

In this study we tested whether a combined formulation of cannabidiol (CBD) and probiotics could control glycemic indices and alleviate symptoms of T2D. We used a mouse model of T2D, replaced their drinking water with a combination of CBD and probiotics formulated as a commercially available beverage.

Our findings demonstrated that combination of CBD and probiotics not only reduced the glycemic indices (HbA1c & FBG), but also altered the microbiome profile, promoted beneficial bacteria. Further, the CBD/probiotic combination reduced peripheral inflammatory cytokines and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic islets.

In conclusion, our results suggest that consumption of combined CBD and probiotics could be used as a natural, practical, affordable, and safe alternative and complementary therapeutic modality to treat T2D.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

Given the recent detection of HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle and H5N1 RNA detections in pasteurized retail milk in the United States, we established the Pan-Canadian Milk (PCM) Network. Through our network of collaborators from across Canada, retail milk is being procured longitudinally and sent to a central laboratory for testing for the presence of influenza A virus RNA. To date (05 July 2024), we have tested 92 retail milk samples from all ten Canadian provinces (NL, NS, PEI, NB, QC, ON, MB, SK, AB, and BC) and all have tested negative for influenza A virus RNA. Testing is ongoing and these results will be updated on rolling basis as additional data becomes available. Despite no known HPAI infections of dairy cattle in Canada to date, H5N1 poses a significant threat to the health of both humans and other animals. Routine surveillance of retail milk on a national scale will allow for monitoring of infected dairy cattle on an ongoing basis in a cost-effective, standardized, scalable and easily accessible manner. Our network and testing will act as an early detection system to help inform containment and mitigation activities if positive samples are identified.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033480

The striped variety has attracted particular attention for its intricate and unpredictable patterns. A good understanding of the mechanism that drives the striped pattern formation of the broken tulips has been missing since the 17th century. It is known since 1928 that these patterned tulips suffer from a viral infection by the tulip breaking virus. Here, we present a mathematical model to understand how a virus infection of the petals can lead to stripes, thereby solving a 350 year old mystery. The model, which describes the viral inhibition of pigment expression (anthocyanins) and their interaction with viral reproduction, incorporates a pattern formation mechanism identified as an activator-substrate mechanism, similar to the well-known Turing instability, working together with a Wolperts positional information mechanism. The model is solved on a growing tulip petal shaped domain, whereby we introduce a new method to describe the tulip petal growth explicitly. This work contributes to the theory of pattern formation of reaction-diffusion systems on growing domains applied to the fields of virology and botany.","NA","biorxiv",1720822033480

DesignNested population-based case-control study.

SettingComprehensive outpatient assessment, including neurocognitive, cardiopulmonary exercise, and laboratory testing in four university health centres in southwestern Germany (2022).

ParticipantsPCS cases aged 18 to 65 years with (n=982) and age and sex-matched controls without PCS (n=576) according to an earlier population-based questionnaire study (six to 12 months after acute infection, phase 1) consenting to provide follow-up information and to undergo clinical diagnostic assessment (phase 2, another 8.5 months [median] after phase 1).

Main outcome measuresRelative frequencies of symptoms and health problems and distribution of symptom scores and diagnostic test results between persistent cases and controls. Additional analysis included predictors of changing case or control status over time with adjustments for potentially confounding variables.

ResultsAt the time of clinical examination (phase 2), 67.6% of the initial cases (phase 1) remained cases, whereas 78.5% of the controls continued to report no health problems related to PCS. In adjusted analyses, predictors of improvement among cases were mild acute index infection, previous full-time employment, educational status, and no specialist consultation and not attending a rehabilitation programme. Among controls, predictors of new symptoms or worsening with PCS development were an intercurrent secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection and educational status. At phase 2, persistent cases were less frequently never smokers, had higher values for BMI and body fat, and had lower educational status than controls. Fatigue/exhaustion, neurocognitive disturbance, chest symptoms/breathlessness and anxiety/depression/sleep problems remained the predominant symptom clusters, and exercise intolerance with post-exertional malaise for >14 h (PEM) and symptoms compatible with ME/CFS (according to Canadian consensus criteria) were reported by 35.6% and 11.6% of persistent cases, respectively. In adjusted analyses, significant differences between persistent cases and stable controls (at phase 2) were observed for neurocognitive test performances, scores for perceived stress and subjective cognitive disturbances, symptoms indicating dysautonomia, depression and anxiety, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life. In persistent cases, handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption, and ventilator efficiency were significantly reduced. However, there were no differences in measures of systolic and diastolic cardiac function, in the level of pro-BNP blood levels or other laboratory measurements (including complement activity, serological markers of EBV reactivation, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cortisol, ACTH and DHEA-S serum levels). Screening for viral persistence (based on PCR in stool samples and SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen levels in plasma in a subgroup of the cases) was negative. Sensitivity analyses (pre-existing illness/comorbidity, obesity, PEM, medical care of the index acute infection) revealed similar findings and showed that persistent cases with PEM reported more pain symptoms and had worse results in almost all tests.

ConclusionsThis nested population-based case-control study demonstrates that the majority of PCS cases do not recover in the second year of their illness, with patterns of reported symptoms remaining essentially similar, nonspecific and dominated by fatigue, exercise intolerance and cognitive complaints. We found objective signs of cognitive deficits and reduced exercise capacity likely to be unrelated to primary cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction in some of the cases, but there was no major pathology in laboratory investigations. A history of PEM >14 h which was associated with more severe symptoms as well as with more objective signs of disease may be a pragmatic means to stratify cases for disease severity.

What is already known on this topicSelf-reported health problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection have commonly been described and may persist for months. They typically include relatively non-specific complaints such as fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, concentration or memory disturbance and sleep problems. The incidence of this post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is varying and associated with sociodemographic variables, pre-existing disease and comorbidities, the severity of the acute SARS-CoV-2 index infection, and some other factors. The long-term prognosis is unknown and may differ for different symptoms or symptom clusters. Evidence of measurable single or multiple organ dysfunction and pathology and their correlation with self-reported symptoms in patients with non-recovery from PCS for more than a year have not been well described.

What this study addsThe study describes the severity of the index infection, lower educational status, no previous full-time employment, and (need for) specialist consultation or a rehabilitation programme (the latter probably due to reverse causation) as factors for non-recovery from PCS, and found no major changes in symptom clusters among PCS cases persisting for more than a year. After a comprehensive medical evaluation of cases and controls and adjusted analyses, objective signs of organ dysfunction and pathology among persistent PCS cases correlated with self-reported symptoms, were detected more often among cases with longer lasting post-exertional malaise, and included both reduced physical exercise capacity (diminished handgrip strength, maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency), and reduced cognitive test performances while there were no differences in the results of multiple laboratory investigations after adjustment for possible confounders.","NA","medrxiv",1720822033480

MethodsWe searched Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL, Embase Classic+Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to update our searches to July 8, 2023. Search results for observational studies were limited to publication dates from 2014 to capture more relevant studies. Screening was performed independently and in duplicate by the review team. To expedite the screening process, machine learning was used to prioritize relevant references. Critical health outcomes, as outlined by the CTFPHC, included breast cancer and all-cause mortality, treatment-related morbidity, and overdiagnosis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non/quasi RCTs, and observational studies were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by one reviewer and verified by another. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists for non-randomized and observational studies. When deemed appropriate, studies were pooled via random-effects models. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed following GRADE guidance.

ResultsThree new papers reporting on existing RCT trial data and 26 observational studies were included. No new RCTs were identified in this update. No study reported results by ethnicity, race, proportion of study population with dense breasts, or socioeconomic status.

For breast cancer mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a significant relative reduction in the risk of breast cancer mortality with screening mammography for a general population of 15% (RR 0.85 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93). In this review update, the breast cancer mortality relative risk reduction based on RCT data remained the same, and absolute effects by age decade over 10 years were 0.27 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.50 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.65 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 0.92 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. For observational data, the relative mortality risk reduction ranged from 29% to 62%. Absolute effects from breast cancer mortality over 10 years ranged from 0.79 to 0.94 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 1.45 to 1.72 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 1.89 to 2.24 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 2.68 to 3.17 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74.

For all-cause mortality, RCT data from the prior review reported a non-significant relative reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality of screening mammography for a general population of 1% (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.00). In this review update, the absolute effects for all-cause mortality over 10 years by age decade were 0.13 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 40 to 49; 0.31 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 59; 0.71 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 60 to 69; and 1.41 fewer deaths per 1,000 in those aged 70 to 74. No observational data were found for all-cause mortality.

For overdiagnosis, this review update found the absolute effects for RCT data (range of follow-up between 9 and 15 years) to be 1.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1 more invasive cancer per 1,000, for those aged 40 to 49 and 1.93 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 1.18 more invasive cancers per 1,000, for those aged 50 to 59. A sensitivity analysis removing high risk of bias studies found 1.57 more invasive and in situ cancers, or 0.49 more invasive cancers, per 1,000 for those aged 40 to 49 and 3.95 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000, or 2.81 more invasive cancers per 1,000, in those aged 50 to 59. For observational data, one report (follow-up for 13 years) found 0.34 more invasive and in situ cancers per 1,000 in those aged 50 to 69.

Overall, the GRADE certainty of evidence was assessed as low or very low, suggesting that the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of screening for breast cancer on the outcomes evaluated in this review.

ConclusionsThis systematic review update did not identify any new trials comparing breast cancer screening to no screening. Although 26 new observational studies were identified, the overall quality of evidence remains generally low or very low. Future research initiatives should prioritize studying screening in higher risk populations such as those from different ages, racial or ethnic groups, with dense breasts, or family history.
